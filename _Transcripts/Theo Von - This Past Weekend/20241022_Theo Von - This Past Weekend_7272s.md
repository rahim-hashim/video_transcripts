*  But Ohio State Michigan just turns into it. He turns into a total animal. So this is 2006 [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=256.2s)]
*  Who is he the senator you're talking about? No, no, no, it's totally different guy. This is a buddy [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=262.4s)]

*  We're number one. They're number two. I think we win that game like 42 39. It's very very tight game [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=270.76s)]
*  I don't remember the exact score and we're leaving and there's this family and this kid is like, you know [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=276.7s)]

*  Are you sad that Michigan lost a little boy goes? Yeah, and he says well, maybe next time you won't root for a team [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=297.53999999999996s)]
*  That sucks [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=302.65999999999997s)]
*  We should try to be nicer to the new [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=307.38s)]
*  But then like you realize well that's actually [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=310.9s)]
*  No, but that's why Ohio State Michigan hate each other right cuz that kid was probably nine years old [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=315.02s)]
*  So this is 2006. I mean, he's I don't know close to 25 now [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=320.74s)]
*  He probably still remembers that asshole from Ohio State [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=325.18s)]
*  Yeah, he was crying after a game and like that's what makes the right now that Tom Brady [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=329.48s)]
*  That's how it gets oh dude, I remember the craziest thing I ever saw was there was a [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=337.09999999999997s)]
*  Mexican father and son [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=343.18s)]
*  Balling crying when the Rock came back one night at WWE. Yeah [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=345.3s)]
*  Standing there together same height. That's a balling crying [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=350.14s)]
*  They both had belts on yeah was like yeah. Yeah. I mean those are [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=355.38s)]
*  It's like the little rituals that actually make life worth it man [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=360.94s)]
*  Yeah, but definitely I mean like like my son he's seven now, but I took him to the Ohio State Michigan game [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=364.4s)]
*  I think the last [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=370.35999999999996s)]
*  when I took I took him to the game last year, but then we you know we watch it even when he's like four years old and [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=372.44s)]
*  Michigan has beat Ohio State the last three years and so it's just like you know [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=379.47999999999996s)]
*  The first time I ever saw my kid cry over sports event was last year at the Ohio State Michigan game [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=384.15999999999997s)]
*  When they beat him when when when Michigan beat Ohio State yeah [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=388.59999999999997s)]
*  When you cry when your team wins that means something is probably you have parenting issues in your home [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=391.88s)]
*  Definitely right that's definitely right, but I mean it's it's like I mean Ohio State just lost a work in a couple [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=400.28s)]
*  You know like a week ago [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=405.78s)]
*  I guess and you sort of realize [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=406.96s)]
*  Like I get so much joy out of watching sports and like taking my son to the Ohio State Michigan games like one of the coolest [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=409.24s)]
*  Moments of my life as a father, but then it almost always ends in heartbreak [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=415.03999999999996s)]
*  Yeah, because only one team actually wins the championship and I sometimes wonder like why don't we put ourselves through this? [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=419.4s)]
*  It's so true that such that it is [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=426.15999999999997s)]
*  Yeah at a certain point you're the odds are you're gonna face not feeling great. Yeah, that it's gonna end right [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=428.44s)]
*  Yeah, I mean like I guess the one team in my lifetime like the Bulls in the 90s [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=435.03999999999996s)]
*  Chicago bulls in the 90s and the Patriots when they had the Brady Belichick run like most of the time [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=441.08s)]
*  You're actually happy if you're a fan of that team [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=446.9s)]
*  But I mean like I'm a Bengals fan [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=449.14s)]
*  In in pro sports and like they made the Super Bowl a few years ago, and it was so cool. Yeah, I remember that [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=451.82s)]
*  It's 49ers [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=458.08s)]
*  Wasn't 49ers [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=459.7s)]
*  It's funny. I don't even remember they were playing against but I remember they lost at the very end [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=461.73999999999995s)]
*  It was a very close game. We almost put it off [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=464.94s)]
*  But then it's like all the joy turned into complete sadness [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=467.53999999999996s)]
*  Like I'm a grown man on the verge of tears because [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=471.62s)]
*  Fucking sports team that I root for lost a game. Wait, you know, wake up man. I think I wonder what it is [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=476.06s)]
*  Maybe it's just like sorry. I just not say the F word or no, it's okay [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=482.58s)]
*  Do you make sure people still vote for me if I too many f-bombs? I'm gonna lose too many votes [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=486.14s)]
*  So I'll try to tone it down. Okay [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=489.78s)]
*  Yeah, if you say more than seven or eight, I'll tap you on the shoulder. Thank you. Yeah [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=492.18s)]
*  Dude, oh, I actually my ribs dude. I've been on a [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=497.86s)]

*  I'll tell you that [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=558.88s)]
*  Because that anyway my ribs I've been having to ice some dude. It's been oh really it's been like actually cracked a rib [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=560.4s)]
*  I mean, it's so it sucks, but it was awesome [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=565.92s)]
*  But it's like yeah the pain you go through to be associated. Yeah, you know look my mice so [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=568.52s)]
*  Like I've only been to the game in Ann Arbor once and you know, Ohio State fans again [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=576.24s)]
*  Oh, we're going up in that territory people throwing beer bottles at us sometimes full beer cans at us [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=581.94s)]
*  I had some kid run up [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=587.58s)]
*  He was like a 19 year old kid run up from behind me and it had been raining a lot that day and he had like [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=589.34s)]
*  Like he'd taken a chunk of mud out of the ground and shoved it in my mouth [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=595.3800000000001s)]
*  I mean this again, this is like what these sports rival years are built around is moments like this, but [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=599.6600000000001s)]
*  We had I guess won four years in a row reforestation is [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=606.46s)]
*  But man we won four years in a row and this this girl she's like, you know 22 years old [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=612.6600000000001s)]
*  She gets in my buddy's face and she said this is my senior year [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=618.96s)]
*  You ruined my college career because you guys beat us four years in a row [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=622.7s)]
*  And then she takes a swing at him and a cop tackles this 22 year old girl down the bleachers [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=627.2600000000001s)]
*  Yeah, and I'm just you know, like man again. Yeah, we've been injured people injured and waiting events. It's crazy [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=633.2800000000001s)]
*  Oh, yeah, I thought that for a second of you were describing a wedding in Appalachia [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=639.5s)]
*  We've had we've had we've had we've had some of those [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=645.34s)]
*  We had Billy strings and he's a guy who does a lot of [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=651.98s)]
*  Picking he does like a lot of guitar picking stuff. Okay. He talked a lot about his environment where he grew up [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=655.62s)]
*  He grew up in like his area had a lot of addiction and stuff like that. What part of West Virginia easy from? [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=661.02s)]
*  but um, oh [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=666.62s)]
*  This guy is your lancing Michigan, but he grew up I grew up in Kentucky [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=668.0999999999999s)]
*  I'm ruined well, but a lot of people this is like the story of my life a lot of people from Michigan, Ohio [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=673.06s)]
*  Pennsylvania their families are all from West Virginia East Kentucky to East Tennessee and then they moved up for the factory jobs [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=678.8199999999999s)]
*  Oh, yeah [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=685.28s)]
*  like there's a really cool song by Dwight Yocum called a read and write and route 23 and it's like in some ways it's [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=686.0999999999999s)]
*  Like the story of my family. Hmm because he came from like two counties over [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=692.9s)]
*  he moved to central Ohio instead of southern Ohio, but [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=697.18s)]
*  I mean, it's like millions of people the massive massive thing [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=700.66s)]
*  So I wouldn't be surprised even that guy's from Michigan if he's got like West Virginia family. I don't know that guy though [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=703.6999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, Billy strings. He's great. He's a new guy too, and he'll take you fishing if you want to go but he um [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=708.38s)]
*  He just has a fascinating story just like growing up and what his life was like [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=714.54s)]
*  and playing music through it all and learning music and [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=719.42s)]
*  How that kind of kept him going and kept him gave him something to do really [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=722.7800000000001s)]
*  Yeah, why was that migration? Why did people migrate from there to? [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=727.38s)]
*  Yeah, it was it was I mean at least the biggest thing is you think about it. So World War two ends, right? [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=732.0600000000001s)]
*  America's the biggest industrial power in the world and a lot of these factories are coming online [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=738.5s)]
*  Close to where they had you know access to waterways because you got to ship iron ore and coal and all that stuff [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=743.7800000000001s)]
*  So a lot of stuff around the Great Lakes, that's Michigan, Ohio [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=749.86s)]
*  You know a lot of coal in Pennsylvania [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=754.22s)]
*  and so you had all these steel mills and you know textile factories and you know [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=756.0600000000001s)]
*  like automobile plants of course in Michigan and all this stuff is getting built and then [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=762.42s)]
*  It's actually what's interesting about it is you had a lot of black people come from the deep south and [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=767.38s)]
*  Then a lot of primarily white people come from Appalachia and they sort of move migrated together to all these factories [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=772.78s)]
*  and like you know, there are books written in Detroit about you know, the [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=779.94s)]
*  You've got like basically the hillbillies from Appalachia the black people from the deep south [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=784.34s)]
*  They're just kind of like tossed into Detroit and like a lot of what we think of a sort of modern [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=790.14s)]
*  Detroit culture is like the fusion of those two groups of people who just dropped in in massive massive numbers and [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=795.86s)]
*  It's like one of the stories of like why Chicago is such a big blues town [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=803.02s)]
*  Because all the black folks from the deep south were moving in and they were you know, bringing their music with them [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=806.5400000000001s)]
*  Yeah, that's why Chicago became such a capital for blues is it's not really like it's because all those folks who came from the Delta [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=811.14s)]
*  So it's it's it's but basically jobs man. I mean there wasn't my mamma talked about this. That's what I called my grandmother [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=817.98s)]
*  She talked a lot about how if you were growing up in Eastern Kentucky in the 30s and 40s [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=824.38s)]
*  It was like basically you go work in the mines or get out like that was all there was at that time [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=829.34s)]
*  And so my grandfather went and worked at a steel mill, you know built a built a pretty good life was a Union welder for [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=835.46s)]
*  40 years and then oh, yeah, we just had a union president on oh, yeah, I listen that one. I like that guy [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=841.82s)]
*  Yeah, why he is wild? He's I mean, it's funny man. You can tell he's from Boston. He's got that thick Boston accent. Yeah [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=848.46s)]
*  But he's a he's a he's a cool dude [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=856.38s)]
*  I actually I've talked to Sean a couple times and you know, it's like normally and you know [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=858.5400000000001s)]
*  It's like normally Democrats are considered sort of the pro-union and then you know [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=863.96s)]
*  30 years ago Republicans were the anti-union and you know [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=867.88s)]
*  one of the things I've been I've been talking a lot about people like Sean is [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=870.76s)]
*  You know a lot of union members are coming over to the Republican side [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=874.44s)]
*  And I think the Republican Party we got to do, you know, frankly a better job at kind of welcoming people [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=877.88s)]
*  But I think Trump is doing a really good job of making union voters feel at home in our coalition [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=883.08s)]
*  Which is like an interesting part of what you know what we're all about [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=888.94s)]
*  I mean, I think it's a Sean said had a teamsters [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=891.56s)]
*  I think yeah, and there was some poll they did just of teamsters members where it's like [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=893.9599999999999s)]
*  65% of teamsters in Pennsylvania are gonna vote for Trump. That's a crazy turnaround from even 15 years [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=899.52s)]
*  Yeah, they couldn't endorse usually they there's only been two times where they haven't endorsed a candidate in the past 30 years [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=905.3199999999999s)]
*  I think or maybe past 50 years. Yeah, but um, but this would be one of those times [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=911.0799999999999s)]
*  They said I think because it's just it's too split. Yeah [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=915.92s)]
*  So do you have to ask Trump places you can go to promote or to [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=919.12s)]
*  Campaign, what does that relation? How does that work? Yeah, no, it's it's it's actually mostly driven at like this the staff level, right? [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=925.76s)]
*  And so a strategy kind of yeah, it's like strategy. So so okay. There are seven big battleground states [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=933.2s)]
*  It's the three in the Midwest or Michigan, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=939.48s)]
*  And then Georgia, Arizona, Nevada and North Carolina and so it's like you look at [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=942.92s)]
*  a little bit it's driven by polling a little bit it's driven on just like where do you think this guy's gonna do the [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=949.0s)]
*  best and [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=953.64s)]
*  I've spent a ton of my time like I think I did like six or five or six events just in Pennsylvania the past [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=954.96s)]
*  Week and a half Wow [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=960.92s)]
*  So I was in a lot of time Pennsylvania a lot of time Michigan a lot of time in [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=962.16s)]
*  Wisconsin I'm actually trying to get kid rock to get with me in Michigan in a couple days. Yeah, he's a Michigan guy [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=965.72s)]
*  Oh, he'll go. Yeah, I'd be probably will [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=970.18s)]
*  Yeah, he texted me last night I mean [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=974.36s)]
*  You know, you can't see but my cousin for those of you who are watching my cousin's here [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=977.32s)]
*  She's more like my big sister [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=981.08s)]
*  But like we're hanging out. I went to a wedding last night. Oh nice. My little cousin got married and [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=983.1600000000001s)]
*  Kid Rock sends me a text message like hey if you're in Nashville because I think I guess he knew I was doing this [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=989.72s)]
*  Well, some people were going over there. What do you mind? I was talking he's like, hey, we're going over to Bob's and I was like [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=994.22s)]
*  I got to prepare for this podcast tomorrow [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=999.2s)]
*  Vance is coming on. Yeah [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=1002.52s)]
*  Maybe that's how he knew cuz he texted me and I was like, oh man [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=1004.56s)]
*  I want to fly to Nashville right now just so I can party with kid rock, right? I mean like that's a that's a [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=1007.16s)]
*  experience of a lifetime [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=1012.52s)]
*  So so now I'm trying to get him to go to Michigan with me, but I'm sure you probably would man. Oh, yeah, dude [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=1014.4399999999999s)]
*  He's if he's one of a kind man. Yeah, but he would answer your question [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=1019.64s)]
*  It's basically you go where the campaign needs you to go right and and like yeah, I could say no [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=1023.68s)]
*  But I'm like running for vice president [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=1028.8s)]
*  So I try to do as much as I can just to be helpful and do y'all have do you go with Donald Trump? [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=1030.92s)]
*  You guys go separately a lot of times. Do you guys have like strategy talks in the mornings and stuff? [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=1035.96s)]
*  Like is it what is it like? Yeah, it's it's more like doubles tennis kind of yeah [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=1041.0s)]
*  It's more divide and conquer right? So it's like you got two people and you can be in two places [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=1045.92s)]
*  So you might as well do it [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=1052.1200000000001s)]
*  But if we got a really big event like, you know, the president got shot in in Bucks County or sorry [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=1053.2s)]
*  About the first time okay first time [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=1058.56s)]
*  He got shot in in in Pennsylvania and so we went out to [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=1063.36s)]
*  Pennsylvania together to do the big rally and then Elon. Oh, it's there in butler PA. Yes in Butler, Pennsylvania [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=1070.0s)]
*  And then you know, like I was in Bucks County, Pennsylvania like a week earlier, but that was just me right, right [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=1076.4s)]
*  So you sort of go, you know some places you go together [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=1082.16s)]
*  But most of the time we're sort of dividing and conquering how um with the attempts that they've had on Trump's on Trump's life and safety [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=1084.08s)]
*  How much of a concern has that been for you? [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=1093.0s)]
*  Like it's like cuz if I'm standing next to a guy and they're shooting at him. I'm next to him. Yeah, you know [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=1096.52s)]
*  Yeah, I know what you mean. I mean I try not to think about it man because really yeah [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=1102.9199999999998s)]
*  It's it's just it's one of these things you can't control and if you're gonna do this job [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=1107.6399999999999s)]
*  Like you gotta go out and talk to a lot of people when you gotta go try to win, right? [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=1111.8s)]
*  I mean, right like I fundamentally believe that we're trying to win to help the country [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=1115.48s)]
*  So either you you know, you either do it or you don't do it [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=1119.1599999999999s)]
*  And if you do it you just kind of kind of accept it [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=1123.36s)]
*  I mean, I don't think there's I don't know. Maybe I'm just this is just me rationalizing it [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=1125.6399999999999s)]
*  I don't feel like there's that big of a target on my back [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=1129.68s)]
*  But who the hell knows where you're tall are you like are you a little taller than him or not? Yep [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=1131.86s)]

*  The weird shit people say about you on the internet like the thing there was a long time [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=1138.12s)]
*  Maybe even still today if you Google how tall is JD Vance it would say five foot seven [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=1142.24s)]
*  And I said six [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=1148.1999999999998s)]
*  Somebody updated it. Yeah [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=1151.1999999999998s)]
*  Okay, the first headline is JD Vance is tall but Americans are getting shorter. What the hell is the Internet's a weird? [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=1153.24s)]
*  It also says Joe Biden is six foot sleep. I don't know if that's a height [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=1158.6s)]
*  Well, see this is the thing though [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=1163.4399999999998s)]
*  How tall is JD Vance we felt there was like a conspiracy on the internet that I was a really short guy [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=1164.96s)]
*  But yeah, no, I'm sick. I'm about six two. I think yeah once you get better people help and you get you high [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=1168.96s)]
*  You get you get a pretty tall. You know, I'm six feet tall. Yeah, I'm sick. You told this rib gets back in place [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=1173.76s)]

*  Because I'm trying to think of other jobs where you get shot at really military [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=1191.58s)]
*  Domestic violence I guess and then [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=1198.02s)]
*  politician politician, I mean normally politicians don't get shot at that much but apparently [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=1200.94s)]
*  Apparently it's coming back man. That's not that's not like a good thing to come back to you know [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=1205.42s)]
*  What I mean, yeah, but I also mean it's it's I definitely grew up [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=1209.22s)]
*  Like and I grew up in Ohio, but I spent a lot of time in East Kentucky [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=1212.5s)]

*  There's no way mom's gonna be around to meet like if I have kids [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=1359.9199999999998s)]

*  You know see that you'd be frustrated with her one moment and then just desperate for to get better the next moment [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=1399.12s)]
*  You're constantly bouncing back and forth. But man, it's it's amazing. It really is. I mean, she was at the wedding [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=1403.76s)]

*  That a lot of people would have that second chance, but you know, you fall off the wagon once 15 years ago [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=1596.54s)]
*  It's like oh that sucks. I'm gonna climb back on today. You fall off that wagon. It might it might kill you [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=1602.6200000000001s)]
*  Yeah, and I really worry about that because I think a lot of a lot of good people, you know [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=1608.62s)]
*  Like mom it didn't happen like once right? It's not like she got clean and sober and that was it [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=1612.26s)]
*  I just lost a few times. Yeah, it's back on. It's a process man [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=1616.4599999999998s)]
*  Yeah, I've had relapses over the years and had to get back on and it's it's tough [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=1620.5s)]
*  and one of the tougher things to do is to get back on but it's funny because I think if I [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=1624.1s)]
*  If I don't know if I'd be sober if [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=1630.5s)]
*  This stuff weren't killing people to be honest with you. I know that's sad to say [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=1633.86s)]
*  But that keeps me out of the risk of it, you know, it just makes it too makes a little scarier [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=1637.78s)]
*  Yeah, that's the thing. It makes it scarier. Yeah, but it's also sad that somebody I mean, this is ridiculous to say probably that somebody can't [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=1642.34s)]
*  You know, you can't even do cocaine in this country anymore, you know [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=1650.74s)]
*  And that seemed like a crazy thing to say and [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=1654.98s)]
*  Don't say it don't say that us but I said it but but yeah, but don't say that anymore [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=1658.3799999999999s)]
*  I'm gonna steal that line [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=1663.1799999999998s)]
*  after the election though and I [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=1665.22s)]
*  First it's I'm fortunate [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=1668.3s)]
*  To be clear those watching I've never done cocaine before. Yeah, and nobody made many mistakes, but not that one nobody's yeah, but it's just [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=1671.06s)]
*  It's unfortunate. That's that [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=1678.06s)]
*  It's um, I don't even know what you mean. It's unfortunate that like look like everybody makes mistakes [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=1680.82s)]
*  Right everybody makes mistakes, right and like I'm not I know as a buddy of mine told me about this [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=1687.78s)]
*  This is hell. This has got to have been [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=1694.4599999999998s)]
*  Three years ago [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=1697.86s)]
*  It's been a while. But basically what happened is [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=1699.62s)]
*  his daughter was like a bridesmaid in a wedding and [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=1703.26s)]
*  they're on this wedding and [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=1707.54s)]
*  like the wedding got canceled because a couple of the groomsmen like had terrible overdoses the night before at the bachelor party because they [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=1710.3799999999999s)]
*  Took something like, you know, you can judge and say all they shouldn't have been taking something [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=1718.6s)]
*  But everybody takes something at some point in their lives. Like we don't want it to kill people [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=1722.34s)]
*  We don't want stupid mistakes to kill people that's that's sort of like right that's live and learn live and learn from stupid mistakes [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=1726.7s)]
*  Right you should be able to live and learn. Yes now it becomes a death sentence [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=1732.16s)]
*  That's what's really I think changed about from now to when my [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=1735.3400000000001s)]
*  My mom was struggling with addiction. Why do why is it so bad? [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=1739.8600000000001s)]
*  Do you like what do you know a lot about the fentanyl crisis? I mean I know a fair amount about it [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=1743.1200000000001s)]
*  You know, I've I've I've worried about it for a long time. I've I've you know worked on bills related to it [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=1748.0800000000002s)]
*  I mean there there are two basic issues, right and [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=1753.5s)]
*  It's like, you know any business there's a manufacturer. There's a wholesaler and then there's the retail right and [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=1756.7s)]
*  You know with with fentanyl it's it's not you can't like make fentanyl in a trailer in somebody's basement [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=1763.66s)]
*  But that's like it's like meth it takes a really complicated pretty sophisticated pharmaceutical process [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=1770.54s)]
*  So we know that a lot of it maybe even most of it the Chinese are making meaning Chinese companies not like necessarily the Chinese government [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=1775.78s)]
*  But they sure as hell know about it and then they bring it in primarily through the southern border and the Mexican drug cartels [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=1782.32s)]
*  Are like the wholesalers right of the Chinese? [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=1790.26s)]
*  farmers the [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=1793.96s)]
*  manufacturer the drug cartels are bringing in wholesale style cause then it makes in the street level Wow and [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=1795.1399999999999s)]
*  I mean, it's really crazy man [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=1801.3999999999999s)]
*  Like I was talking to a DEA agent about this a couple years ago, and I think this was in this was in 2022 [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=1803.12s)]
*  He was like look a few years ago the cartels were making less than a billion dollars a year [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=1808.98s)]
*  And he's like in 22 23. We think they'll make 14 billion dollars a year. So like an [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=1815.3s)]
*  explosion of drug trafficking in this country and you hear about stories [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=1821.38s)]
*  I don't think it happens that much. Thank God, but somebody smokes a joint. It's laced with fentanyl. They go into a coma [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=1826.14s)]
*  Yeah, I mean I have seven friends that about that. Um, I have seven friends and not even just like a strange people [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=1831.74s)]
*  You know like but not all best friends sure [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=1838.6s)]
*  But I have seven friends at that overdose and died from fentanyl. Yeah. Yeah, that's me, right? [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=1842.12s)]
*  And it had yeah and it happened with harder stuff [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=1848.56s)]
*  It happens a lot like I think with you know, you hear about it being laced in marijuana, but like not that much [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=1850.8s)]
*  Yeah, but me you're pointing about cocaine [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=1856.4599999999998s)]
*  Pills like you have to be careful. Well, it's seriously it's a huge thing [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=1859.04s)]
*  Unbelievable crisis and it's like yeah, you'd think that we I don't know how you fight something like that [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=1864.3200000000002s)]
*  maybe we need to have like a like a [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=1870.0800000000002s)]
*  Head of like the DEA or something on maybe he would be able to help or she would be able to help us figure [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=1872.3600000000001s)]
*  That out a little bit. I think I'd be that'd be very interesting conversation [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=1877.8400000000001s)]
*  But I think I think you've got a I think you got to go to it at the heart and something [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=1880.52s)]
*  You know Trump did towards the end of his administration doesn't get a whole lot of headlines. Obviously, I'm biased [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=1885.16s)]
*  I think it should get headlines as he was using [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=1889.88s)]
*  Economic leverage to try to convince the Chinese to crack down on fentanyl manufacturing because if you get it at the source, right? [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=1893.16s)]
*  That's I think really the way to address it. Oh, there's fentanyl and half the bookshelves. They make over there, dude [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=1899.88s)]
*  Dictionaries and that bitch will give that bitch will give way [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=1907.76s)]

*  Making it easier for these this like massive criminal [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=2184.8599999999997s)]
*  Organizations to get richer and richer and richer like we should be trying to make them poor and I mean, you know [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=2189.02s)]
*  Yeah, help people actually need it. Well, it's also it's obviously one of the biggest enemies [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=2195.18s)]
*  That's right. It's like if there were an enemy that we're killing [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=2199.66s)]
*  If somebody if there were somebody shooting in your country every day and killing people [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=2204.8199999999997s)]
*  Yeah at a certain point you go over there and you send your military there or do something to say hey [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=2209.8599999999997s)]
*  That's right. You're not gonna be you we're not gonna let you do this anymore. Yeah, that's basically what's happening [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=2215.62s)]
*  That's right. I mean, can you can you imagine if if if Mexico sent? [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=2220.14s)]
*  Gunmen across the border and killed 70,000 Americans a year because that's about what dies from fentanyl [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=2225.06s)]
*  We would be in a major war. Yeah, right what you know, we just absolutely would be the case [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=2230.02s)]
*  So the other thing is crazy about this is so these cartels and you see this graphic up is pretty pretty interesting there [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=2235.14s)]
*  But the cartels are gonna start to destabilize the country of Mexico [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=2241.14s)]
*  Like do you know do you this named Pablo Escobar? Yeah, okay [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=2246.14s)]
*  So like that the the Colombian cartels in the 70s were as powerful as like the Colombian government, right? [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=2251.06s)]
*  It was it was a narco state [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=2257.5s)]
*  You don't want that to happen at like right at the American southern border where the drug cartels have more power than the Mexican government [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=2258.66s)]
*  Yeah, that's just gonna be chaotic. It's gonna be basically a warlike atmosphere on our southern border. That's bad news [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=2265.14s)]
*  Well, it's bad news, but it'd be great to figure out a way that to to shut it down [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=2271.3s)]
*  I mean it just feels like yeah [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=2275.26s)]
*  If that many people are dying each year if it were actual people shooting at these people [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=2276.42s)]
*  Yeah, we would send people there in a heartbeat, right? [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=2281.1s)]
*  I mean, and I think that's what we have to I think not that we have to send people to to Mexico [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=2283.1s)]
*  But I think that we actually have to have a military response of the southern border a hundred percent because these are such vicious people [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=2288.3s)]
*  And I think local law enforcement they're telling us they're overwhelmed by some of these guys and [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=2295.14s)]
*  We've got to be willing to send our our best people our best fighters to get control of the southern border [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=2300.1800000000003s)]
*  I think that's the most important issue confronting the country because look I mean, how do you even measure? [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=2305.1s)]
*  the human cost of [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=2310.62s)]
*  70,000 people many of them in the prime of their life and the ripple effect of it too in their families the orphans [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=2313.42s)]
*  Yeah, the parents that are heartbroken. I mean how many kids are like this is my story, right? [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=2319.38s)]
*  That's why my grandmother raised me is because my mom struggled with addiction. Luckily. My mom got clean [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=2324.1s)]
*  You've got hundreds of thousands of children who are being raised by their grandparents or their aunts and uncles [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=2328.7799999999997s)]
*  Like that is an unspeakable [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=2333.66s)]
*  Human tragedy man, especially when we can do better we could do so much better and we're failing right now [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=2335.98s)]
*  And that's you know, the one one of the reasons why I'm here one of the reasons why I'm running. Yeah [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=2340.74s)]
*  What what what was it like growing up like with an alcoholic mother like and no judgment against your mother [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=2346.58s)]
*  This is just to look at it, right? Yeah, sure. I appreciate that. Yeah, what? [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=2351.46s)]
*  What is that like? Like is it hard to make a connection with your mom? [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=2355.94s)]
*  Like what are some of the side effects of that on a child? Yeah, I mean, I definitely think there's a [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=2359.26s)]
*  You get very careful about who you allow yourself to get close to right that's what that's one big part of it [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=2367.1800000000003s)]
*  You're never quite sure whether you can trust [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=2372.1400000000003s)]
*  The particular situation that you're in, right? [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=2374.86s)]
*  So am I still gonna be living in this house three months from now [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=2377.26s)]
*  If I have somebody if I give somebody my address because it's back in the 90s, right? [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=2379.82s)]
*  People still wrote letters postcards things like that [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=2383.38s)]
*  At least a lot more than they do today if I give somebody my address [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=2385.78s)]
*  Are they gonna send me a letter and I'm not even live in this place anymore because we you know [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=2389.26s)]
*  We moved around a fair amount right, but I think I [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=2393.2200000000003s)]
*  Think that you know, the the thing that it I took away from it is I [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=2397.78s)]
*  Very even as a young kid. I sort of very neatly divided the world into like three categories of people, right? [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=2402.7000000000003s)]
*  There were the helpless people the victims the people who needed to be helped [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=2409.0800000000004s)]
*  There were the bad guys who were preying on the victims and then there were the strong people who sort of stood up [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=2412.6600000000003s)]
*  For for everybody else and stood up to the bad guys. That's like, you know, that's overly simplistic [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=2418.7s)]
*  But definitely, you know, I saw my mom [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=2425.9s)]
*  growing up very much as this person who was who was kind of a victim and [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=2429.86s)]
*  Was being preyed on by by bad people, right? [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=2434.82s)]
*  and then the person who was sort of looking up for us and standing up for me especially was my grandmother and [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=2437.78s)]
*  I think that that that attitude of [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=2443.5s)]
*  You know, some people are just not as strong as we wish them to be mm-hmm and bad people are gonna prey on them [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=2446.3799999999997s)]
*  But it's kind of up to you know [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=2453.66s)]
*  You try to make yourself the person who can look out for people who can protect people and that's always what I wanted to be [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=2455.54s)]
*  That's one thing. I think I took from it able to be that for your mom. Did you feel like you know, not always certainly [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=2462.54s)]
*  I mean when I was a lot of responsibility for a kid when I was a teenager, man [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=2468.48s)]
*  I was definitely very very selfish thing. I got pretty resentful [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=2472.24s)]
*  Situations like all other people have more money than I do other people have more stability than I do [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=2476.06s)]
*  You know other people, you know, they've got nice cars. We don't have that [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=2479.98s)]
*  so there's definitely like there's definitely like a resentment that comes from it, I think but [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=2484.1s)]
*  You know, I left high school and listed in the Marine Corps [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=2490.1s)]
*  Spent four years in the Marine Corps. I think that what you know that really did for me was just like gave me a [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=2493.3799999999997s)]
*  cool perspective and [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=2499.3399999999997s)]
*  I probably went into the Marine Corps. I was pretty whiny pretty resentful kid [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=2501.74s)]
*  Was pissed off at my mom was pissed off at all these other people because I didn't have the things that I thought I should [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=2505.3s)]
*  Have and then eventually yeah, there's me when I was much much skinnier much better looking. Yeah [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=2509.82s)]
*  Marines you that was the original ozempic [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=2515.46s)]
*  That's frozen that is good that is good Marines the original ozempic I'm gonna steal that one [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=2520.6600000000003s)]
*  But man [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=2527.34s)]
*  Yeah, I know I say this all the time dude [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=2528.98s)]
*  If I went back to boot camp for two months boot camps three months [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=2530.78s)]
*  I went back to boot camp for two months. I'd come out with a six-pack. Yeah [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=2533.42s)]
*  But but you know, I've anyway so simple fat [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=2536.94s)]
*  And I don't know if you can even joke about simplify and I'm no offense any Marines I law no [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=2544.94s)]
*  I'm sure no Marines took offense to see that. Yeah [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=2550.1800000000003s)]
*  We've done a lot of shows on military bases and stuff and yeah [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=2553.1800000000003s)]
*  Yeah, it's usually the army's just waiting for the Marines to get there to tell them what to do. Yeah, that's right. That's right [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=2556.3s)]
*  I know the chain of man, but yeah, anyway, so we we we had a [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=2561.7s)]
*  Yeah, I think that the way that I noticed it [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=2566.58s)]
*  I mean not to get too personal but like when I [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=2569.98s)]
*  saw I met my wife in law school and it was like, you know, I [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=2573.2599999999998s)]
*  Dated girls in the past but for her it was like, oh my god [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=2579.14s)]
*  This is I'm in love with this girl, right? Like I'd known her for a week and I was like I want to marry this girl [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=2582.1s)]
*  yeah, and [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=2587.9399999999996s)]
*  There was definitely just an element of like [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=2589.66s)]
*  It took a long time for me to get to a place where I was like, oh I can actually trust this person [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=2592.5s)]
*  I actually rely on this person [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=2598.02s)]
*  Because that's not really the experience that I had growing up is the people you trusted on trusted the people you relied on [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=2599.46s)]
*  They would just kind of disappear. Yeah, sometimes through no fault of their own, but sometimes they would just disappear and so [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=2604.46s)]
*  You know, I don't know if you've said attachment issues and that's that's something that definitely I think comes from growing up in a pretty tough [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=2610.92s)]
*  Pretty chaotic environment, but you know the other thing the flip side of it is and again [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=2618.42s)]
*  This is this is why I talk about the Marine Corps is you have for four years in the Marine Corps [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=2623.5s)]
*  You know like like one of the best Marines [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=2627.2200000000003s)]
*  Maybe the best Marine that I served with is this kid who grew up. He was a Puerto Rican guy from the Bronx [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=2629.26s)]
*  Was a drug dealer or jewelry or not D. We're jewelry [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=2634.3s)]
*  I mean not with uniform, right? Okay, that's yeah, maybe he did but by the time he you know, by the time I met him [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=2638.42s)]
*  as a Marine, yeah, he did [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=2644.5s)]
*  But but he was like he had had a much harder life than I had and there was no bullshit [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=2646.34s)]
*  There was no complaining no whining. He was just doing his job [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=2651.82s)]
*  And he was a good dude and you meet a lot of people like that and you start to realize [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=2654.9s)]
*  Like in some ways, you know not having everything handed to you is actually a blessing [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=2659.7400000000002s)]
*  Right and and and growing up in a tough circumstance and be able to understand that not everybody's always had it easy. I used to be [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=2663.7400000000002s)]
*  Annoyed by that kind of complaining about it saying now I sort of see it as like a good thing [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=2671.58s)]
*  Yeah, right because I think I have a different perspective than than a lot of people I spend my life around where you know [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=2676.62s)]
*  They they were born to a rich family. They went to a private school then that you know [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=2682.22s)]
*  Everything was kind of laid out for him. Oh, it's kind of good to not have everything laid out for you [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=2686.14s)]
*  He's have to work for it a little bit more [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=2690.02s)]
*  Yeah, that was gonna be my next my my follow-up question that was just like yeah [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=2691.2599999999998s)]
*  What are the what are the positives like and also so we don't get stuck in like, you know? [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=2694.8999999999996s)]
*  Just in like a [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=2699.2200000000003s)]
*  Debbie downer spiral kind of you know, because it's okay to talk about stuff [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=2702.1800000000003s)]
*  But sometimes, you know, it's like things can get kind of like where you're just looking at the negative things [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=2706.1400000000003s)]
*  But there's usually something positive and everything exactly right and yeah, that's what I was thinking. What were some of the positives of [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=2710.54s)]
*  Of having a childhood like that and of being yeah, and I guess it would be some self-reliance [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=2717.34s)]
*  I think I think it's definitely some self-reliance [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=2722.46s)]
*  Awareness probably which is probably a curse when you're young because it feels like you have to be kind of scared of stuff [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=2726.1s)]
*  But are but when you get older being having awareness can be pretty helpful sometimes. Yeah, I've got my head on a swivel, right? [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=2731.42s)]
*  I'm always looking around corners [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=2737.54s)]
*  I'm always yeah kind of worried that things that aren't exactly what they seem [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=2738.9s)]
*  But I think that's made me a little less comfortable, which is a good thing [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=2743.06s)]
*  Especially in the in the political life. Oh, yeah [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=2746.42s)]
*  Everybody has everybody in politics has a vice that's much worse than alcoholism is the way that I put it [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=2755.38s)]
*  But we we release the list [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=2760.98s)]
*  Seriously, we need to release the f scene list that that is an important thing [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=2766.14s)]
*  We go down that rabbit hole. But anyway, I guess the other thing that I gained from is, you know, I [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=2770.46s)]
*  I think that I'm just much I see people as people [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=2779.66s)]
*  and [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=2785.14s)]
*  One thing I've picked up on like I went to law school at Yale [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=2785.94s)]
*  And a lot of them a lot of my classmates are good people, but you're a lawyer also [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=2789.18s)]
*  Yeah, but I sort of as soon as I went from law school. I went to the business world [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=2792.86s)]
*  So I never really practiced law. I was mostly a business guy [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=2796.42s)]
*  But like a lot of my friends they they look at people as like where did you go to school? [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=2799.54s)]
*  What are your parents do? Yeah, you know, what job do you have? What credential do you have? I've never had that right? [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=2804.94s)]
*  And so when people like talk about politics or policy and be like, oh well this person has a PhD [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=2812.06s)]
*  I don't give a shit. Yeah, I mean that they may be smart, but I don't care about only three. Yeah, exactly [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=2816.86s)]
*  I don't even I don't care about [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=2823.94s)]
*  the letters [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=2826.14s)]
*  But I but like I meet somebody and oh they don't have a fancy degree or they don't have a fancy job [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=2828.34s)]
*  I I still just naturally care about what they think because the way that I grew up [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=2833.5s)]
*  I just sort of see people as people. Yeah, I think that's a that's just a very [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=2837.3s)]
*  It's a perspective that I'm glad that I have I think it's very much a product of how I grew up [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=2840.86s)]
*  Yeah, I like people that have their own thing [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=2845.94s)]
*  I have like I don't like I don't I don't dislike somebody if they inherited everything. Yeah, but I [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=2848.34s)]
*  Gravitate more towards people that that haven't had that experience I think because [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=2857.78s)]
*  Yeah, I don't know there's just something a little bit more abnormal about it [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=2866.86s)]
*  I don't like it when things were handed to people [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=2869.82s)]
*  I guess maybe real the truth is I got upset when other people had stuff that [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=2871.94s)]
*  Was handed to them which probably was just normal stuff to be handed to a kid [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=2876.54s)]
*  Yeah, or to a to you know, but that made me like off screw that, you know, I'll figure this shit out [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=2880.6000000000004s)]
*  You know I'm saying right damn or whatever. You know what I'm saying? I'll you know, I have that exact attitude [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=2886.94s)]
*  Yeah, what I was like 13 14. Yeah. Yeah, it's something that is it's just that rebellion at that age [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=2891.86s)]
*  What would you say and we have a lot of audience members that [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=2897.82s)]
*  Have struggled with addiction or who and these days everybody's you can't even [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=2902.34s)]
*  Like who doesn't have somebody that's in their family or something struggle with addiction [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=2907.86s)]
*  but what what suggestion or like just advice or thoughts would you give to a [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=2912.46s)]
*  Young person who has a parent who's [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=2919.78s)]
*  Who has alcoholism as to how to navigate that because I even get messages a lot from people [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=2923.46s)]
*  That are like, hey, my dad is struggling or this. What do I do? I don't know what to do here [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=2929.02s)]
*  You know, do you have any thoughts on that and it's not like you're a specialist. Yeah [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=2934.0s)]
*  Yeah, I'm not a specialist. I mean here's here's what I tried to do. I [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=2938.78s)]
*  mean take this for you know for what it's worth, but [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=2943.78s)]
*  number one is [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=2947.2400000000002s)]
*  You gotta if you're a kid in your environment where there's a lot of addiction [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=2949.6s)]
*  You got to make sure that you're taken care of right? [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=2954.3599999999997s)]
*  Like don't don't get yourself in such a situation where it's not just your parent that is struggling [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=2958.2999999999997s)]
*  But it becomes you that's struggling too, right? [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=2963.2599999999998s)]
*  Because you can't help them out. You can't help them out unless you're able to take care of yourself first, right? [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=2965.4799999999996s)]
*  Right. That's that's number one. I think number two is as hard as it is man and shit [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=2970.9599999999996s)]
*  I know this very well because there were times when I had some very angry moments with my mom [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=2976.2799999999997s)]
*  Don't get resentful and try to keep your heart as open as possible [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=2982.04s)]
*  Right. You got to compartmentalize a little bit, right? There's yeah, there's the addict version [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=2986.4399999999996s)]
*  But then there's the version that you know that read you a book when you were a kid or there's a version that took you to [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=2990.72s)]
*  You know your favorite movie or that you try to hold on to the memories [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=2996.04s)]
*  That are completely divorced from the addiction [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=3000.4399999999996s)]
*  Because I think if you allow yourself to become totally resentful then it doesn't just affect them it starts to affect you too, right? [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=3002.88s)]
*  Don't don't allow your parents addiction to become something that destroys your life too [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=3010.56s)]
*  In other words is you've got to kind of you got to kind of keep your soul intact here [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=3014.68s)]
*  I mean I [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=3019.68s)]
*  Just practically go to those in a meetings and I learned more about mom [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=3022.2400000000002s)]
*  Inter addiction going to those in a meetings and I didn't always you know [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=3026.88s)]
*  It's not like it was like some eureka moment [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=3030.12s)]
*  Oh, there's you know, I'm not pissed off at you anymore, right? [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=3032.16s)]
*  But you at least understand it a little bit more and you gain some appreciation for what's going on in their life [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=3034.54s)]
*  Because that's a that's a big part of it. Yeah, and you also [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=3039.48s)]
*  Think about in a meetings is it's just again. It is human nature and all of its splendor its virtue and its vice, man [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=3043.32s)]
*  Oh, yes, I knew a life boat the last one I want you somebody selling a fucking boat [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=3051.2400000000002s)]
*  Exactly like you can't do we're trying to get off [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=3056.12s)]
*  And yeah, and some guys started bidding on the bottom like in they had made him take it outside [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=3060.6800000000003s)]
*  Yeah, because it's outside issues or whatever, but it was like what is even happening here, dude [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=3064.6s)]
*  I wasn't in a meeting some guy had a fish hook stuck in his frickin cheek. Really? Yeah Wow [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=3069.2400000000002s)]
*  Man good either buddy had two weeks clean. Yeah, he'd either had a really bad night or really good [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=3076.12s)]
*  Catch him release brother catch him release. He probably tried to come across the border [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=3090.7200000000003s)]
*  And I only say that cuz we had a couple border patrol agents on here and so we've learned a good bit about it [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=3098.8s)]
*  Yeah, no, I had a border patrol agent who's clearly before you go [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=3103.32s)]
*  But I just that that that statement about trying not to be resentful against your parent because yeah [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=3109.0s)]
*  That resentment is the seed that can lead you down some of this or activate some of the same behaviors in you [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=3115.2s)]
*  it's not and I'm not preaching that but it can activate a lot of a [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=3122.2s)]
*  Resentment is just it's an evil seed. No, that's right. It's so many bad things can happen there because it's just that's an important [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=3128.08s)]
*  That's right. I never thought of that or heard it before well in what you said earlier about not getting into a negative spiral [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=3133.64s)]
*  I think is really important. Just just psychologically. Hey look, man [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=3138.88s)]
*  I know you had a tough life in a lot of ways [[00:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=3142.64s)]
*  There are certainly some moments in my life that were pretty tough, but I've never [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=3145.6s)]
*  Again, I'm not an expert. I've you know, I've read some books on this stuff. This is not JD Vance's expert opinion [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=3151.0s)]
*  This is just a guy talking is I really worry that a lot of the mental health stuff in [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=3157.0s)]
*  2024 is [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=3163.2s)]
*  about like [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=3165.24s)]
*  Focusing so much on what's bad in your life that you end up wallowing in it and it becomes a sort of self-reinforcing spiral [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=3167.04s)]
*  Like there's only so much you can I mean if bad shit has happened to you [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=3175.08s)]
*  There's only so much you can do to think about it and process it and you know [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=3178.92s)]
*  Sometimes bad shit happens because it just happens right now. There's no like rationalizing. There's no like thinking through it and [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=3183.46s)]
*  And and you know what? [[00:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=3190.44s)]
*  Like is most helpful is getting outside and going for a walk like that made me feel way better [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=3192.6s)]
*  Than trying to understand why did mom do this thing when she was 13 or when I was 13 years old and she was you know [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=3199.36s)]
*  I guess 39 [[00:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=3205.88s)]
*  36 would have been when I was 13, but like why? [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=3208.6s)]
*  Right still harping on it. Yeah, you gotta go. Yeah walks then I mean I go for him, but still [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=3213.0s)]
*  Sometimes you got some ghosts man, but I [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=3218.24s)]
*  Longer you sit there and look for ghosts all you it's still go [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=3222.56s)]
*  He's still ago, and it's almost like you find more ghosts right and you keep on finding them [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=3225.72s)]
*  And then it's like alright, man [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=3229.92s)]
*  I just feel like hanging out my buddies go for a walk and have a drink well [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=3231.24s)]
*  you know it not if you're dealing with addiction, but [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=3234.92s)]
*  like have a drink of coffee just like go you know go hang out because I really worry that like [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=3238.52s)]
*  The constant wallowing is bad for us. Yeah, we've gotten into this definitely no constant into a heavy self-help [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=3245.08s)]
*  Type of vibe yeah, you know like every book is a self-help book because self-help is great [[00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=3251.68s)]
*  But also you're saying the other side of that is that you're saying that something's wrong with me [[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=3256.48s)]
*  Right and so if you're always looking for ways to improve yourself, which it can be positive to do that [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=3261.16s)]
*  Yeah, I've noticed in my own life. It's also a way where you're also [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=3266.88s)]
*  Kind of saying there's always something wrong with you. That's interesting so I'm in the same way that I'm always trying to get better [[00:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=3271.2799999999997s)]
*  It's like I'm there [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=3277.96s)]
*  I've obviously created then I'm [[00:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=3279.96s)]
*  There's something unachievable. Yeah, because I'm always trying to get better. It's upset this impossible course [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=3282.6s)]
*  So really I'm part of me is telling me. Oh, there's something wrong with you [[00:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=3287.64s)]
*  So it becomes a little bit more about finding ways to accept myself [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=3290.76s)]
*  Yeah, you're gonna balance it right you gotta balance like obviously there's all things we can work on [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=3293.7200000000003s)]
*  But you know it can become a self-defeating cycle of people yeah, and I try to I try to just balance [[00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=3297.96s)]

*  Yourself, and that's what I've tried to do is you know just balance the good and the bad. Yeah. Yeah, why is balance man? [[00:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=3409.26s)]
*  It's a good point. Yeah, things aren't gonna be exactly yeah things aren't gonna be perfect. You know yeah [[00:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=3415.2200000000003s)]
*  I always was like I always yeah, I created when I was a kid like I have to be perfect and to be like [[00:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=3421.02s)]
*  Accepted or whatever you know yeah, that was like a that was like a way that I created in my life [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=3426.9s)]
*  I think yeah, I got one what did that look to give me like what would you try to be perfect at? [[00:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=3431.94s)]
*  Like school or work or or just like you know in shape or like what like what like what's your if you're trying to get? [[00:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=3437.26s)]
*  Perfect. What are you trying to get perfect? Well? That's the crazy part is it was almost this blind thing [[00:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=3445.02s)]
*  I never even asked the question. Hey, what am I trying to be perfect? That's interesting. It was just this like [[00:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=3449.54s)]
*  you [[00:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=3454.94s)]
*  like the only way you're gonna be [[00:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=3456.5s)]
*  Seen you have to do everything perfect. You know yeah, and then you'll get the you'll I [[00:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=3459.14s)]
*  Don't know it's just this missing thing inside of myself. I don't know what you mean [[00:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=3465.1s)]
*  I wanted to be seen so it was like you have to do it perfect [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=3468.2599999999998s)]
*  Yeah, right if you because if you do it perfect, then there would be no way it wouldn't mathematically make sense [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=3470.62s)]
*  That you wouldn't be seen then sure because that [[00:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=3477.22s)]
*  Would have to be seen yeah, right nobody would not see something that was done perfectly [[00:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=3481.46s)]
*  But but perfection was is impossible and so it was always I'd always set myself up for this like [[00:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=3486.74s)]
*  You'd always come up short no matter what it was and it could be in anything something [[00:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=3494.54s)]
*  I was presenting at school the way I was the way I looked while you were talking to me [[00:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=3498.2599999999998s)]
*  It just everything had to be like this so it was this constant like [[00:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=3502.14s)]
*  I just never let my breath go you know yeah, and um and [[00:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=3505.9s)]
*  And then I was always falling short and so then I can be a tough way to live [[00:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=3511.3s)]
*  Yeah, oh it's horrible, and it fulfilled this prophecy in my head [[00:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=3515.98s)]
*  Oh, we fell short you're not enough which which is what you thought in the beginning anyway, right? [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=3518.6600000000003s)]
*  And I'm not saying that now like now [[00:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=3523.34s)]
*  I have different thoughts and feelings, but those were things that I now I'm able to look back and see oh that that's how [[00:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=3525.1s)]
*  I was operating yeah, and just how even when I talk about it [[00:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=3530.3s)]
*  It sounds fucking impossibly stressful. Yeah, yeah, it does [[00:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=3534.2s)]
*  Did you ever go to ACA meetings or anything like that? [[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=3538.56s)]
*  ACA meetings like adult children of alcohol did you ever go to no no I guess it's interesting no I never did [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=3541.7999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, some people don't need it. Yeah, I mean I think frankly probably would have helped me [[00:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=3547.7599999999998s)]
*  Would have been useful to go to we did sometimes like there was one very long-term treatment facility that mom went to and [[00:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=3552.16s)]
*  I guess it was kind of like that because part of that was that we would go to [[00:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=3560.08s)]
*  Meetings every couple of weeks with all the kids of the people who were in that's pretty cool [[00:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=3564.0s)]
*  That may have been an ACA meeting. I just didn't know the name of it, but that was definitely interesting and again [[00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=3567.7599999999998s)]
*  It's like you go to the meetings with some of these kids, and you think your life is tough, and you realize man [[00:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=3573.6s)]
*  There's always somebody who's got it much worse than you do yeah [[00:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=3578.56s)]
*  And that's it again. I think that's a good attitude to have because then you feel grateful for what you have [[00:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=3581.56s)]
*  That's another thing man like the feeling of gratitude is [[00:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=3586.4s)]
*  So empowering like if you're just grateful for what you have you know like yeah [[00:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=3590.44s)]
*  You know you and your wife have an argument, but if you're just grateful for her for her existence [[00:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=3595.7200000000003s)]
*  That's such a better attitude your kid does something that's annoying to you [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=3600.48s)]
*  But I'm just so grateful that I have this beautiful little baby that I get to take care of I don't know the feeling of gratitude [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=3603.56s)]
*  I think is a very powerful thing hmm. Yeah, and people say that a lot [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=3608.96s)]
*  Did was being a parent scary for you were you scared like absolutely yeah terrifying to me yeah, man I am [[01:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=3613.68s)]
*  Yeah, I was just I was taught by my childhood that most people really screw up parenting and [[01:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=3621.68s)]
*  You know it's not just like you make a mistake you get a bad grade or you know your boss is pissed off at you [[01:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=3628.24s)]
*  So you make a mistake and you're like screwing up you get a bad grade that has to go stay that stays alive stays alive [[01:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=3633.68s)]
*  Right [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=3639.16s)]
*  Really tough week and [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=3642.2s)]
*  You know like you have kids [[01:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=3644.3199999999997s)]
*  Yeah, so I mean you just you just love your kids so much right? [[01:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=3647.08s)]
*  I mean really think the sun shines out their ass. You know that's that's kind of how you see children [[01:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=3651.3199999999997s)]
*  Oh, yeah, like care Bears or whatever [[01:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=3655.3199999999997s)]
*  Like a care bear but a living breathing care bear yeah that you have to take care of and so I was just really terrific [[01:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=3659.0s)]
*  You know [[01:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=3665.8799999999997s)]
*  This has certainly gotten a lot better, but you know when I was 27 28 [[01:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=3667.0s)]
*  I had like a pretty bad temper you know like if somebody cut me off [[01:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=3671.64s)]
*  I'd be really pissed off now. I don't drive anymore because I have a Secret Service detail, which is probably a good thing, but [[01:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=3675.32s)]
*  But I but I you know like I just think to myself [[01:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=3681.24s)]
*  Oh my god is my kid gonna do something bad, and I'm gonna you know fly off the handle like you know [[01:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=3683.64s)]
*  Oh, yeah, I worry about that right and [[01:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=3688.44s)]
*  Yeah, I mean look certainly kids can be frustrating from time to time, but for whatever reason [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=3690.84s)]
*  I think it's part because my wife's so patient. It's in part just because I'm older and a little wiser is [[01:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=3695.3999999999996s)]
*  You know it's it's it's really worked out [[01:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=3701.8399999999997s)]
*  And I've you know I've screwed up, and I've made mistakes as a parent and certainly there are days where you're like [[01:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=3703.68s)]
*  Oh, man, I can't believe that I did this or that but [[01:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=3708.12s)]
*  you know one kids are much more resilient than people give them credit for and [[01:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=3711.48s)]
*  Two it's just it's a it's a learning process man. Yeah, and it's it's amazing. I mean kids are so [[01:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=3716.3599999999997s)]
*  so crazy like [[01:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=3722.6s)]
*  the the difference between [[01:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=3725.24s)]
*  Our two-year-old and our seven-year-old just in personality and what they say and you know kids have no filter [[01:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=3727.56s)]
*  Yeah, right so like one of the things that we call on our side of the aisle is that will like you know [[01:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=3734.96s)]
*  We'll call the news journalists the corporate media. I call them fake news [[01:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=3739.72s)]
*  Right you could be careful about that shit because my kids getting on the plane with me my four-year-old to come to an event and [[01:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=3743.12s)]
*  And somebody gets on that though on the loudspeaker. They're saying we're to sit or whatever [[01:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=3750.3999999999996s)]
*  No, we see he sees all these people taking photos of us and videos because I get photographed and video [[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=3754.4s)]
*  You know I'm constantly being photographed wherever I go and he sees these people with cameras. He goes daddy is that the fake news? [[01:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=3760.28s)]
*  And you you know you realize you got to be a little bit more careful about what you say no [[01:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=3767.76s)]
*  That's grandma now smile. Okay. That's just [[01:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=3772.96s)]
*  But yeah, I mean it's it's it's the most rewarding thing that I've ever done [[01:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=3778.44s)]
*  It's it's definitely changed my perspective [[01:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=3782.36s)]
*  Surprised you as to what it surprised you against your fears kind of it did it did I mean one? [[01:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=3784.36s)]
*  It's just not as it's not as hard. I guess as I thought it would be yeah, cuz I were that's what I just yeah [[01:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=3789.84s)]
*  I guess I don't know if I think about it being hard. I don't know it just feels like it would be so scary [[01:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=3794.32s)]
*  That's the word that comes into my head man [[01:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=3798.52s)]
*  It is it is scary [[01:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=3800.4s)]
*  But it's like one of those things where you just you know you just deal with it right and it's kind of good to confront [[01:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=3801.56s)]
*  That fear and then you realize it's not as bad [[01:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=3806.72s)]
*  I mean, you know most people tell you like the first kid gets completely babied right yeah [[01:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=3808.44s)]
*  And you know you oh you've got to put a hand sanitizer on before you touch touch the baby when they come home from the hospital [[01:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=3814.04s)]
*  And by the third kid you're like I don't you know you just played in the mud fine come up come over here [[01:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=3819.04s)]

*  But you also you just learn a lot about yourself and like the coolest thing right think about my mom [[01:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=3831.64s)]
*  I think my mom would be alive when I was 40 years old and now I see her play Pokemon with my little seven-year-old [[01:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=3836.92s)]
*  And yeah the relationship with these little kids, and it's just a really it's a really really rewarding thing [[01:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=3842.12s)]
*  I mean does it feel like a gift that you were able to give your mom almost us like and not you were able to [[01:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=3847.92s)]

*  Why isn't there a criminal investigation into this right like if I sold drugs on the street and some person has an overdose and died [[01:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=4438.2s)]
*  like [[01:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=4446.92s)]
*  You can get felony prosecuted for that [[01:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=4447.92s)]
*  Yeah, or at least investigated for it and there was never a criminal at least as I understand it never a criminal investigation into what was known [[01:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=4450.04s)]
*  Yeah, I think it's a plea deal of some sort [[01:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=4457.4s)]
*  Okay as the nation continues to grapple with that [[01:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=4460.44s)]
*  The Sackler family had agreed to pay $6 billion to families and states as part of an agreement to wind down Purdue Pharma [[01:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=4462.88s)]
*  The maker of Oxycontin and exchanges Sackler family would be immunized from future civil liability claims unreal cause here's my understanding about it [[01:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=4469.92s)]
*  and by the way, I think that like [[01:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=4477.4400000000005s)]
*  You always got to be worried about this stuff when you're the child of addiction is like are there whether it's drugs alcohol [[01:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=4479.64s)]
*  Whatever you got to be you kind of you're worried about making sure you do yourself don't get hooked on anything [[01:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=4485.400000000001s)]
*  I had a minor surgery once and like a very minor surgery and I was prescribed Oxycontin [[01:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=4490.44s)]
*  And I took it for like, you know 12 hours got any left. Sorry [[01:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=4496.6s)]
*  No, cuz my wife because of what I'm about to tell you. Okay, and [[01:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=4501.0s)]
*  My wife who was like giving me my meds. She was like, hey you ready for your next dose [[01:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=4504.92s)]
*  I was like, yeah, you know the pain's not really that bad anymore [[01:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=4509.2s)]
*  I don't really want to take one [[01:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=4511.32s)]
*  But yeah, just give me one cuz I feel really good when I take it and then she and I both have this like moment [[01:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=4512.84s)]
*  Realization like oh shit, right that is that is where this whole thing starts since she you know [[01:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=4517.5199999999995s)]
*  Took it to wherever some disposal site and got we got rid of it. That was it [[01:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=4522.5599999999995s)]
*  But the problem with Oxycontin is I understand it at least is [[01:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=4525.759999999999s)]
*  That it's supposed to be delayed release [[01:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=4530.12s)]
*  oxycodone [[01:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=4533.599999999999s)]
*  But you know the problem that is people figured out if you just crush it up [[01:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=4534.879999999999s)]
*  Yeah, then you could just get it all at once all released right now all released right now [[01:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=4540.0199999999995s)]
*  And then the Sackler family's understand it knew about it, right Purdue farm and knew this was going on and they should have been [[01:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=4544.12s)]
*  like oh no, no, okay, we're gonna stop this because [[01:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=4551.4s)]
*  People are getting killed by overdosing on this stuff because they're taking too high of a dose and they didn't do anything [[01:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=4554.2s)]
*  Yeah, like that is my understanding fundamentally of what happened is is they didn't want to stop because they were getting rich from it [[01:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=4559.04s)]
*  Oh, yeah, it's it's man. It's it's really gross [[01:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=4563.94s)]
*  I just couldn't imagine that imagine people dying and you're making money [[01:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=4566.32s)]
*  But they're dying people are dying family the ripple effect of that in this country is still it's still haunting people [[01:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=4569.44s)]
*  Absolutely, that's where the heroin epidemic which is now a fentanyl epidemic came from it started as a pill epidemic [[01:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=4576.5599999999995s)]
*  Yeah, and it actually was like I always used to think it was okay [[01:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=4582.12s)]
*  Kind of like me like oh you have a surgery and you get too many drugs [[01:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=4585.48s)]
*  Then eventually you get hooked what it actually was is they were over prescribing it so much that it was just everywhere [[01:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=4588.639999999999s)]
*  Yeah, right [[01:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=4595.0s)]
*  And so like oh, you know your nephew comes over and he's 17 and he takes them to his buddies and now they're all hooked on [[01:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=4595.84s)]
*  hooked on oxy and that's like that that's what actually happened and there was just so much of this drug everywhere that it started the [[01:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=4601.16s)]
*  Epidemic we have now. Yeah, and the outside it was like candy-coat [[01:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=4609.280000000001s)]
*  It's like you said a slurp off the outside a little bit and then you could party. Oh, I didn't realize that [[01:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=4612.76s)]
*  Yeah, I think you just had a slide. I heard about people crushing. I didn't know if you just had to slurp off the outside [[01:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=4618.84s)]
*  Yeah, I think you did and [[01:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=4623.6s)]
*  Yeah [[01:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=4627.400000000001s)]
*  Yeah, and yeah, and one of the worst things about it was that like medicine used to be a term that was like it was for [[01:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=4629.08s)]
*  Help right? Yes. It was like you know it was in our brains. I think as [[01:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=4634.46s)]
*  Humans and citizens in our society our culture medicine was help right? Yes, and that [[01:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=4639.08s)]
*  That whole thing with them kind of tripped that word where it made it [[01:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=4645.52s)]
*  It made people question the value of medicine absolutely it may be made people [[01:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=4650.5s)]
*  Just questioned then who's prescribing the medicine it made health it made like your doctors seem [[01:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=4655.74s)]
*  Untrustworthy yeah, it just it ruins so much [[01:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=4664.62s)]
*  Trust that's absolutely right ruined a lot of social trust and I agree [[01:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=4667.98s)]
*  I think they deserve a ton of blame for that and it's it's interesting though [[01:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=4672.099999999999s)]
*  That was maybe the first point the the oxy epidemic was sort of the first point where I started to question [[01:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=4678.08s)]
*  Like the mainstream big pharma narrative a little bit and I always ask myself [[01:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=4685.8s)]
*  And I think this is something you know like I'm Republican. I'm conservative [[01:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=4689.96s)]
*  But one of the things that I think the old left was pretty smart about is like recognizing that [[01:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=4693.22s)]
*  You know when when money gets involved when the profit motive gets involved in health [[01:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=4700.200000000001s)]
*  That can lead to good things right could lead to people trying to cure cancer [[01:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=4705.320000000001s)]
*  Because they know they're gonna make a lot of money if they cure cancer [[01:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=4709.4400000000005s)]
*  I'm fine with that right, but people making money if they cure cancer. That's a great thing, but then also sometimes it can lead to [[01:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=4711.8s)]
*  manipulation of the health system [[01:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=4718.400000000001s)]
*  That doesn't actually benefit people's health [[01:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=4720.68s)]
*  But does get people hooked on a lot of drugs that they wouldn't otherwise need and this was something again the old left understood [[01:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=4722.6s)]
*  This that like well you got to be careful like are we prescribing this medication? [[01:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=4728.72s)]
*  Because it's good for people because that's good [[01:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=4733.0s)]
*  Or are we prescribing it because some big pharmaceutical company is getting rich if we do and they're putting pressure on the government [[01:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=4735.12s)]
*  Or somebody else to encourage us to prescribe this medication [[01:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=4742.08s)]
*  Yeah, I think there are a whole host of ways in which you know frankly the old left was right about that and [[01:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=4745.28s)]
*  You know I've tried to persuade you know modern conservatives [[01:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=4751.86s)]
*  That we should be more concerned about that issue [[01:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=4756.08s)]
*  It's like you know Bobby Kennedy makes this point all the time right like good [[01:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=4757.88s)]
*  Some pharmaceuticals are good for us, but some actually it's not totally clear whether we're taking them [[01:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=4761.06s)]
*  Just because it makes people money, and this is like let me give you a concrete example right so [[01:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=4765.740000000001s)]
*  You know this there's obviously this big like debate about transgender issues, and you don't have to wait into that [[01:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=4772.02s)]
*  But what really worries me is when you've got? [[01:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=4778.18s)]
*  Pharmaceutical companies that are making billions of dollars on [[01:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=4782.740000000001s)]
*  Hormonal therapies for kids and are we really like are we really being smart about whether this is good for the kids about whether it causes [[01:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=4786.62s)]
*  Long-term consequences, and why is nobody saying well wait a second the people who are lobbying us to give these drugs to kids are [[01:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=4793.82s)]
*  Also getting rich off of right right, and I just I worry about that [[01:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=4801.099999999999s)]
*  I mean I follow the money motive yeah, man it definitely of course they would want that because it's just another way [[01:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=4804.7s)]
*  It's like well. How do we split the atom here again to make even more money off of somebody well? [[01:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=4809.84s)]
*  Your gender you know I'm saying you're not using it. Yeah, you know you're like what do you mean? [[01:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=4815.259999999999s)]
*  I'm not using my gender like I'm trying I'm trying to I'm still developing it [[01:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=4818.98s)]
*  Yeah, you know what I'm saying, and you're gonna like but I agree [[01:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=4823.9s)]
*  It's like a couple of my buddies secretly low-key date trans people right and I don't care if any somebody's trans or [[01:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=4827.139999999999s)]
*  Neapolitan or whatever I don't I don't care [[01:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=4834.139999999999s)]
*  You know what I'm saying hell if I had a vagina would probably go looking for women you know [[01:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=4836.179999999999s)]
*  so there's probably some up some up to it, but [[01:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=4840.98s)]
*  Talking about is uh shit. I don't know what I'm look, man [[01:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=4845.5s)]
*  If you're adult, but look where the money like look at the fall of the money [[01:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=4848.74s)]
*  We're talking about kids right all the money think about what's going on like are the people pushing this what is their real? [[01:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=4853.98s)]
*  Or do they have some other motive you have to think about that you know well [[01:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=4860.419999999999s)]
*  That's why I mean like you mentioned ozempic earlier [[01:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=4865.0199999999995s)]
*  Which you know a couple friends who've taken it [[01:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=4867.86s)]
*  I've never taken it was a big or any weight loss kind of drug [[01:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=4870.9s)]
*  Oh, it got it ended up having a black market there was somebody selling it outside of a vineyard vines [[01:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=4873.94s)]
*  Illegally or something over there outside of Charlottesville outside of vineyard vines that breaks my heart the most that's the perfect encapsulation [[01:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=4878.099999999999s)]
*  It breaks my heart [[01:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=4884.94s)]
*  Fine someone is a cap of Delta somebody said she was a capital [[01:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=4886.94s)]
*  That's really that's dark shit [[01:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=4896.74s)]
*  What goes on in politics a cap of Delta selling ozempic black market off out of a side of vineyard vines [[01:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=4900.86s)]
*  I'm gonna have nightmares. They call it foe's in pick, but I I you know I like worry [[01:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=4907.48s)]
*  Okay, so America has a terrible obesity problem. Okay, and I'm not look. I'm not a doctor [[01:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=4911.9s)]
*  I'm not telling if your doctor tells you to take ozempic follow your doctor's advice not you know what you're hearing [[01:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=4916.54s)]
*  I don't mind it a little [[01:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=4922.58s)]
*  I [[01:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=4925.0599999999995s)]
*  What I worry about is okay [[01:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=4926.62s)]
*  You know you create a problem and then you medicate to solve the problem instead of like maybe solving the underlying problem, right? [[01:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=4929.0599999999995s)]
*  Like why don't we try to understand why it is that we have a terrible obesity epidemic rather than just giving people another pill to pop [[01:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=4936.58s)]
*  Well, it's also we get used to that then after a while [[01:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=4943.66s)]
*  And then it's hard to put the toothpaste back in the tooth exactly right that's one of the tough [[01:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=4945.94s)]
*  That's one of and that's more of like a kind of a bigger look at that like [[01:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=4949.58s)]
*  Yeah, it's like how much personal responsibility it's like [[01:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=4952.98s)]
*  That's something I struggle with sometimes my brother, and I talk about this sometimes like you know people have problems and [[01:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=4957.0199999999995s)]
*  Specifically even like thinking about the Oxycontin like they created a medicine that was so strong that even your [[01:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=4964.219999999999s)]
*  ability your God-given ability to be able to [[01:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=4971.94s)]
*  To be able to [[01:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=4975.78s)]
*  Battle against it like you'd be in a rooms [[01:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=4977.38s)]
*  And you'd see people that came in from opioid and it was something different than alcoholism exactly right it wasn't alcohol [[01:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=4980.26s)]
*  It wasn't it was addiction, but it was something different. It was like that's right these people that's zombie these people [[01:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=4986.02s)]
*  It's like it's like they created this [[01:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=4991.84s)]
*  This skip card in uno or something it was like so at that point like [[01:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=4995.42s)]
*  Shit were we talking about I had a good idea [[01:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=5000.62s)]
*  Talking about opioids the effect it has on people's brains [[01:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=5003.42s)]
*  pharmaceutical companies making money from [[01:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=5007.9s)]
*  We're talking about a Zipik put into the toothpaste back in the tube right right personal responsibility. Yeah, yes, okay. You were almost there [[01:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=5010.9s)]
*  Sorry, you helped me you laid all the bread crumbs [[01:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=5016.9s)]
*  so [[01:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=5020.74s)]
*  But yeah, I'm here to help man. This is your next vice president. I'll live to serve however I can [[01:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=5022.34s)]
*  You just help me right there, but yeah, it's like um [[01:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=5028.0199999999995s)]
*  The but then they created something was so powerful it kind of exceeded our ability our natural ability to be able to fight against it [[01:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=5031.900000000001s)]
*  Right so at that point um [[01:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=5038.18s)]
*  personal responsibility [[01:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=5040.860000000001s)]
*  Kind of isn't it's it's still there, but it's not exactly fair because you're allowing company to create something that you can't [[01:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=5042.900000000001s)]
*  Naturally compete against it turns you into a zombie man. Yeah, I mean really that took so long my brain [[01:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=5052.700000000001s)]
*  No, it's it's I know exactly what you mean [[01:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=5059.46s)]
*  And it's it's it's it's like one thing to sort of take a pill so your pain goes away [[01:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=5061.900000000001s)]
*  Or you take a pill because you know you got a lung infection [[01:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=5066.22s)]
*  The lung infection goes away or like whatever when something can so fundamentally transform your personality in your sense of you know [[01:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=5068.700000000001s)]
*  Ambition and reward like what do you what are you going? [[01:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=5077.740000000001s)]
*  Yeah, it's not a medicine. It's very it's a very very weird [[01:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=5080.700000000001s)]
*  Like that's the thing it's not a medicine that is a drug [[01:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=5084.620000000001s)]
*  Yeah, and I mean my mom like to her great credit, man [[01:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=5087.02s)]
*  I don't know how she does this because like look there are some things where you really do need a strong pain medication right and [[01:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=5090.820000000001s)]
*  I forget something happened a couple years ago where they were like you know [[01:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=5096.780000000001s)]
*  Shit, maybe she had some infection, but they really wanted to give her oxy and she was like no I refused to take it [[01:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=5100.34s)]
*  So she for a couple days. I mean she was in agonizing pain, but she just took Advil took Tylenol and she was fine [[01:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=5107.200000000001s)]
*  Yeah, and she and she and she persevered through it, but man you're right the stuff it. It's just yeah [[01:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=5113.78s)]
*  It's like it changes not just your personality, but it changes [[01:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=5119.82s)]
*  Whether you can take care of yourself and other people right like for most normal people. There's this thing where it's like oh oh crap [[01:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=5124.58s)]
*  I'm not taking care of my kids my kids need me. I got to change something right, but if you're on opioids [[01:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=5131.219999999999s)]
*  It's like it flips a switch off [[01:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=5137.78s)]
*  Where yeah, I'm not taking care of my kids, but maybe I don't give a shit [[01:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=5140.179999999999s)]
*  Because the drugs have so affected my brain yeah, I think that's it man um [[01:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=5143.78s)]
*  And with that so it's staying in the health in like medical and health care thoughts yeah [[01:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=5149.219999999999s)]
*  One of the major and I wrote this down so I could say it clearly and to just save everybody time was listening [[01:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=5155.46s)]
*  One of the major bipartisan issues that's plaguing Americans is the health care system which has become [[01:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=5161.5s)]
*  Outrageously expensive right it's uh it's unaffordable. It's inaccessible by millions of Americans [[01:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=5167.58s)]
*  We're overpaying hospitals and insurance companies that hide their prices. Yes, and they charge us whatever they want [[01:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=5173.52s)]
*  Yeah, patients overpay workers overpay [[01:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=5179.92s)]
*  Companies overpay the taxpayers overpay [[01:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=5183.4400000000005s)]
*  On this podcast Bernie Sanders came on and he stressed the need for a health care price transparency [[01:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=5186.400000000001s)]
*  Donald Trump did the same thing he had an executive order yeah, I think it's still in place that demands price transparency [[01:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=5192.08s)]
*  Mark Cuban stressed the need for health care price transparency [[01:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=5200.26s)]
*  How do we not have real prices and transparency in health care knowing that it's exactly what America needs? [[01:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=5204.02s)]
*  so that our health care system will be honest and affordable and [[01:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=5209.9s)]
*  Accessible well you're right that we should have it and [[01:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=5214.86s)]
*  The reason that we don't is unfortunately because there are a lot of powerful people who get rich off of keeping these things secret [[01:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=5217.7s)]
*  And so they don't want transparency. They don't want sunshine you can say Chuck Schumer if you want [[01:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=5224.06s)]
*  Well, I mean look you're right though like obviously Bernie, and I are on the same team politically [[01:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=5230.34s)]
*  But there are some health care things like price transparency [[01:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=5234.58s)]
*  We're actually I think he and President Trump are both right that there's nothing that you go to Starbucks right you buy coffee [[01:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=5237.18s)]
*  You know how much you're getting you know how much it's it's costing you [[01:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=5243.12s)]
*  You know I remember when my wife. I think was our second baby [[01:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=5246.9800000000005s)]
*  Where you know you get like pain medications because when you're delivering a baby at least most people do because it's like a very painful experience [[01:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=5251.58s)]
*  Yeah, and there was some weird thing where the the doctor that she chose was out of network and she didn't real [[01:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=5258.099999999999s)]
*  I mean you know you're not checking whether the doctors in network at the time right you just sort of choosing a doctor [[01:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=5266.099999999999s)]
*  And we come home [[01:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=5270.44s)]
*  We have like a fifteen thousand dollar unexpected bill because she chose the wrong doctor an hour before she delivers a baby [[01:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=5271.5199999999995s)]
*  And it's like this is totally crazy, and I'm you know we're in a situation where that was not a big deal for us [[01:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=5279.179999999999s)]
*  We were able to afford it, but like a normal middle-class family goes and has a baby and comes home to a medical bill [[01:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=5284.82s)]
*  That's like a fifth of their entire take-home pay that year right that's crazy number one cause of [[01:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=5292.0599999999995s)]
*  bankruptcy in America is [[01:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=5298.58s)]
*  Medical debt yeah, it's it's it's a huge huge problem [[01:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=5300.58s)]
*  And I think the price transparency is a big part of it [[01:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=5304.219999999999s)]
*  But you ask like why hasn't it happened because every time that we try to force price price transparency [[01:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=5306.2s)]
*  the service the service providers [[01:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=5312.299999999999s)]
*  The insurance companies or the pharmaceutical companies don't actually want that transparency [[01:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=5314.82s)]
*  Here's one of the reasons why the pharmaceutical companies don't want transparency [[01:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=5319.34s)]
*  It's because if Americans if we realized how much more we were paying for pharmaceuticals over the Europeans [[01:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=5322.7s)]
*  There would be a revolution in this country [[01:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=5329.099999999999s)]
*  We pay a lot more than them pay way more than them and again like I my attitude is I am fine with people [[01:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=5331.139999999999s)]
*  You know if you invent a life-saving cancer drug [[01:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=5338.42s)]
*  I'm fine with people [[01:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=5341.9s)]
*  Earning a great profit for doing something amazing like that you want to you want to motivate people to do it in the first place [[01:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=5344.299999999999s)]
*  Right and and a lot of people were obviously motivated by that profit motive [[01:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=5349.7s)]
*  But if you take certain drugs that are you know they cost $100 in the United States of America and [[01:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=5354.0599999999995s)]
*  They're way way cheaper in Europe or some of these really expensive multi-thousand cancer bring something up for me. Yeah [[01:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=5360.98s)]
*  These really expensive like next-generation cancer therapeutics they cost way less in Europe [[01:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=5367.9800000000005s)]
*  Okay, and just says in 2022 US prices across all drugs brands and generics were nearly [[01:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=5373.860000000001s)]
*  2.78 times as high as prices in in the comparison countries US prices for brand drugs were at least [[01:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=5380.26s)]
*  3.22 times as high as prices in the comparison countries even after adjustments for estimated US rebates [[01:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=5387.9800000000005s)]
*  Wow did it show those countries is there a chart with that or no? [[01:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=5394.54s)]
*  I love it. It's it's it's OECD countries, which is made mainly Europe. Those are like, okay the advanced economies basically the okay [[01:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=5397.78s)]
*  That's what that means rich countries basically OECD. Yeah, and and what so first world countries probably basically. Okay. Yeah, so Canada [[01:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=5405.3s)]
*  Probably Israel's in there a lot of the a lot of the European countries. I think are all in OCD. Okay, United States Germany Canada Japan [[01:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=5412.9800000000005s)]
*  Sweet Serlin Switzerland, I can't see that [[01:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=5420.88s)]
*  What's your little yes, we heard of that? Yeah comparable County average [[01:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=5425.52s)]
*  You're screwing with me Austria [[01:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=5435.2s)]
*  Well, I think they misspelled it dude, there's not that many zits in it [[01:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=5439.4800000000005s)]
*  Oh Australia United Kingdom of Sweden Wow, so we pay per capita spending on prescription drugs in 2019 [[01:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=5444.98s)]
*  900 and what does per capita mean just per person? Okay per person [[01:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=5451.58s)]
*  963 dollars per person whereas in Sweden [[01:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=5455.66s)]
*  $270 United Kingdom [[01:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=5458.78s)]
*  $273 dude. Yeah, that's crazy, right? Yeah, that's not fair. They colonize everybody and they're paying cheaper [[01:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=5461.5s)]
*  It's exactly right [[01:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=5469.0599999999995s)]
*  But again, but again the reason we don't really know what we're paying here is because you know because they hide it they hide it [[01:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=5471.700000000001s)]
*  They hide it and they don't want to let people know because if you let people know then they would demand to pay less [[01:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=5478.38s)]
*  But what something President Trump of propose for example, I think is a very good idea is that he proposed? [[01:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=5485.5s)]
*  Reimporting drugs from Europe. Basically if they're selling it in Sweden or wherever for [[01:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=5491.700000000001s)]
*  $270 per person and we're paying [[01:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=5497.98s)]
*  $963 per person then we'll just buy it in Sweden and bring in the United States. I love that right? [[01:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=5500.78s)]
*  That was a big big thing. Of course, the pharmaceutical companies don't like that [[01:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=5506.0599999999995s)]
*  But that's why you guys that's why they try to assassinate him twice. Well, it's probably one of the things that could happen [[01:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=5509.26s)]
*  I mean, I of course have no idea no inside knowledge [[01:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=5513.74s)]
*  Into into what drove the motives of the assassins. Oh, yeah, I'm just joking [[01:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=5518.0599999999995s)]
*  But I mean a lot of money and I wouldn't be shocked if there's some really dark stuff out there because look [[01:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=5523.74s)]
*  Two separate people have tried to take a swing at this guy in about three months [[01:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=5528.9s)]
*  Yeah, like well, you know, they didn't like Donald Trump, right because they wouldn't try to shoot him if they if they liked him [[01:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=5533.38s)]
*  But I wouldn't be the first guy who went after Trump made to put on the tin foil out here [[01:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=5539.219999999999s)]
*  But we've not been able to get it unable to get into his phone [[01:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=5544.12s)]
*  We know that he had all these like foreign encrypted apps on his cell phone [[01:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=5547.44s)]
*  It is crazy to me that we don't know the guy's motive. Yeah, it's nuts. He almost killed the president [[01:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=5552.04s)]
*  Yeah, and we don't know why he did it. We don't know anything about the guy. Yeah. Yeah, they're like he had a lunchbox or something [[01:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=5559.32s)]
*  It's like the vaguest information they keep putting out about the guy, you know, he's been using a library [[01:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=5565.24s)]
*  His mom's name was Sharon it's like great. Thank you [[01:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=5573.0s)]
*  Oh [[01:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=5575.56s)]
*  They're like oh he was a Colts fan [[01:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=5579.88s)]
*  So, how do we stop that do you get up do you get approached by lobbyists and stuff like that like all the time do you [[01:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=5588.200000000001s)]
*  Really? And what does that look like? Who are they? What are they wearing? [[01:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=5593.4400000000005s)]
*  There there so lobbyists here's how you spot them, okay [[01:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=5598.92s)]
*  They're always [[01:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=5603.240000000001s)]
*  Wearing poorly fitted suits mm-hmm with extremely ugly ties [[01:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=5604.92s)]
*  So if you go out you see a guy with a poorly fitting suit an extremely ugly tie, he's definitely a lobbyist [[01:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=5609.36s)]
*  Okay, okay. It's like it's like in happy Gilmore. It's a lobbyist for big fabric, huh? It sounds like [[01:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=5614.24s)]
*  it's like in a happy Gilmore where the guys like [[01:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=5620.56s)]
*  You know the the the coach is trying to get happy Gilmore to play golf and happy is like, you know [[01:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=5624.76s)]
*  You know what you need to play golf is? [[01:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=5629.88s)]
*  goofy goofy pants and a fat ass [[01:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=5632.400000000001s)]
*  That's what you need to be a lobbyist [[01:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=5635.36s)]
*  Goofy pants and that but why can't we if everybody knows like golf gonna be clear. I like golf. Do you like all I? [[01:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=5637.4800000000005s)]
*  I'm not that good at it. Okay, I'll play when I get a little bit older [[01:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=5645.16s)]
*  I don't want to slow people down. Okay, right now fair point, you know, but anyway, yes [[01:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=5648.16s)]
*  So okay the way the late Brooks Koepka. Yeah, I do too [[01:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=5652.0s)]
*  He's cool. Yeah, he's like a cool dude, and I like that girl that smokes that plays [[01:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=5656.04s)]
*  Only for one woman I've got only my wife, you know, I like [[01:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=5664.88s)]
*  No comment no comment no comment from senator Vance I know you're talking about yeah, ha ha ha ha ha ha [[01:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=5671.36s)]
*  So John Daly doesn't really do it for you [[01:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=5679.84s)]
*  He's a good he's a good dude though. I know I like John man, it's really oh if you need a ride in an ambulance [[01:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=5683.400000000001s)]
*  Hang out with John [[01:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=5689.36s)]
*  You'll get one in heartbeat and I just joking I think it was tired also, it's true [[01:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=5691.28s)]
*  I've been at two places where John's been taking one time. They came in looking for him [[01:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=5696.219999999999s)]
*  He went out there and was sitting in the shot [[01:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=5700.32s)]
*  He tried to help you [[01:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=5708.36s)]
*  He's a legend he's got a good one here soon [[01:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=5711.44s)]
*  But how do we start that if all the centers in Congress people know it like Bernie Sanders said there's three times as many lobbyists [[01:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=5713.599999999999s)]
*  In DC as there are [[01:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=5720.16s)]
*  Congressman and senators then why don't we get that shit out like [[01:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=5724.12s)]
*  Okay, here's why doesn't it stop like if all you guys know it and everybody's supposed to be working for the people then why [[01:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=5728.24s)]
*  Doesn't it stop? [[01:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=5733.66s)]
*  So I actually think that we're getting a little bit better compared to maybe ten years ago people have no idea [[01:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=5734.68s)]
*  how much Washington was just completely run by lobbyists and [[01:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=5740.32s)]
*  You know you think about like guy on the left like Bernie Sanders, but most importantly a guy on the right like Donald Trump [[01:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=5743.76s)]
*  Completely blows the existing system up [[01:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=5749.58s)]
*  And this is by the way like what I realized because I wasn't a Trump guy back in 2016 and obviously I was running mate now [[01:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=5751.5s)]
*  So I really like him what people don't realize is back in 2016 how much lobbyist [[01:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=5756.9s)]
*  Money and influence there was that wanted to destroy Donald Trump [[01:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=5762.58s)]
*  They hated the guy because he didn't owe anything to them right he didn't come from the existing political process [[01:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=5766.66s)]
*  And if you look at some of the younger guys who have come in, you know [[01:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=5772.379999999999s)]
*  We're much more just open about the fact that lobbyist influence is out there, right? [[01:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=5775.82s)]
*  You can't be in DC without running into these people, but you got to be honest with people like [[01:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=5780.82s)]
*  I'm not gonna let this person write a piece of legislation for me [[01:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=5786.38s)]
*  I'm not gonna let this person dictate how I vote and yeah [[01:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=5789.28s)]
*  I've gotten some definitely some criticisms from the lobbyist groups in DC some of them will say well [[01:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=5792.36s)]
*  You know we don't know if we can trust this guy and that's fine with me. I'm okay [[01:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=5797.26s)]
*  I'm okay with it not trust you exactly good exactly doing your job. That's exactly right [[01:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=5800.78s)]
*  That's that's my exact attitude towards it. I don't know if he can trust you who gives a fuck exactly. That's exactly right [[01:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=5804.86s)]
*  So but that but that that is how the town works is that if you come in and you don't always take their meetings [[01:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=5811.82s)]
*  You don't always do what they want you to then they'll start whispering about you and then they can get [[01:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=5817.66s)]
*  Articles written about you they can have people say bad shit about you [[01:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=5821.62s)]
*  this is why people call it the corporate media is if you pick up a story in the Washington Post and you read it and [[01:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=5824.4s)]
*  You know here's this anonymous source of this this anonymous source said that [[01:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=5829.98s)]
*  There is a 98 percent chance [[01:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=5833.64s)]
*  That the person who's attacking Donald Trump is on the take somehow for sure whether it's a lobbyist or whether it's a political consultant [[01:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=5836.4800000000005s)]
*  It's all dishonest money laundering bullshit [[01:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=5842.52s)]
*  That's all DC ultimately is is people who get paid to offer an opinion instead of having a real opinion [[01:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=5845.96s)]
*  Here's the thing that I think we need to fix structurally about this so let me give an example [[01:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=5851.6s)]
*  you know my Senate staff has probably 40 or so people and [[01:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=5855.4800000000005s)]
*  And [[01:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=5858.639999999999s)]
*  You know all extremely good people my staff tends to be a little bit younger because I'm one of the youngest [[01:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=5859.88s)]
*  I'm the second youngest US senator right now and [[01:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=5865.16s)]
*  You know like if I wanted to pay my chief of staff [[01:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=5868.24s)]
*  $30,000 more a year than what I pay him right now. I'm not allowed by law [[01:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=5872.719999999999s)]
*  So even though I'm a senator, and I was elected to represent the people of Ohio. I'm not allowed to control [[01:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=5876.639999999999s)]
*  Who I pay and how I pay them it's all sort of set by law and here's the bigger issue [[01:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=5882.639999999999s)]
*  Is that if you think about it? [[01:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=5888.28s)]
*  You know a lot of this a lot of these big important laws are very complicated right they've got 800 pages 900 pages [[01:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=5890.84s)]
*  And I think the laws should be simpler [[01:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=5897.08s)]
*  But if you've got a 900 page law, and you've got a bunch of sense junior staffers [[01:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=5898.719999999999s)]
*  Who don't know the town very well, and they don't make a whole lot of money? [[01:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=5904.16s)]
*  Then the people who are writing the laws are not going to be your junior staffers [[01:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=5909.4s)]
*  It's going to be the lobbyists right and we've seen this multiple times with legislation that I've drafted [[01:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=5913.48s)]
*  where the lobbyists will actually ask to get into like the draft of the law and [[01:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=5918.24s)]
*  Make changes for you and say well. Yeah, well we'll justify no no no no [[01:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=5922.8s)]
*  I want my staff that works for me to write the laws that I'm drafting, but we I actually think that we need to [[01:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=5926.84s)]
*  empower senators and congressmen [[01:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=5934.719999999999s)]
*  To hire who they want to make a bigger staff if they want because if you think about it [[01:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=5936.96s)]
*  The amount of staff a congressman has a congresswoman has is a fraction of the federal budget [[01:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=5941.5599999999995s)]
*  we're talking about like a percent of a percent of a penny on the federal budget and so [[01:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=5946.2s)]
*  We could actually give people the staff that they need [[01:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=5952.92s)]
*  To to be able to actually write the laws and to make sure the lobbyists don't have much influence and yes [[01:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=5956.48s)]
*  Like who are the lobbyists okay? [[01:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=5961.599999999999s)]
*  The lobbyists are the people who are really good staffers [[01:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=5963.96s)]
*  And then the staffers want to buy a nicer house, and they want to you know start a family [[01:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=5968.4s)]
*  And they can't you know DC's a very expensive town [[01:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=5972.8s)]
*  I mean you know a one-bedroom [[01:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=5975.16s)]
*  Apartment in DC will easily run you four thousand dollars a month right yeah, right? [[01:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=5978.24s)]
*  It's just a very expensive town so then those people go and become lobbyists [[01:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=5981.88s)]
*  They trade in their public service for a fat check, and I think that we got to fix something [[01:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=5985.72s)]
*  I think that happened with um with OxyContin [[01:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=5991.16s)]
*  They got the people that were working with the FDA to come and work for them. That's exactly right that is exactly right [[01:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=5993.639999999999s)]
*  So it happens at our Congress it happens with our big bureaucratic agencies [[01:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=5999.76s)]
*  And I think we have to fix something about that like we want the people in our government to be public spirited and focus on [[01:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=6003.76s)]
*  Doing the public good [[01:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=6009.8s)]
*  I don't think that the system that we have works very well where you know you do public service for a little bit [[01:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=6010.68s)]
*  And then you jump and go make a million dollars a year as a lobbyist right no no no no no [[01:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=6016.24s)]
*  You got I think you got to separate those functions much better than you have right now [[01:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=6020.16s)]
*  Yeah, because then then you're then like being a public servant is just a junior college for being becoming a lobbyist [[01:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=6024.280000000001s)]
*  That is a big a big worry that I have [[01:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=6031.36s)]
*  Especially with my staff. I mean these are really smart really good guys and a big part of what I think about [[01:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=6034.76s)]
*  a [[01:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=6039.52s)]
*  Big part of what I think about is how am I gonna keep these guys as they get more senior as they become better at their [[01:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=6041.28s)]
*  Job as they become better at figuring out what a lobbyist is trying to sell them a bill of goods right that's a skill [[01:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=6047.16s)]
*  Right and you acquire that skill over time when they can just spend whatever they want when they're the Yankees [[01:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=6052.64s)]
*  That's exactly right [[01:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=6057.64s)]
*  Yeah [[01:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=6059.28s)]
*  Shit dude we're all gonna be addicted [[01:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=6062.84s)]
*  No, we're not man. I'm telling you we're gonna. I'm telling you we're actually going in the right direction [[01:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=6065.8s)]
*  This is what people don't you know I recognize you play have of your millions of listeners some people love Trump and some people [[01:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=6070.32s)]
*  Hate him, but but the thing that Trump really changed about DC is that he was not beholden to the moneyed interests [[01:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=6076.04s)]
*  Oh, well, that's one thing that I also like about Bobby Kennedy that I mean [[01:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=6084.12s)]
*  Bobby's been a friend of mine for years I knew him before I thought he was gonna be due politics [[01:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=6088.0s)]
*  Yeah, he's a good dude man [[01:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=6092.759999999999s)]
*  He used to hold meetings at his house on Tuesdays, and we would go to him [[01:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=6094.44s)]
*  Yeah in his backyard dude and one of his dogs always was slobber and stuff on me was a huge dog [[01:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=6097.639999999999s)]
*  It might not even have been a dog because he has a lot of animals. What would it have been then? [[01:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=6102.98s)]
*  I don't know dude, but he's had a lot of animals over the years and Bobby what we can afford probably [[01:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=6106.54s)]
*  What was this maybe dog that was slobbering all over Theo, but he doesn't need anything else [[01:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=6111.44s)]
*  He's got a great name. He's got a cool wife [[01:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=6115.72s)]
*  He's got he doesn't he's always cared about just making people healthy if he is he wrong sometimes on things sure [[01:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=6118.52s)]
*  He probably is just like anybody else everybody, but I fucking I'd rather have somebody just raise their hand and ask questions like [[01:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=6124.92s)]
*  Only that's one thing that I just love about him that he's not beholding to any of these people you know the thing that I hate [[01:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=6131.280000000001s)]
*  about politics and just media culture in this country right now man is [[01:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=6136.34s)]
*  People are so afraid of saying anything that's unconventional [[01:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=6141.52s)]
*  They're they're afraid of thinking thoughts that you're not allowed to think like the biggest ideas come from people who just follow [[01:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=6146.360000000001s)]
*  The truth right and yeah sometimes they're gonna be wrong sometimes [[01:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=6154.400000000001s)]
*  They're not gonna get everything right, but we've got to stop punishing people like Bobby Kennedy for saying well maybe [[01:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=6158.54s)]
*  What about that yeah? Hey? What about that exactly like that? [[01:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=6165.24s)]
*  Hey, what about that is something we have to preserve and I do feel like we're trying to do [[01:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=6167.9s)]
*  We're kind of destroying it this this is so I'm gonna sound like an old man [[01:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=6172.139999999999s)]
*  But this is what I think is really jacked up about social media is [[01:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=6176.339999999999s)]
*  Okay, we're all social animals right we're all influenced by people around us. Oh, yeah, but look 30 years ago an [[01:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=6180.259999999999s)]
*  Opinion it would take it many many days [[01:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=6187.94s)]
*  Before an opinion became the accepted conventional wisdom [[01:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=6191.42s)]
*  You know you'd have to be repeated in one newspaper then repeated in another newspaper and people would talk about it now [[01:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=6194.98s)]
*  You can have something happen on social media. It's viral and ten minutes later [[01:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=6200.66s)]
*  You've got like the social media feeding frenzy that says well [[01:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=6205.86s)]
*  Here's this thing that I came up with ten minutes ago [[01:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=6209.48s)]
*  And if you don't agree with that thing I came up with ten minutes ago, then there's gonna be a feeding frenzy [[01:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=6211.78s)]
*  Attacking you attacking your family finding out where you worked and attack it trying to attack your employer for keeping you in a job [[01:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=6217.099999999999s)]
*  Like that is a really jacked up thing to take [[01:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=6223.879999999999s)]
*  the the normal human social impulse to want to be liked and to you know want to make friends and [[01:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=6226.799999999999s)]
*  To put it all on the internet where it operates at like the speed of light [[01:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=6232.599999999999s)]
*  I think there's something very deranged about that. Yeah. Yeah. Well, and it's also it's like we [[01:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=6236.48s)]
*  Are you a repeater or you a thinker like yes, that's the thing [[01:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=6243.12s)]
*  It's like we get so preoccupied now and so occupied so quickly that we don't even [[01:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=6246.4s)]
*  Put it through our own filter exactly right and it's like and then our filter starts to not even be a filter anymore because [[01:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=6252.5599999999995s)]
*  It's like well, nobody's using me. I'll just I'm just a pathway now. Yeah, and that's what starts to happen [[01:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=6259.12s)]
*  That's how we all start to become [[01:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=6264.679999999999s)]
*  Desensitized everything and we just become repeaters right that that's exactly what social media does is it just turns us all into repeaters [[01:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=6267.32s)]
*  I like that Bobby Kennedy is sort of willing to say no. No, I'm actually gonna think for myself on this topic [[01:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=6273.08s)]
*  I mean it is crazy. Why why do we have such a terrible obesity problem? [[01:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=6278.68s)]
*  Why do we have all these like, you know certain types of diabetes are on the rise among children today? [[01:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=6282.88s)]
*  it's like okay, we're the richest country in the history of the world and [[01:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=6289.240000000001s)]
*  You know children are getting diseases that they didn't get 30 40 years ago [[01:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=6292.56s)]
*  Like somebody should be saying what the hell is going on or like [[01:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=6296.780000000001s)]
*  Yeah, somebody should and it should be our leaders, but they feels like there's so much [[01:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=6300.4400000000005s)]
*  Compromise in there. I mean dude, do you know? Okay, this is a paper by a Nobel. Yeah. Yeah, we're yeah, we'll take a few more minutes. Yeah [[01:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=6304.759999999999s)]
*  Now we're just having fun but there's a paper by a Nobel Prize winning economist [[01:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=6314.44s)]
*  that talks about the return to education in years of life and [[01:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=6320.08s)]
*  Do you know how much take a person who's got a four-year degree? [[01:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=6326.679999999999s)]
*  Versus a person who never went to college [[01:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=6330.4800000000005s)]
*  Do you know how much longer the person with a four-year degree lives in the United States of America right now? [[01:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=6332.4800000000005s)]
*  Seven years seven years longer. Yeah, so going to college [[01:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=6337.64s)]
*  You get rewarded with seven years of additional life [[01:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=6342.68s)]
*  If that doesn't tell you something is seriously fucked up in our country then nothing will right that is not okay [[01:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=6345.4400000000005s)]
*  And it's part of it. It's it's health part of it's that [[01:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=6351.68s)]
*  You know people are working more dangerous jobs if they don't have a college degree [[01:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=6356.08s)]
*  But part of it's just that we have have I think made it so hard to get by in our country if you don't have [[01:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=6360.72s)]
*  A four-year degree that people are you know? [[01:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=6367.320000000001s)]
*  They're not making enough money to support their families and they get stressed out then they turn to addiction [[01:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=6370.400000000001s)]
*  Of course addiction happens to everybody but it's much more common among those without a college degree [[01:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=6374.56s)]
*  Yeah, so I just this to me is like what what is this campaign about? [[01:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=6379.360000000001s)]
*  Like what is Trump being president about is fixing the big problems [[01:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=6383.44s)]
*  Not like the bullshit fake problems that the media gets us to focus on not the slogans [[01:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=6387.639999999999s)]
*  But why are people dying seven years earlier if they don't have a college degree? [[01:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=6393.799999999999s)]
*  Why do we have this historic obesity epidemic in the richest country in the world? [[01:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=6398.759999999999s)]
*  Why do we have like wars breaking out like crazy all over the world? Why do pharmaceutical companies get rich? [[01:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=6403.599999999999s)]
*  By forcing therapeutics that aren't even always good for us right like these are like big big big issues that [[01:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=6411.0s)]
*  Frankly, I think absent Trump. We wouldn't even be talking about this stuff. Well. I mean I definitely think that [[01:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=6418.400000000001s)]
*  one of the things that [[01:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=6425.160000000001s)]
*  Certainly excited me about Trump when he first was running was wow this guy is fucking rogue [[01:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=6427.200000000001s)]
*  And you know what it's and this whole thing is so messed up now [[01:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=6434.76s)]
*  That that's what you I would I hated politics so much [[01:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=6439.12s)]
*  I just I hated that I was like I would hire a I would hire a muppet to go in there with a hammer [[01:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=6442.64s)]
*  That's right [[01:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=6450.08s)]
*  I would hire a muppet with a hammer if I could vote for a muppet with a hammer [[01:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=6450.92s)]
*  And that's how most people feel it's like it doesn't even feel like it's working for us anymore. So what does it even matter? Yeah? [[01:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=6454.2s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, but so that's why I think Bobby. That's one thing that I did [[01:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=6460.96s)]
*  That's one thing that I thought was pretty amazing about bringing Bobby Kennedy on [[01:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=6464.4800000000005s)]
*  Into you guys's campaign is that? [[01:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=6468.04s)]
*  He's a sheriff for that kind of shit. He really is you know for caring [[01:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=6470.88s)]
*  I think for just for genuinely caring about people I know I know he cares about people [[01:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=6475.280000000001s)]
*  It's like I have friends that don't care about me. They're still my friends some of them, but he's a friend [[01:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=6479.52s)]
*  That is a caring guy. Yeah, yeah, absolutely right, so that is I think why I've bowed for him a lot. Yeah [[01:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=6484.080000000001s)]
*  I had one more thing. Let me say [[01:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=6489.68s)]
*  Oh [[01:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=6493.080000000001s)]
*  The polls and stuff okay. Yeah, yeah, I've been looking at the polls recently um yeah [[01:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=6494.08s)]
*  And especially at here how she has a place where I look at them, okay? [[01:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=6499.04s)]
*  This is the betting market stuff yeah [[01:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=6502.16s)]
*  They're a website and an app where people can bet money on regular happenings like in society [[01:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=6504.24s)]
*  Yeah, like not just pop political stuff anything from like politics to entertainment [[01:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=6508.68s)]
*  And I think it's a good tracker of in a capitalistic society because it's people putting their money down right it's like so [[01:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=6513.04s)]
*  It's people saying this is what I think right with my money as opposed to just other polls [[01:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=6519.0199999999995s)]
*  um [[01:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=6524.12s)]
*  What what's the latest on there? What does it say? Oh? [[01:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=6525.4s)]
*  It's like Trump is 57 commas 43 Trump 57% [[01:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=6528.5199999999995s)]
*  That's pretty good. Yeah, that's pretty good to just say the total amount of money that people have better not yet [[01:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=6534.24s)]
*  Oh, it says 32 million nine hundred and seventeen thousand well [[01:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=6539.719999999999s)]
*  No, it has been put out there. Yeah on this it just yeah [[01:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=6543.24s)]
*  So that's why I like to follow their stuff just because it's actually people putting their money down [[01:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=6547.24s)]
*  Sure are there what do you think of polls that are out there these days? [[01:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=6551.44s)]
*  Do you guys follow these polls is that real stuff to you like I know that like they had the Clinton Trump poll years ago [[01:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=6554.799999999999s)]
*  And they had Clinton it was neck and neck or something and then it wasn't when it came out [[01:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=6561.08s)]
*  Yeah, do you guys follow any of that or is that really part of the daily routine not really man? [[01:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=6565.5599999999995s)]
*  I mean I can I can get you in the weeds a little bit [[01:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=6570.5199999999995s)]
*  But I'll try to I'll try to I live and breathe this stuff so I try not to make it make it too [[01:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=6573.16s)]
*  Trust a lot of media, so it's here's yeah [[01:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=6578.24s)]
*  Here's basically the way you shouldn't trust polls [[01:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=6580.24s)]
*  Whether they're good for us or bad for us, and here's the reason you shouldn't trust polls is [[01:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=6583.04s)]
*  About ten years ago [[01:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=6587.679999999999s)]
*  Every tenth person you called to do a poll would answer now. It's about one in thirty people okay? [[01:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=6590.32s)]
*  And another important thing is that if you're a Democrat especially if you're a higher education level Democrat [[01:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=6597.28s)]
*  You're much more willing to answer pollster questions [[01:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=6604.0s)]
*  Where if you're excuse me if you're like my family if somebody called them a stranger and said here [[01:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=6607.72s)]
*  You know vote for they would say F you and hang up the phone [[01:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=6612.64s)]
*  Oh, right, so what the reason the polls has gotten so bad is because Trump voters are less likely to answer pollster questions and [[01:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=6616.2s)]
*  Kamala Harris voters are much more likely to answer pollster questions [[01:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=6625.320000000001s)]
*  So it's very hard to get an accurate sample to give you any sense of what's going on [[01:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=6628.64s)]
*  But now just believe that are you just saying that I actually yeah, no I believe that and I've seen it in my own race [[01:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=6633.24s)]
*  For example you know I ran for Senate [[01:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=6639.36s)]
*  There were all these public polls that say what you know the race was tied or maybe we'd even lose by a few points [[01:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=6641.5199999999995s)]
*  And the pollster that I had who just posed for my campaign [[01:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=6646.64s)]
*  He's actually Trump's pollster too and a very smart guy [[01:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=6650.88s)]
*  And he said look the reason these polls are wrong is because they're not reaching [[01:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=6654.0s)]
*  Voters who don't like to answer polls and those voters are going heavily for you, so I said okay [[01:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=6659.280000000001s)]
*  Well how much are we gonna win by and he said you're gonna win by six points and we won by seven points right? [[01:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=6664.400000000001s)]
*  So he was much more accurate than the public pollsters now you ask why is he more accurate because [[01:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=6668.240000000001s)]
*  Most of the public polls they cost ten twenty thousand dollars like if you see a poll published in a newspaper article [[01:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=6674.200000000001s)]
*  Ten to twenty thousand dollars to get an accurate sample these guys need to really it's it's sixty seventy thousand dollars [[01:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=6680.08s)]
*  Because they've got a call thousands and thousands of people to get a representative sample of the American people [[01:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=6687.8s)]
*  so honest like sitting here honestly yeah, I think [[01:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=6694.84s)]
*  That charts about right. I think that we've probably got about a 60% chance of winning [[01:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=6699.4800000000005s)]
*  I think the polls would have to be wrong, but they'd have to be wrong in a pro-comma direction [[01:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=6703.92s)]
*  we're normally they're wrong in a pro-trump direction and [[01:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=6708.72s)]
*  You know we've got 18 days 17 days man [[01:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=6712.08s)]
*  And we're just gonna like do everything that we can to win this race, but you shouldn't believe the polls basically yeah [[01:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=6714.96s)]
*  And I and I say this right now because the polls are all saying we'd win [[01:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=6721.44s)]
*  That's why that's why it's 57 43 don't buy the polls because here's the thing okay [[01:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=6724.84s)]
*  It could keep people from voting also it could keep people from voting, but let's say for example that something happened [[01:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=6730.72s)]
*  I don't know what happened, but let's say something happens with fire [[01:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=6736.16s)]
*  Yeah, where the people who don't want to answer pollster questions are [[01:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=6738.72s)]
*  Now common voters right so you can't trust this stuff you got to assume that you just got to work your ass off [[01:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=6743.6s)]
*  that's what we're trying to do you know President Trump, and I do in multiple events a day at this point and [[01:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=6750.68s)]
*  If you if you want in my view if you want to secure the border have common-sense economic policy [[01:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=6756.4400000000005s)]
*  Then Donald Trump is your man, and I say man something about Kamala Harris [[01:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=6762.72s)]
*  And I like I know a little bit about you, and I've read about some of your political views [[01:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=6767.4400000000005s)]
*  We've invited Mr.. Walls to come on [[01:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=6771.4s)]
*  Yeah, I'm sure I'm sure you [[01:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=6774.16s)]
*  But like they will but like Sean O'Brien [[01:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=6776.44s)]
*  Who's you know the head of the teamsters like one of the things that President Trump has sort of been known for is bringing more? [[01:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=6779.28s)]
*  Working-class people into the Republican coalition right it's I think one of the reasons why he's been very successful politically [[01:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=6785.48s)]
*  If you look at like where Kamala is on the big pharma stuff [[01:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=6792.16s)]
*  Look at where she is on the foreign conflict stuff [[01:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=6796.8s)]
*  She's like very pro-war or if you look at where she is on things like [[01:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=6799.04s)]
*  How do we how do we put tariffs on? [[01:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=6804.280000000001s)]
*  Goods that are imported from China so that you don't have the Chinese undercutting the wages of American workers [[01:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=6807.56s)]
*  Right like the illegal immigration thing like yeah, it's about fentanyl and drug trafficking [[01:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=6814.4400000000005s)]
*  But when you bring in millions upon millions of illegal immigrants who are willing to work under the table that undercuts the wages of American workers [[01:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=6818.280000000001s)]
*  Right so our own people get poorer, and I don't have anything against the illegal immigrants themselves [[01:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=6826.2s)]
*  I have something against Kamala Harris who lets these people come in [[01:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=6830.4s)]
*  But I want our people to be able you know black white brown whatever [[01:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=6832.92s)]
*  I just want our people to be able to work for a solid wage that doesn't work [[01:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=6836.7s)]
*  when you have people coming in like this well some of it is we have to have personal responsibility to as as [[01:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=6840.76s)]
*  People running companies to not hire I agree those people as well [[01:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=6847.76s)]
*  And so you have to have forced that side of it as well. I agree you got to do both sides of it [[01:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=6851.8s)]
*  I think we ought to make it harder to hire illegal labor [[01:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=6855.56s)]
*  We also ought to make it harder for illegal labor to come into the country in the first place [[01:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=6857.400000000001s)]
*  I agree both sides of it [[01:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=6861.240000000001s)]
*  I've got a matter [[01:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=6862.52s)]
*  But I think that's actually why we're doing so much better among working people is because they recognize like [[01:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=6863.320000000001s)]
*  Open borders not good for me right? [[01:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=6870.160000000001s)]
*  For me like this this stuff with farm is not good for me [[01:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=6873.68s)]
*  And so they have become more open to Donald Trump [[01:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=6876.740000000001s)]
*  And I think it's a very good thing because I think look man between Bobby Kennedy [[01:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=6880.6s)]
*  Me [[01:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=6884.88s)]
*  Obviously the president at the top of the ticket. I think we're gonna have such a cool [[01:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=6886.4s)]
*  Administration that's gonna try to tackle the big things and not just govern along these bullshit slogans anymore, so [[01:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=6891.599999999999s)]
*  Look, I hope that ends up being true because I think we'll do a lot of good if we win if you [[01:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=6898.36s)]
*  No matter what happens in this election. Would do you think you would run again in the future? I don't know man [[01:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=6903.08s)]
*  It's so hard to even imagine [[01:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=6909.719999999999s)]
*  Running for anything after this because I'm so obsessed with winning right now and [[01:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=6912.4400000000005s)]
*  You know like I put you certainly probably would do another term of the Senate [[01:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=6918.16s)]
*  But that doesn't come up for four more years because Senate terms are six years. It's like whatever run nationally again [[01:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=6922.1s)]
*  I don't know man. That's a big. That's a big thing. It's a big thing to put your family through [[01:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=6927.400000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I can imagine I've only I've seen it for two months three months now that I've been the VP nominee [[01:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=6932.04s)]
*  To run for that for two years [[01:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=6937.0s)]
*  My attitude is [[01:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=6939.320000000001s)]
*  Let's get Donald Trump elected and let's fix as much as we can because then [[01:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=6940.84s)]
*  then then I think the country will be in much better spot like I don't mean to sound like a doomer and [[01:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=6947.28s)]
*  Yeah, I actually really have thought about what I do more [[01:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=6953.76s)]
*  I haven't really thought about what I would do in 2028 no matter what but man if Kamala Harris is the president for the next [[01:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=6955.92s)]
*  Four years we have four more years of open borders four more years of not putting tariffs on Chinese imports [[01:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=6962.52s)]
*  Four more years of the crazy foreign policy that's pro-war all over the world [[01:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=6969.12s)]
*  I really do worry that the country's in a very very bad spot [[01:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=6975.0s)]
*  So I don't think too much about future politics. I just want to win this race [[01:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=6979.32s)]
*  How many times do politicians say stuff that's just on the trail and then when it comes time to actually get in office and do [[01:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=6983.64s)]
*  Stuff it seems like that person disappears [[01:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=6989.46s)]
*  Me hopefully not at all [[01:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=6995.16s)]
*  Some politicians definitely say one thing and then and then don't govern that way and in the private in the privacy of their actual office [[01:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=6997.639999999999s)]
*  I mean some of its negotiation right like some of it is okay [[01:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=7005.36s)]
*  So let's say you have a tax plan you where you want ten things to happen [[01:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=7009.099999999999s)]
*  But then to get the Democrats to vote for it you have to take out two of those ten things like that's just the [[01:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=7012.68s)]
*  Give-and-take of governance, but I don't think that's what you're talking about [[01:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=7017.5599999999995s)]
*  I mean what you do see sometimes is people who say something on the campaign trail [[01:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=7020.44s)]
*  Even though they affirmatively do not believe that thing at all and that's just that's not you just honesty. It's certainly not me [[01:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=7025.44s)]
*  It's certainly not Donald Trump [[01:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=7032.04s)]
*  They'd say what you will about Donald Trump [[01:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=7033.28s)]
*  But he just says what he thinks and I think it's actually one of the reasons why [[01:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=7034.84s)]
*  People like him a lot of people are gonna vote for him [[01:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=7038.16s)]
*  I think also because it's just the funny who he's the funniest dude they've ever had in there [[01:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=7040.42s)]
*  He is incredibly funny shit. It says is absolutely wild. He's got he's got a great sense of humor [[01:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=7045.2s)]
*  Can I tell you one story? Yeah, and then you have to go. I know I know I have to go soon [[01:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=7050.2s)]
*  I've got you know my my person over here. I understand [[01:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=7054.219999999999s)]
*  No, I know I'm gonna have dinner with my kids tonight, so it's a big deal Skyline chili and [[01:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=7057.9s)]
*  Nonsense, and we're doing Skyline chili in Middletown. Even if you have other chilling you just say that they don't want to tell me [[01:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=7062.74s)]
*  That's one thing. I don't care if you lie about nothing Skyline is good [[01:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=7068.379999999999s)]
*  Have you ever had Skyline of Skyline go straight to the basement? I know that brother [[01:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=7071.74s)]
*  I have had it. I respect it [[01:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=7077.259999999999s)]
*  I've had a wedding in Covington, Kentucky. Oh, yeah, I'm chilly. Yeah, that's that's a that's a good wedding man [[01:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=7080.900000000001s)]
*  This must have been good friends [[01:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=7088.660000000001s)]
*  Anyway, yeah, so so the first time not that they had met ever met my wife [[01:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=7092.14s)]
*  But the first time President Trump spent any like real time with my wife [[01:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=7097.1s)]
*  Did he for whether or not he didn't flirt with her? He's very sweet to her, you know [[01:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=7100.9800000000005s)]
*  Give her a big hug told her she was beautiful. He's you know, he's a very engaging guy [[01:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=7104.46s)]
*  Some of the media doesn't tell people about him that he's a very engaging guy very easy to talk to [[01:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=7108.58s)]
*  But it's so funny like my wife is super diplomatic. And so he asks her he's like Usha, you know [[01:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=7113.18s)]
*  What do you think about your your husband being involved in politics? And she's all you know, it's nice [[01:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=7118.94s)]
*  I like, you know supporting him. He really cares about public service [[01:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=7123.14s)]
*  Loves the people of Ohio just gives a very diplomatic answer and then he kind of chuckles and says yeah, my wife hates it, too [[01:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=7126.0599999999995s)]
*  And [[01:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=7131.9400000000005s)]
*  It's just like broke the ice perfectly and then she could actually have a conversation with him because she wasn't trying to like [[01:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=7135.02s)]
*  Talk to the president then she was just talking to a guy at that point [[01:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=7140.58s)]
*  Yeah, and he's just he's got a very very good way about him and he breaks down some very funny stuff [[01:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=7143.66s)]
*  He's funny as hell. That's the other night. That's good. Yeah, what was Tony Hinchcliffe helped him write that or not? I don't know [[01:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=7150.1s)]
*  It's a good question, but he's I'll tell you a lot of the stuff he just comes up with himself [[01:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=7157.62s)]
*  I mean the the line where he was talking about [[01:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=7161.66s)]
*  You know white dudes for Kamala. Oh, yeah [[01:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=7165.379999999999s)]
*  And he was like he was like I forget exactly what he said, but some of the effect of well, okay [[01:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=7169.78s)]
*  They're they're they're wives and their wives boyfriends are all voting for Trump [[01:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=7175.94s)]
*  I [[01:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=7180.3s)]
*  Like all good jokes, there's like an element of truth to it [[01:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=7185.1s)]
*  My best was any rubbed on lucky Chuck Schumer right there [[01:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=7188.46s)]
*  Squeeze a couple bucks out of the fucking insurance companies right there [[01:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=7192.7s)]
*  Do you think our voting poll do you think that our voting is fair do you think I do I do I'm gonna look at system [[01:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=7197.900000000001s)]
*  It's fair. I think we had some problems in 2020 [[02:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=7203.360000000001s)]
*  I think the biggest problem in 2020 is that big tech interfered in the election like I I really [[02:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=7205.3s)]
*  Can't believe that Facebook and Twitter when it was owned then that they they admitted to like [[02:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=7210.46s)]
*  Leaving certain things off and stuff. Yeah, not and not facing any charges [[02:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=7215.5s)]
*  They admitted to censoring American citizens weeks before an election, right? [[02:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=7218.9400000000005s)]
*  Yeah, yeah [[02:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=7224.66s)]
*  Yeah, if you'll have me back, I'll come back after we win and have a good conversation [[02:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=7227.02s)]
*  But you're always welcome in Cincinnati even despite your views on skyline. Hey, man. I respect that [[02:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8mmTDDqAs&t=7230.62s)]
