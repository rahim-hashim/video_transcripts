*  Since you came to Nashville, remember? Yeah, dude. That was cool, man. Thank you. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO6ARuOQL-s&t=144.24s)]
*  That's ruined a lot of me, but not all of it. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO6ARuOQL-s&t=150.64s)]
*  Yeah, I've been good, man. Just still slowly just getting over. I mean, my burnout was so bad. It's [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO6ARuOQL-s&t=154.72s)]
*  tough to say that to people because people don't know it. But like, I couldn't even sit through [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO6ARuOQL-s&t=159.44s)]
*  a conversation. Well, this is a conversation I did with this guy, Bryce Mitchell, where I could [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO6ARuOQL-s&t=165.28s)]
*  barely even talk. I mean, just got burnt out. So it's just been a slow, like, every couple weeks, [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO6ARuOQL-s&t=168.72s)]
*  I feel a little bit better. I got on some peptides and I got a lot of different vitamins and [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO6ARuOQL-s&t=177.04s)]
*  did that ayahuasca thing to try to get better. I mean, I was trying everything to kind of see [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO6ARuOQL-s&t=185.2s)]
*  what was going on. I was telling Bobby, it's time off. I was telling him yesterday. He was [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO6ARuOQL-s&t=189.6s)]
*  like, yeah, I gotta do this. And I was like, dude, you're saying the same thing everyone's saying. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO6ARuOQL-s&t=195.12s)]
*  And I was saying that like you and I were talking about it. Yeah. And I appreciate you hit me up. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO6ARuOQL-s&t=198.4s)]
*  You hit me up and say, hey, man, you remind me to take some time off to go do some things for myself. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO6ARuOQL-s&t=202.56s)]
*  But I said how like the comments were all like, yeah, Theo, go. We'll still be here. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO6ARuOQL-s&t=208.88s)]
*  Like, go get right. Yeah. The comments weren't like, no, you better not take off. The comments [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO6ARuOQL-s&t=212.72s)]
*  were like shocking the other way. Yeah. Why do you think we get that feeling then that we can't, [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO6ARuOQL-s&t=216.24s)]
*  that we have to keep going? What do you think some of that comes from? Some of us to drive within, [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO6ARuOQL-s&t=221.83999999999997s)]
*  like where it's like we had starvation mentality for so long, you know, that we're still like, [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO6ARuOQL-s&t=228.16s)]
*  I gotta work. I got a job. I got an offer for a gig. And you're like, yeah, those are, [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO6ARuOQL-s&t=232.39999999999998s)]

*  just go buy breakfasts, you know, and you're like, oh right. Yeah. I guess I don't need the [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO6ARuOQL-s&t=248.88s)]
*  continental. Like, like you gotta just convince yourself that you're, you're fine. That's a good [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO6ARuOQL-s&t=254.48s)]
*  point. I think some of that, probably some of that realization too, some of that slowly coming in [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO6ARuOQL-s&t=260.4s)]
*  to my own head, like everything's going to be okay. Yeah. I, yeah, I remember we get the continental [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO6ARuOQL-s&t=264.15999999999997s)]

*  And then she's sued in one. At that point, everybody had to be like, Hey, no more freedoms [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO6ARuOQL-s&t=321.44s)]
*  for you guys. They ruined it all, man. I used to love the freedoms because yeah, then anything [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO6ARuOQL-s&t=325.44s)]

*  I want to say like some, some of those like electronic double doors or whatever, you know, [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO6ARuOQL-s&t=445.28s)]

*  Or whatever. He just didn't read a soul. It was like closed. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO6ARuOQL-s&t=455.2s)]
*  It's like, yeah. And I guess the argument in court was that his soul wasn't showing up on [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO6ARuOQL-s&t=458.64s)]
*  those monitors. So it wasn't their fault. Yeah. I should have gone to church more. It wouldn't [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO6ARuOQL-s&t=462.72s)]

*  place and like, nah, he was Royden too. And they're like, fuck third, like Royden, you know how far [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO6ARuOQL-s&t=1752.4s)]
*  that 17 that had to give it to the number 17 guy. And I'm like, he didn't even finish the same day. [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO6ARuOQL-s&t=1757.2s)]
*  He fucking finished on Tuesday. He all came in the fucking, you know, through the palace on Sunday, [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO6ARuOQL-s&t=1763.2s)]
*  like I rolled up to the break, stop the night. He goes, man, I've lost. I don't know. And then [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO6ARuOQL-s&t=1769.1999999999998s)]
*  he's like tortoise in the hair, you know, as long as you finish, who knows this. He's not even a [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO6ARuOQL-s&t=1773.12s)]
*  cyclist. It's just a black guy and a chef's hat. He's an Uber Eats guy. And he's like, oh, [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO6ARuOQL-s&t=1776.9599999999998s)]
*  just get through the fucking play Royale. Did you see this? He saw Trump's back up. Trump's back up. [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO6ARuOQL-s&t=1782.9599999999998s)]
*  What let's play it hard on. No, if he got a heart, I mean, he's Trump in order. [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO6ARuOQL-s&t=1790.1599999999999s)]
*  Great and glorious again. I am tonight announcing my candidacy for president of the United States. [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO6ARuOQL-s&t=1795.68s)]
*  I love the breaking news at the bottom. Trump expected to announce presidential, but at any [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO6ARuOQL-s&t=1804.72s)]
*  moment, like, yeah, he just did it. Fucking ticker. Get with it. Ticker. You're fucking [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO6ARuOQL-s&t=1808.48s)]
*  behind the times. Yeah. Tickers almost like that autistic buddy you have a ticker. And that was [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO6ARuOQL-s&t=1812.6399999999999s)]
*  always a name they had for somebody that had autism or whatever ticker. Cause he's a tick ticker, [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO6ARuOQL-s&t=1818.72s)]
*  button, a button. Where is this? Tell them button. Mar a lago. It's Mar a lago. What do you think [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO6ARuOQL-s&t=1823.2s)]
*  about this? He's going to win, right? What do you think? I don't know. I don't follow politics at [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO6ARuOQL-s&t=1830.24s)]
*  all. So follow much either. It does. It is interesting because I like the tears of the, [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO6ARuOQL-s&t=1835.6000000000001s)]
*  of the righteous and man, this guy makes them flow. It's fun for me to watch their tears. [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO6ARuOQL-s&t=1840.56s)]
*  Even when you saw Dave Chappelle saying that, did you see that bit that he talked about Trump? [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO6ARuOQL-s&t=1847.1200000000001s)]
*  He goes, I'm not, I remember him before he goes, but when he was running, he goes, [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO6ARuOQL-s&t=1850.96s)]
*  I'm not going to vote for him. I'll vote for Hillary, but I don't like it. Yeah. You know? [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO6ARuOQL-s&t=1854.64s)]
*  Yeah. Do you see that? Can you find that clip, Zach, where he said the other day during his [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO6ARuOQL-s&t=1859.52s)]
*  SNL thing about what they, why people liked Trump, which is the original Trump now. Damn. So he's [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO6ARuOQL-s&t=1863.52s)]
*  eight years past where he was before. He was already old then. You think he's still fucking? [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO6ARuOQL-s&t=1870.96s)]
*  Yeah. I think one of his top goals. I think he's getting probably exomes and stem cells into that. [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO6ARuOQL-s&t=1876.72s)]
*  It's probably smart to take the four years off because then you extend, you know, your time being [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO6ARuOQL-s&t=1884.3999999999999s)]
*  at the top, you're on four off four, but that all four, you're still former president. Yeah. And [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO6ARuOQL-s&t=1888.8799999999999s)]
*  then on four again. And then your next four, you were just the president. So you really get 16 years [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO6ARuOQL-s&t=1894.8799999999999s)]
*  out of that if you run it right. And you get to bounce back and kind of like see whatever didn't [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO6ARuOQL-s&t=1899.36s)]
*  work. Maybe the first time. I don't know if in Trump's case, he's able to do that. You know what, [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO6ARuOQL-s&t=1903.68s)]
*  Trump, you should change the constitution to eight consecutive years. So that way you can, [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO6ARuOQL-s&t=1907.04s)]
*  you can do it eight full years this time. That's what Hitler did. That's what Hillary did. Rewrite [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO6ARuOQL-s&t=1911.68s)]
*  that constitution. Did he? Yeah. You've got that constitution. Anything goes. Did it in Ecuador [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO6ARuOQL-s&t=1916.96s)]
*  too. Rewrite the constitution. Damn. Yeah. Ecuador. Yeah. I knew a real liberal comic and she couldn't [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO6ARuOQL-s&t=1921.68s)]
*  understand. She was like, what the fuck? When Trump won and, and I was like, well, you've never [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO6ARuOQL-s&t=1928.16s)]
*  gotten under your limo. He's never gone to Dayton. These people are depressed and they're looking for [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO6ARuOQL-s&t=1932.48s)]
*  answers. You've never talked to them. You live in your fucking gated apartment building, you know, [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO6ARuOQL-s&t=1937.76s)]
*  where no one's allowed in. You have your fucking doorman wearing an SS outfit. Like you have no [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO6ARuOQL-s&t=1942.64s)]
*  idea what a human is like. So you're like, what? Like, right, right. You've sheltered yourself. [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO6ARuOQL-s&t=1946.88s)]
*  Yeah. The media went so far overboard and tried to discredit them that they eventually got caught [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO6ARuOQL-s&t=1951.68s)]
*  like just misleading the truth. Yeah. Remember that Russia thing never was anything. Not only [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO6ARuOQL-s&t=1956.24s)]
*  was never anything was invented by Hillary Clinton side. So let's just say she didn't know, [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO6ARuOQL-s&t=1960.88s)]
*  but it was invented by a democratic side and push. So then they never go, oh fuck, maybe we've got to [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO6ARuOQL-s&t=1965.44s)]
*  look at these liars over here. They just go, move past it. So it was like, if you're not going to [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO6ARuOQL-s&t=1970.0800000000002s)]
*  apologize, it's like, if you tell me you're going to pick me up from the airport and then you don't [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO6ARuOQL-s&t=1973.6000000000001s)]
*  and you never apologize, I don't think you're going to pick me up from the airport next time. [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO6ARuOQL-s&t=1977.2s)]
*  I can't trust you're going to do it. If you said, dude, I'm so sorry. My alarm didn't go off. It's [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO6ARuOQL-s&t=1982.24s)]
*  like, I can tell you're sorry. Yeah. But these people never owned up to anything they did. [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO6ARuOQL-s&t=1986.08s)]
*  And so it's like, I heard I was randomly in my car and I was listening to Trump on like NPR during [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO6ARuOQL-s&t=1990.6399999999999s)]
*  the state of the union address or something. And he goes, uh, this MS 13, this fucking group from [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO6ARuOQL-s&t=1995.28s)]
*  Mexico, there's like the drug dealers and fucking smugglers and goes, they're terrible people. [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO6ARuOQL-s&t=2000.6399999999999s)]
*  They're, they're, they're, they're gang members. Um, and they're rapists and you know, they're [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO6ARuOQL-s&t=2004.8799999999999s)]
*  terrible people. And then the headline, I was like, huh, I wonder how they're going to play [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO6ARuOQL-s&t=2009.1999999999998s)]
*  the headline. The next day is Trump calls Mexicans rapists. And I'm like, damn, it's not a lie, [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO6ARuOQL-s&t=2012.56s)]
*  but it sure ain't the truth. And eventually he did it so many times. We're like, we don't believe [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO6ARuOQL-s&t=2017.1200000000001s)]
*  you guys. Yeah. I think, well, that's one thing I think people don't believe the news anymore. [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO6ARuOQL-s&t=2021.2s)]
*  Some people still do believe the news and I'm not saying believe the news in favor of any person. [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO6ARuOQL-s&t=2024.96s)]
*  Yeah. I haven't seen that Chappelle monologue, but they're like, oh, it's not that's the minute. [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO6ARuOQL-s&t=2029.84s)]
*  I'm like, I guarantee it's not. Yeah. I've seen enough of these. Every time you see a [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO6ARuOQL-s&t=2032.4s)]
*  comic one too far, I'm just like, without watching it. No, he didn't. Yeah. But I think that's one [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO6ARuOQL-s&t=2035.68s)]
*  thing. That's what, that's the thing that I originally thought was fascinating about Trump. [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO6ARuOQL-s&t=2040.72s)]
*  I'm like, he's not a politician. He's not a politician. So he has the chance, at least if [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO6ARuOQL-s&t=2044.24s)]
*  it's possible, just speak real to get in there and, and do at least put shine of some sort of a light [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO6ARuOQL-s&t=2048.64s)]
*  on whatever we don't know. Yeah. Cause he's not one of the two sides. He's not part of the garden. [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO6ARuOQL-s&t=2055.2s)]
*  Yeah. It's too bad. He's looking out for himself and business interests too much. It's too bad. [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO6ARuOQL-s&t=2061.2s)]
*  You get any sort of an evil one in there. Right. And that if it would have been somebody else, [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO6ARuOQL-s&t=2064.32s)]
*  it could have been interesting. Bernie maybe, or somebody who's like, Hey, come on, we gotta help [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO6ARuOQL-s&t=2068.0s)]
*  people. Let's get these guys out of prison. Yeah. Just talking normal. Not like, and we're going to [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO6ARuOQL-s&t=2071.84s)]
*  take it. And we're going to go to the Washington and we're going to change it a little later. [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO6ARuOQL-s&t=2075.84s)]
*  It's like, fuck you. You ain't one of us. Yeah. Yeah. I think he got then, I think his, [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO6ARuOQL-s&t=2078.96s)]
*  I think at that point, something they just wanted to change. I think people like, fuck the system. [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO6ARuOQL-s&t=2083.92s)]
*  That's what they want. They want to fuck that. That's what I want. All these billionaires got [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO6ARuOQL-s&t=2088.32s)]
*  more billions during COVID when we're all suffering. I know who's doing that. And rich people [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO6ARuOQL-s&t=2091.2000000000003s)]
*  making rich laws for rich people. Yeah. I can't afford a lawyer when I get arrested. [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO6ARuOQL-s&t=2096.24s)]
*  They just have my retainer. So of course they're going to get off easy. Well, it does start to [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO6ARuOQL-s&t=2101.2s)]
*  feel in the world like we got to go to where they're doing it. We got to climb some walls. [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO6ARuOQL-s&t=2105.12s)]
*  We got to take care of business. Yeah, but it's not good. I feel like I used to feel like the [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO6ARuOQL-s&t=2111.12s)]
*  government was the best. I don't know if I feel like governments bought out right by the businesses. [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO6ARuOQL-s&t=2117.4399999999996s)]
*  They're one step down. The business put the government in charge to like keep us all [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO6ARuOQL-s&t=2122.48s)]
*  going. That's what it seems like. Yeah. Yeah. It's like owner and then the governance is like, [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO6ARuOQL-s&t=2127.36s)]

*  they'll get theirs too. You know, they'll make sure to get theirs, but they're not the real ones. [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO6ARuOQL-s&t=2135.6800000000003s)]
*  Right. They're just kind of a liaison now between big business and human, regular folks. [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO6ARuOQL-s&t=2139.92s)]
*  Yeah. That's what it feels like. Anyway, not to be a downer, but that's, [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO6ARuOQL-s&t=2147.6800000000003s)]

*  to support the freedom of comedy. Also too. You know, I always wondered if guys like Rogan would, [[01:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO6ARuOQL-s&t=3918.64s)]
*  uh, create a platform that people subscribe to, you know, that would be cool. I could see [[01:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO6ARuOQL-s&t=3924.08s)]
*  Segura doing it too. Like a $5 a month app on your, on your Apple TV. And you get a special a month, [[01:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO6ARuOQL-s&t=3930.16s)]
*  special a month, just content, just contents coming out. And don't worry. It's going to be funny. [[01:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO6ARuOQL-s&t=3936.3199999999997s)]
*  Cause the guy in charge is like, we want funny. Right. Will you have black people? Yeah, sure. [[01:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO6ARuOQL-s&t=3940.64s)]
*  We're booking funny people have everybody. Yeah. But we're not going to be, we're not going to be [[01:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO6ARuOQL-s&t=3944.3999999999996s)]
*  like, fuck, we haven't had a, I don't know, Arab comic in too long. Just get some open mic or [[01:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO6ARuOQL-s&t=3948.48s)]
*  like, they're not going to do that. No. So yeah, that would be great. And that's, I guess a lot [[01:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO6ARuOQL-s&t=3954.08s)]
*  of things get put on Rogan's shoulders, I guess, hypothetically, since he's such a force, you know, [[01:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO6ARuOQL-s&t=3960.08s)]
*  but yeah, guys like Segura or even if like a group of comedians partnered up and said, okay, [[01:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO6ARuOQL-s&t=3964.3199999999997s)]
*  let's create this platform. We'll each put a special on it once every two years. So you know [[01:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO6ARuOQL-s&t=3969.36s)]
*  what they say? Like you make money on YouTube, right? They said, look, if you see the, so if [[01:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO6ARuOQL-s&t=3974.48s)]
*  you're making money on YouTube and they're selling ads, YouTube is making money. Most of it, probably [[01:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO6ARuOQL-s&t=3979.36s)]
*  80, 90% of it. Um, which is fine. Whatever the kick some downs or incentivize you to put stuff up. [[01:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO6ARuOQL-s&t=3984.88s)]
*  But what have we just made our own platform and we put some up on YouTube and there this other [[01:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO6ARuOQL-s&t=3990.08s)]
*  platform where we get all of it minus some operating costs. We just get all of it. That'd be a lot of [[01:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO6ARuOQL-s&t=3996.88s)]
*  money. Yeah. You know, if we're making 10% of it and you can make, I so far three and a half million [[01:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO6ARuOQL-s&t=4002.16s)]
*  hits on that. I think I've made like 25 grand in ad revenue and that's 10% of what they're making. [[01:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO6ARuOQL-s&t=4009.2799999999997s)]
*  So what if I made two 50? Well, my specialty paid off, you know, [[01:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO6ARuOQL-s&t=4015.68s)]
*  that's true. Who's going to make maybe a few comics. The dreams out there. I don't have the [[01:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO6ARuOQL-s&t=4020.4s)]
*  wherewithal. Someone needs to put it in and I've mentioned it to some other comedians. I think it's, [[01:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO6ARuOQL-s&t=4024.3199999999997s)]
*  it's hard to make a platform that actually works well. Doesn't lag and shit like that. But [[01:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO6ARuOQL-s&t=4031.44s)]
*  right. I think you would get together. Cause say if you got, you know, if you get a million people [[01:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO6ARuOQL-s&t=4035.2799999999997s)]
*  to subscribe at $5 a month and they know they're going to get one ads, even free just come here. [[01:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO6ARuOQL-s&t=4039.2799999999997s)]
*  And then the ads come in just like here, but we get it all right. I guess I was thinking of [[01:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO6ARuOQL-s&t=4044.56s)]
*  something that just had specials on it. That too. That would also, even if you started with that, [[01:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO6ARuOQL-s&t=4048.96s)]
*  you just had specials, special a month for five bucks, a special a month for five bucks. [[01:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO6ARuOQL-s&t=4052.72s)]
*  You would need a lot of subscribers. Cause if you had 50 people wouldn't pay for it. Right. You'd [[01:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO6ARuOQL-s&t=4057.2s)]
*  have to have a, say if you get a million, right. Yeah. Which I think say if you had enough certain [[01:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO6ARuOQL-s&t=4061.12s)]
*  convenience, you could get them all to say, right. You could go by views. You could decide after the [[01:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO6ARuOQL-s&t=4065.2s)]
*  50 million a year, 50 million a month. Oh my God. Yeah. So then, oh no, five million a month. [[01:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO6ARuOQL-s&t=4070.56s)]
*  Oh, if you got a million people, $5, good call. Yeah. It was like, wow, too good to be true. [[01:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO6ARuOQL-s&t=4077.36s)]
*  And that's why you swamp math. That's why you need an accountant. That's why you need it. That's why [[01:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO6ARuOQL-s&t=4083.2s)]
*  you need it. That's why you need a Ari Shaffir Jew on YouTube. You gotta have a partner in crime. [[01:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO6ARuOQL-s&t=4087.92s)]
*  Yeah. But I 5 million a month. So that's 60 million a year. [[01:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO6ARuOQL-s&t=4093.92s)]
*  So now we're working on it. So then if you paid the comedian, say you gave each comedian, [[01:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO6ARuOQL-s&t=4098.8s)]
*  whoever's going to put their special on, you gave them $2 million. Right. Yeah. For their special. [[01:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO6ARuOQL-s&t=4103.360000000001s)]
*  And then you said also in three years, you get the special back. It's returned back to you. [[01:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO6ARuOQL-s&t=4108.400000000001s)]
*  You've always owned it. It's just sitting here. Right. And it'll sit here for a certain number [[01:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO6ARuOQL-s&t=4112.96s)]
*  of years. And then at a certain number of years, it'll go back to you. And then every month you did [[01:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO6ARuOQL-s&t=4116.56s)]
*  that. Split it up by downloads, whatever. And it's also, Hey, if people are coming here to watch [[01:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO6ARuOQL-s&t=4120.24s)]
*  specials, keep it up there. Right. Yeah. You can keep it up there as well. Sure. But you're [[01:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO6ARuOQL-s&t=4124.24s)]
*  getting less percentage on YouTube than here. Put it up on both. But I think then you would have a [[01:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO6ARuOQL-s&t=4128.5599999999995s)]
*  platform that kind of sets comedy free in a way. So that's a free, I mean, it would only be free. [[01:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO6ARuOQL-s&t=4132.88s)]
*  I mean, making $2 million would be a lot more than losing $180,000. Yeah. Please donate guys. I'm [[01:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO6ARuOQL-s&t=4136.5599999999995s)]
*  fucking so broke. Yeah. We're going to make a nice donation to it, man. Just to thank you for coming [[01:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO6ARuOQL-s&t=4144.08s)]
*  too. Oh, nice. And for your time. Um, I got some fifties. People donate 50 bucks. Some people don't [[01:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO6ARuOQL-s&t=4149.84s)]
*  even want it. I'm like, that's great. I get it. You don't have any money, but you want to be like, [[01:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO6ARuOQL-s&t=4155.28s)]
*  that was good. Here's something. I like those. Is there a strong support from the Jewish community [[01:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO6ARuOQL-s&t=4158.400000000001s)]
*  being Jewish? Do you feel like? I thought it might go negative and it's not in that it's been really [[01:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO6ARuOQL-s&t=4163.360000000001s)]
*  like people like, this is awesome. This is clearly reverential to our society, making fun in a fun [[01:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO6ARuOQL-s&t=4167.76s)]
*  way. You know? Yeah. What are the, what are the rules of that you can make fun of Jews or not? [[01:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO6ARuOQL-s&t=4172.64s)]
*  Like our joke about it. Cause it's, it's tone. If I'm like, I'm like, uh, if, if you like, I don't [[01:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO6ARuOQL-s&t=4179.52s)]
*  know if I say like, shut up, redneck, you know, you know, I'm joking. There's a tone behind it [[01:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO6ARuOQL-s&t=4184.160000000001s)]
*  where some red, some other guys like, shut up, redneck. You'd be like, Hey, Hey, no, [[01:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO6ARuOQL-s&t=4188.72s)]
*  you know, there's, there's like, you can tell a friendliness. So it's like, it's tough to tell. [[01:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO6ARuOQL-s&t=4194.4800000000005s)]
*  And even, I guess, and if a joke is good too, that helps too. If a joke doesn't go over, [[01:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO6ARuOQL-s&t=4199.2s)]
*  it seems more hateful than if it does go over. Like me, Brian Dorfman and I always tell Jewish [[01:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO6ARuOQL-s&t=4203.76s)]
*  church to each other. Right. And, uh, he, what is one of my favorite ones? It's like, [[01:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO6ARuOQL-s&t=4208.719999999999s)]
*  Oh, what did the one do? He's got to say, he goes, Hey man, I'm sorry to hear about the fire. And he [[01:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO6ARuOQL-s&t=4214.8s)]
*  goes, it's Tuesday. That's what happened. He has called Jewish lightning. The insurance. He's [[01:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO6ARuOQL-s&t=4218.719999999999s)]
*  talked about some strip club burning down on Sunday. He goes, dude, it caught fire. It burns [[01:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO6ARuOQL-s&t=4227.6s)]
*  so much that the bus stop outside on the, on the street, the sidewalk melted. That ain't no [[01:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO6ARuOQL-s&t=4231.76s)]
*  fucking fire. That's where they put too hard on it. Burn harder than nine 11, dude, which we also [[01:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO6ARuOQL-s&t=4236.72s)]
*  planned. Um, yeah, it's, it's a good one. That's one of my favorite. That's a good one. Every [[01:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO6ARuOQL-s&t=4243.280000000001s)]
*  lady from crackers. Uh, yeah. She, I, Tom Segura took me there. He goes, he goes, Hey, it's a break [[01:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO6ARuOQL-s&t=4250.160000000001s)]
*  even week, but you'll get you in, you know, if you want to come feature for me, uh, it'll just [[01:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO6ARuOQL-s&t=4255.68s)]
*  pay for your flight. But she puts you in a hotel, so that's fine. Okay. And she makes, [[01:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO6ARuOQL-s&t=4260.160000000001s)]
*  she started running with Jujo and she, I was on stage and she goes, should we throw quarters at [[01:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO6ARuOQL-s&t=4264.72s)]
*  him? Really? You give people the power to like, I go nuts. Yeah, that's true. Huh? That's [[01:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO6ARuOQL-s&t=4269.92s)]
*  interesting. Did, um, did they, did you feel like a lot of the Kanye stuff? Like did they, [[01:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO6ARuOQL-s&t=4279.6s)]
*  did you have people asking you about it? Oh yeah. I think it was probably miss mislabeled. [[01:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO6ARuOQL-s&t=4287.6s)]
*  What do you think is going on with Kanye? I don't think he's happy with his agents. [[01:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO6ARuOQL-s&t=4293.84s)]
*  He's saying literally legitimately, he's saying the same shit that I've said for years. [[01:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO6ARuOQL-s&t=4298.320000000001s)]
*  You call agents, your Jews, I've been just calling them a Jew. There's a lot of Jews in there. So [[01:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO6ARuOQL-s&t=4302.320000000001s)]
*  it's a colloquial, you know, right? My literal agent is not Jewish, but he's one of my Jews. [[01:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO6ARuOQL-s&t=4306.4s)]
*  And when he goes, I'm going Def Con on the Jews, he means he's going to fire his agents. He's just [[01:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO6ARuOQL-s&t=4313.44s)]
*  saying it and he's a, he's an artist. He's saying he's not just going to say, I'm going to fire my [[01:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO6ARuOQL-s&t=4317.04s)]
*  agents. That's not fun. I wish he'd do it through song. That's where he excels. Oh, you know, but, [[01:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO6ARuOQL-s&t=4321.04s)]
*  but like they're like these antisemitic statements like guys, he doesn't, they, [[01:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO6ARuOQL-s&t=4329.12s)]
*  they write a narrative and then they go like that narrative can't be wrong. [[01:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO6ARuOQL-s&t=4333.68s)]
*  So let's jump off from there. I'm like, I think you're jumping off ground might be wrong. [[01:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO6ARuOQL-s&t=4337.04s)]
*  You know, it's, oh, he's, Theo's wearing a purple shirt. So he's gay. So as a gay man sitting here, [[01:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO6ARuOQL-s&t=4340.72s)]
*  he has to do this. And I'm like, wait, you know, I'd be right about the gay part. Can we reexamine? [[01:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO6ARuOQL-s&t=4347.6s)]
*  Like it's a narrative. It's already set. Right. And so I just don't think he's that. And then [[01:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO6ARuOQL-s&t=4351.52s)]
*  you're pushing him deeper and deeper into like defending himself. You're pushing him to be [[01:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO6ARuOQL-s&t=4355.76s)]
*  antisemitic. He might've had one thought here or there, it's a little off and how you're making, [[01:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO6ARuOQL-s&t=4359.52s)]
*  who's coming down, who's coming down on them. The fucking Jews are coming down on them. So now [[01:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO6ARuOQL-s&t=4363.44s)]
*  you're the oppressor. I don't, I just don't think it's all that. I think Kyrie Irvin too. It's like, [[01:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO6ARuOQL-s&t=4367.12s)]
*  I saw a documentary. Yeah. We've all been there. Yeah. He saw a flat earth documentary too. And [[01:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO6ARuOQL-s&t=4372.0s)]
*  he liked that one, dude. I'll tell you this, the flat, I'll tell you how I even learned about flat [[01:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO6ARuOQL-s&t=4377.28s)]
*  earth. I met a pizza spot, Palm Springs, two black dudes roll up on me. They said, do you think [[01:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO6ARuOQL-s&t=4381.839999999999s)]
*  that that pizza is round or flat? That's what they said. Interesting. It's both. Right. And [[01:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO6ARuOQL-s&t=4387.84s)]
*  next thing you know, for one hour, I'm sitting in an Italian spot, listening to two brothers. [[01:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO6ARuOQL-s&t=4395.4400000000005s)]
*  Tell me about flat earth. I'd love to hear that. Here's my advice to everybody. When you meet a [[01:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO6ARuOQL-s&t=4401.84s)]
*  crazy person, do not argue with them. You'll gain nothing. You will not change their opinion [[01:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO6ARuOQL-s&t=4406.72s)]
*  and you will have lost the chance to hear their whole crazy argument. If you meet a QAnon person, [[01:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO6ARuOQL-s&t=4412.96s)]
*  you go, you're making some good points. What else you got? Just do your research. You won't get [[01:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO6ARuOQL-s&t=4418.4800000000005s)]
*  access like that. That's a good point. You know, if you, if you get fucking Mike Shanahan going like, [[01:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO6ARuOQL-s&t=4424.24s)]
*  can I tell you about some places like, oh no, those plays don't work. No, just go, okay. I'm here [[01:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO6ARuOQL-s&t=4429.44s)]
*  listening. Just listen. Yeah. So yeah, flat earth, by the way, literally every person I know, maybe [[01:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO6ARuOQL-s&t=4433.92s)]
*  outside Joe Rogan cannot prove to you that the earth is round. I think it's round, but I can't [[01:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO6ARuOQL-s&t=4440.64s)]
*  tell you why. I would not be shocked if it wasn't. Yeah. I'd be like, I would not be shocked, dude. [[01:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO6ARuOQL-s&t=4448.56s)]
*  Yeah. Who the fuck was Galileo? So I'm fine. He didn't even have fucking Spotify. That was one [[01:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO6ARuOQL-s&t=4454.88s)]
*  thing that I thought was interesting that Kanye said was about like history. Like the people that [[01:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO6ARuOQL-s&t=4460.4800000000005s)]
*  whoever owns the world or controls the world, writes the history. Yeah. That's fascinating, dude. [[01:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO6ARuOQL-s&t=4464.400000000001s)]
*  Cause I went to Cuba as a student. I went to Cuba and the bookstores there, they start with when [[01:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO6ARuOQL-s&t=4470.4s)]
*  Fidel and Che had control. Wow. And you can't get a book. You can't get it. That's like 1984. [[01:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO6ARuOQL-s&t=4476.16s)]
*  You rewrite the history in a, in Shanghai, Ho Chi Minh, excuse me. That's what they call it. [[01:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO6ARuOQL-s&t=4483.04s)]
*  They have, they, they call it the American war, not the Vietnam war. Cause like, this is just the [[01:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO6ARuOQL-s&t=4489.36s)]
*  Americans attacking us. We're just one of the, we just drove out the French and then we got a few [[01:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO6ARuOQL-s&t=4494.879999999999s)]
*  years and the Americans came in. Um, they call it the war war Rembrandts museum, something like [[01:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO6ARuOQL-s&t=4499.04s)]
*  that. And it's just about the American incursion. And it's like, Oh yeah, I guess you have a different [[01:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO6ARuOQL-s&t=4507.76s)]
*  angle on it than we do. Hmm. You were just living your life and suddenly some fucking round eyes [[01:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO6ARuOQL-s&t=4512.0s)]
*  showed up. Start pushing you around. Oh yeah. Weird. Yeah. It's interesting. Isn't it? It's [[01:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO6ARuOQL-s&t=4516.64s)]
*  interesting that like even in Rome, probably the Romans probably had the, the ability to write [[01:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO6ARuOQL-s&t=4522.32s)]
*  history. Yeah. And that's what they're doing now when the Rolling Stones rewrites a list of like top [[01:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO6ARuOQL-s&t=4528.48s)]
*  albums. They're like, well, it was all white albums with a few, but it's like, they actually make really [[01:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO6ARuOQL-s&t=4531.919999999999s)]
*  good music. We should re-examine that based on like, you know, if I had to write top albums, [[01:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO6ARuOQL-s&t=4536.959999999999s)]
*  it'd all be alt rock, you know, it wouldn't even be metal. Yeah. So I shouldn't be able to write it. [[01:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO6ARuOQL-s&t=4541.04s)]
*  Right. But if I was in charge, it'd be all arcade fire one through four, you know, I mean, then the [[01:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO6ARuOQL-s&t=4546.08s)]
*  killers four through eight, you know, yeah. So you need some other ideas in there. [[01:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO6ARuOQL-s&t=4550.639999999999s)]
*  Yeah. That's, that's sometimes what I think about Hollywood. Like that I felt about Hollywood is [[01:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO6ARuOQL-s&t=4556.8s)]
*  like, I would go into a lot of meetings, a lot of pitches and stuff. And it kind of felt like the [[01:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO6ARuOQL-s&t=4560.64s)]
*  people had this, it was like the same people over a while, you know, or the same mind, like not even [[01:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO6ARuOQL-s&t=4565.84s)]
*  the same mindset. Yeah. It's like, it's like, you don't want a diversity of, of, of experience, [[01:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO6ARuOQL-s&t=4571.84s)]
*  you know, like we need some black people. It's like, well, go get Ms. Pat and like, yeah, that's [[01:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO6ARuOQL-s&t=4577.360000000001s)]
*  not the kind of black we're looking for. And like, well, go find them. It's like, [[01:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO6ARuOQL-s&t=4581.280000000001s)]
*  it's not just like this. It was like, whenever we did this, not happening. It was like, we needed [[01:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO6ARuOQL-s&t=4586.24s)]
*  this one is it was the same list of minorities. And I'm like, guys, these, these aren't good. [[01:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO6ARuOQL-s&t=4589.92s)]
*  Yeah. You gotta go look, you gotta go to Houston and find Ali. I need a guy who has N word in his [[01:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO6ARuOQL-s&t=4594.88s)]
*  name. You know what I'm saying? Like I need somebody who's like, you know what I'm saying? Or I need [[01:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO6ARuOQL-s&t=4600.32s)]
*  somebody who's like, yeah, or somebody who's like, yeah, it just, I think that's one of the, been one [[01:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO6ARuOQL-s&t=4605.04s)]
*  of the things about Hollywood that I think puts us in a place like Quentin Tarantino. What did he [[01:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO6ARuOQL-s&t=4610.8s)]
*  just say? If you're able to find that out, Zach. Yeah. He, he just didn't interview where he said [[01:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO6ARuOQL-s&t=4615.28s)]
*  we're in the worst age of movies of all time. I agree. If you wanted to do a cop drama right now [[01:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO6ARuOQL-s&t=4620.48s)]
*  from the seventies set in the seventies, you couldn't show the reality of that. [[01:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO6ARuOQL-s&t=4627.92s)]
*  So you're showing a fake version of it, or you're just like, then do a cop drama set now [[01:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO6ARuOQL-s&t=4632.08s)]
*  because you can't show the reality. So then it's like, you ever watched like a show when you were [[01:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO6ARuOQL-s&t=4637.5199999999995s)]
*  growing up and all the cops like, shut the freak up. And you're like, all right. But you definitely [[01:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO6ARuOQL-s&t=4641.2s)]
*  didn't say freak a lot. Yeah. You know, it's like, all right, there's sensors. Now there's like sensors [[01:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO6ARuOQL-s&t=4647.44s)]
*  are even bigger. You can't just, I mean, when they did the comedy store show, uh, whatever that was, [[01:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO6ARuOQL-s&t=4652.0s)]
*  it magical was on. Oh, was that when Adam, he could die? No, he didn't die. Who died? [[01:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO6ARuOQL-s&t=4657.679999999999s)]
*  Um, it was about Mitzi and all that. It was like, so I'm dying up here. That's it. And then they, [[01:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO6ARuOQL-s&t=4664.24s)]
*  in middle of that, they had the me too movement and they go, well, let's show the women in the [[01:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO6ARuOQL-s&t=4668.88s)]
*  seventies being strong independent. It's like, well, that's not some of the show was just in [[01:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO6ARuOQL-s&t=4672.96s)]
*  the middle of it. They were like, Oh, this just got lame. Cause they're worried about fucking [[01:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO6ARuOQL-s&t=4678.64s)]
*  presenting a case instead of just like presenting the truth and something fun. That's what gets [[01:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO6ARuOQL-s&t=4682.400000000001s)]
*  concerning to me is, is, is Hollywood like, are we starting to get to a point where we're not even [[01:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO6ARuOQL-s&t=4687.6s)]
*  presenting the truth, the what's really happening, but also because we don't, it's the same type of [[01:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO6ARuOQL-s&t=4691.84s)]
*  people in there that we don't know what's, they don't have a firm, just like they don't understand [[01:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO6ARuOQL-s&t=4698.88s)]

*  been going through and they fucking crave TV, fucking cave TV, just fucking took it down. [[01:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO6ARuOQL-s&t=4722.48s)]

*  well, quit fucking picking on me. Like I, yes, I'm from the South. I like, I'm not that guy, [[01:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO6ARuOQL-s&t=4753.2s)]

*  them in a studio and some of them out there in the world. So if I meet some traveler in fucking [[01:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO6ARuOQL-s&t=4934.08s)]
*  Brazil and we're in the rainforest, I'm like, dude, let's shoot right here. This will be cool. [[01:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO6ARuOQL-s&t=4939.04s)]

*  here. This is a cool setting. It's not quite as good looking as a, as you know, a studio like this, [[01:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO6ARuOQL-s&t=4952.96s)]
*  but it has some uniqueness. And there's a, there's a, there's the original element of, of, [[01:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO6ARuOQL-s&t=4957.92s)]
*  of the rogueness of it. Yeah. There's that podcast. That's not a pie. Have you seen that podcast, [[01:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO6ARuOQL-s&t=4962.4s)]

*  is it, is it, do people look at being Jewish? Like, is it, cause there's also a thing where [[01:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO6ARuOQL-s&t=5166.0s)]
*  like there's like Jewish hate, like Jewish, like self loathing or whatever. Yeah. Self-hating Jews. [[01:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO6ARuOQL-s&t=5171.04s)]

*  it was the most interesting, unique take of literally any comic in my entire career. [[01:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO6ARuOQL-s&t=5198.88s)]
*  He was so good. I think he hated himself and he was, and he was presented that to the stage [[01:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO6ARuOQL-s&t=5203.76s)]
*  of a self-hating gay, didn't deny being gay, but thought he was evil for having these thoughts. [[01:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO6ARuOQL-s&t=5209.360000000001s)]
*  It was so honest. Well, is it, so is that something about, [[01:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO6ARuOQL-s&t=5216.08s)]
*  cause I'm just trying to think of there's stuff about Jews, about Judaism that I don't understand. [[01:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO6ARuOQL-s&t=5219.2s)]
*  So there's a lot of things, right? But is there something about it that like, [[01:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO6ARuOQL-s&t=5223.4400000000005s)]

*  But you do not want outside jeans. Is that looked down upon? [[01:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO6ARuOQL-s&t=5263.76s)]
*  Yeah. It's just like, you only fuck Jews, but then it's like, well, that's a limited gene base. [[01:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO6ARuOQL-s&t=5266.88s)]
*  You know? I mean, Iceland is even more limited and they have an app that shows if you're somebody's [[01:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO6ARuOQL-s&t=5272.0s)]
*  cousin. No. Yeah. Do you have to go to the app? So it's like, it's a bigger scale of that, but if [[01:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO6ARuOQL-s&t=5276.0s)]
*  you can fuck anybody, well now we've got all sorts of genes. It's like Ian Edwards bit, [[01:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO6ARuOQL-s&t=5281.92s)]
