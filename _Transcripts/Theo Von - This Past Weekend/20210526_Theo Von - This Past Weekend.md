*  Little black white. I mean his daddy was white and his [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jY-f5ROOANQ&t=31.979999999999997s)]
*  They pretended his mom was his mom was well [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jY-f5ROOANQ&t=35.6s)]
*  His daddy knocked up the woman that swept out the school bus [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jY-f5ROOANQ&t=39.94s)]
*  His daddy was our bus driver big Milford and he didn't [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jY-f5ROOANQ&t=44.22s)]

*  You know I grow a little bit lonesome it's like I'm [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jY-f5ROOANQ&t=614.18s)]
*  At home sometimes and there's nobody there, you know, and I'm not complaining. I'm not oh [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jY-f5ROOANQ&t=617.98s)]
*  What was me, you know, like I'm just thinking about it [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jY-f5ROOANQ&t=623.3s)]
*  You know when it's titty time of year, you know that this is when the calendar breaks out them boingos baby [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jY-f5ROOANQ&t=630.82s)]

*  Because yeah, I start thinking about that next chapter of my life and what it would be like [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jY-f5ROOANQ&t=664.7s)]
*  You know and get me a little offspring and get me a damn [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jY-f5ROOANQ&t=670.42s)]
*  You know get a little bird or something or get a damn, you know [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jY-f5ROOANQ&t=675.5s)]
*  Get me a couple living items [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jY-f5ROOANQ&t=679.7s)]
*  So when I come home something yells or barks or shits or something [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jY-f5ROOANQ&t=682.94s)]
*  You know I started thinking about it [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jY-f5ROOANQ&t=689.3s)]
*  Because one thing I realized isn't the pattern that I'm in it just gets it just gets old after a while it's not bad [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jY-f5ROOANQ&t=692.7s)]
*  But it just kind of [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jY-f5ROOANQ&t=700.34s)]
*  You start looking, you know, you wonder what else [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jY-f5ROOANQ&t=702.86s)]
*  Is there something else? [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jY-f5ROOANQ&t=706.5s)]
*  And it's not to be found I don't think in like worldly things like in a [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jY-f5ROOANQ&t=712.26s)]
*  Vacation or a [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jY-f5ROOANQ&t=718.18s)]
*  You know buy you some speakers for the car, you know get you a couple 22s or something [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jY-f5ROOANQ&t=721.02s)]
*  You know, it's not um, it's not the kind of thing that's you can solve by getting 14 azaleas [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jY-f5ROOANQ&t=726.22s)]
*  You know and I think it's figuring out how to be in a relationship and get into some real love [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jY-f5ROOANQ&t=736.06s)]
*  Where I can [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jY-f5ROOANQ&t=744.5s)]
*  You know get a little baby out of somebody out of some woman's body [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jY-f5ROOANQ&t=748.62s)]
*  And be like that [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jY-f5ROOANQ&t=754.18s)]
*  Because it also starts getting weird when like [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jY-f5ROOANQ&t=758.5s)]
*  All your friends have children that are all they're getting like older [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jY-f5ROOANQ&t=761.62s)]
*  And you're it's like [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jY-f5ROOANQ&t=767.78s)]
*  It gets a little like who's there, you know, you just don't at a certain point you there's nobody left there's the [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jY-f5ROOANQ&t=770.58s)]
*  You know, there's not as many [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jY-f5ROOANQ&t=779.14s)]
*  People to even call or do as much with in some ways because everybody's moved on or adapted in the different realms of life [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jY-f5ROOANQ&t=783.02s)]
*  so [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jY-f5ROOANQ&t=791.02s)]
*  You know, I think I've been thinking about that some [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jY-f5ROOANQ&t=793.14s)]
*  And [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jY-f5ROOANQ&t=796.98s)]
*  Then I start thinking about what it's gonna take for me to get to a place like that to get to be able to be [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jY-f5ROOANQ&t=799.22s)]

*  Because [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jY-f5ROOANQ&t=828.3000000000001s)]
*  Close frisbee is obviously a gateway drug. I feel like possibly to homosexuality [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jY-f5ROOANQ&t=830.3000000000001s)]

*  So I'm literally trying to get my penis at least enough [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jY-f5ROOANQ&t=1993.52s)]
*  So when I walk by the guys they don't look and see I don't have any penis that's not [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jY-f5ROOANQ&t=1997.16s)]

*  I was doing anything to get my body to really enjoy some blood flow [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jY-f5ROOANQ&t=2030.56s)]
*  and [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jY-f5ROOANQ&t=2035.44s)]
*  finally, man, I got I [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jY-f5ROOANQ&t=2036.48s)]

*  You know [[01:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jY-f5ROOANQ&t=4035.96s)]
*  I never used to really think I had an ego and then [[01:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jY-f5ROOANQ&t=4037.88s)]
*  Over the past years, I've definitely feel more like I do and I and and it's a ego is just [[01:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jY-f5ROOANQ&t=4041.08s)]
*  I hate it, man [[01:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jY-f5ROOANQ&t=4049.0s)]
*  You know, I hate feeling like i'm better than somebody or because all it does is separate me [[01:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jY-f5ROOANQ&t=4052.04s)]
*  And now in some instances you need your ego because it keeps you safe it keeps you [[01:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jY-f5ROOANQ&t=4059.56s)]
*  You know [[01:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jY-f5ROOANQ&t=4065.72s)]
*  If you can't swim your ego [[01:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jY-f5ROOANQ&t=4067.08s)]
*  Might just say man, we can't swim, you know, and that that could keep you living but uh [[01:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jY-f5ROOANQ&t=4071.08s)]
*  But I feel like uh, and the craziest thing is once you right when you start to kind of live within a certain [[01:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jY-f5ROOANQ&t=4078.6s)]
*  Comfortability of yourself it kind of changes [[01:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jY-f5ROOANQ&t=4084.58s)]
*  And that's the weirdest thing about life [[01:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jY-f5ROOANQ&t=4089.3199999999997s)]
*  You know, I find that once i'm right when i'm getting a little close to myself I [[01:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jY-f5ROOANQ&t=4093.3199999999997s)]
*  I run off [[01:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jY-f5ROOANQ&t=4096.76s)]
*  You know from myself, I mean I [[01:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jY-f5ROOANQ&t=4103.0s)]
*  I'm the one looking for myself and i'm the one hiding [[01:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jY-f5ROOANQ&t=4107.56s)]
*  And right when I kind of get a hold of myself and right when i'm just close enough to myself to just [[01:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jY-f5ROOANQ&t=4114.280000000001s)]
*  Hand myself that frisbee and that hampton in [[01:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jY-f5ROOANQ&t=4123.72s)]
*  Spa tub [[01:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jY-f5ROOANQ&t=4127.56s)]
*  I go underwater or I disappear, you know, I [[01:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jY-f5ROOANQ&t=4131.16s)]
*  Or I evolve it's just [[01:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jY-f5ROOANQ&t=4136.52s)]
*  I don't know more and more I realize that this whatever the body is and all of this is just some shell that we're living in [[01:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jY-f5ROOANQ&t=4140.4400000000005s)]
*  You know, this is just some [[01:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jY-f5ROOANQ&t=4146.6s)]
*  carrier [[01:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jY-f5ROOANQ&t=4148.360000000001s)]
*  For [[01:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jY-f5ROOANQ&t=4150.84s)]
*  The spirit that's inside of us, which is this thing that's actually doing some evolving [[01:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jY-f5ROOANQ&t=4152.84s)]
*  Um, I don't know I know that doesn't answer a lot of question but [[01:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jY-f5ROOANQ&t=4160.04s)]
*  Uh, and do I ever get caught up in the being the character myself I used to feel like myself [[01:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jY-f5ROOANQ&t=4165.64s)]
*  And now I think the thing that's made me feel less like myself is work [[01:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jY-f5ROOANQ&t=4173.8s)]
*  Work [[01:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jY-f5ROOANQ&t=4179.96s)]
*  You know, it's kind of weird when your dreams become your business [[01:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jY-f5ROOANQ&t=4182.2s)]
*  Because I don't like business [[01:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jY-f5ROOANQ&t=4187.56s)]
*  You know, I don't like it [[01:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jY-f5ROOANQ&t=4190.36s)]
*  It's sneaky and it's I feel like it's [[01:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jY-f5ROOANQ&t=4192.92s)]
*  I feel like it's selfish [[01:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jY-f5ROOANQ&t=4197.56s)]
*  Now that doesn't mean i'm going to stop doing business, uh, you know, it's [[01:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jY-f5ROOANQ&t=4203.24s)]
*  I don't know if i'm strong enough to separate myself from the systems that we have [[01:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jY-f5ROOANQ&t=4207.5599999999995s)]
*  That you know that run this kind of like the world that we're in and stuff [[01:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jY-f5ROOANQ&t=4212.6s)]
*  I don't I don't know if i'm strong enough to separate myself from them [[01:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jY-f5ROOANQ&t=4216.84s)]
*  But I used to feel a lot more like myself a few years ago [[01:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jY-f5ROOANQ&t=4220.5199999999995s)]
*  And i'm hoping that more of me comes back around [[01:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jY-f5ROOANQ&t=4226.04s)]
*  You know, I felt more angry. I felt more agitated [[01:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jY-f5ROOANQ&t=4229.64s)]
*  Which is interesting because [[01:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jY-f5ROOANQ&t=4234.76s)]
*  I [[01:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jY-f5ROOANQ&t=4237.8s)]
*  You know [[01:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jY-f5ROOANQ&t=4240.76s)]
*  You would think it would be the other way around [[01:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jY-f5ROOANQ&t=4244.04s)]
*  But yeah, I don't know I I don't [[01:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jY-f5ROOANQ&t=4251.16s)]
*  I don't know if I ever knew what was going to make me happy and I just kind of expected that if I got [[01:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jY-f5ROOANQ&t=4255.24s)]
*  You know somewhat popular or achieved some success that's actually a better word is success [[01:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jY-f5ROOANQ&t=4260.6s)]
*  Or what I deemed as success we all can create our own successes. I never really chose mine [[01:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jY-f5ROOANQ&t=4267.96s)]
*  I kind of just let the world [[01:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jY-f5ROOANQ&t=4273.400000000001s)]
*  Say oh these things make you successful, you know, uh [[01:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jY-f5ROOANQ&t=4276.92s)]
*  Obtaining things or getting [[01:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jY-f5ROOANQ&t=4281.64s)]
*  Getting wealthier or getting uh popularity [[01:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jY-f5ROOANQ&t=4283.96s)]
*  Popularity I never really kind of wrote down what some of my own successes were [[01:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jY-f5ROOANQ&t=4288.28s)]
*  My goals and stuff. So I was just kind of achieving the status quo [[01:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jY-f5ROOANQ&t=4293.72s)]
*  And so [[01:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jY-f5ROOANQ&t=4301.320000000001s)]
*  I'm not shocked sometimes that i'm left with [[01:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jY-f5ROOANQ&t=4303.320000000001s)]
*  the status quo reality that [[01:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jY-f5ROOANQ&t=4306.4400000000005s)]
*  Those things don't really make you happy [[01:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jY-f5ROOANQ&t=4310.4400000000005s)]
*  And that there's a lot more to it than that [[01:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jY-f5ROOANQ&t=4313.400000000001s)]
*  But I guess in some ways i'm also grateful that there's more to it because it still gives me somewhere to go, uh [[01:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jY-f5ROOANQ&t=4316.36s)]
*  To find some peace [[01:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jY-f5ROOANQ&t=4323.719999999999s)]
*  And i'm not saying that i'm not I don't have peace really i'm just saying [[01:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jY-f5ROOANQ&t=4327.24s)]
*  You know, I want to feel I want to always feel good if I can I know it's impossible [[01:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jY-f5ROOANQ&t=4330.679999999999s)]
*  But I want to get close to that [[01:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jY-f5ROOANQ&t=4335.5599999999995s)]
*  You know or always be kind of learning about myself [[01:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jY-f5ROOANQ&t=4338.04s)]
*  Um [[01:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jY-f5ROOANQ&t=4340.84s)]
*  So, I don't know if i'm answering some of this question or not [[01:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jY-f5ROOANQ&t=4343.32s)]
*  But I used to feel a lot closer to myself [[01:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jY-f5ROOANQ&t=4345.5599999999995s)]
*  This is the first time in my life that I felt really separate from myself [[01:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jY-f5ROOANQ&t=4347.32s)]
*  So I think part of me is just trying to figure out what's making me feel that way [[01:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jY-f5ROOANQ&t=4350.12s)]
*  um [[01:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jY-f5ROOANQ&t=4353.8s)]
*  Which is one of the reasons i've been on somewhat of a search for that sort of thing [[01:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jY-f5ROOANQ&t=4355.8s)]
*  uh [[01:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jY-f5ROOANQ&t=4360.12s)]
*  You know, sometimes I I think I want to [[01:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jY-f5ROOANQ&t=4361.32s)]
*  I don't know [[01:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jY-f5ROOANQ&t=4365.96s)]
*  Um, and then also you put a lot of yourself out there [[01:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jY-f5ROOANQ&t=4367.96s)]
*  With podcasting and comedy and sharing and then sometimes there's not that [[01:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jY-f5ROOANQ&t=4374.12s)]
*  It's not that there's not much left, but there's [[01:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jY-f5ROOANQ&t=4380.36s)]
*  I don't know [[01:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jY-f5ROOANQ&t=4388.36s)]
*  It's interesting man [[01:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jY-f5ROOANQ&t=4391.64s)]
*  You know, I remember going to china once and a woman didn't want me to take her picture [[01:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jY-f5ROOANQ&t=4394.280000000001s)]
*  And she said because it captured part of you and that once that happened you couldn't get that part of you back [[01:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jY-f5ROOANQ&t=4399.56s)]
*  And I wonder you know, I wonder if one day we'll see that [[01:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jY-f5ROOANQ&t=4408.84s)]
*  All this capturing of ourselves and of each other that we're doing that it [[01:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jY-f5ROOANQ&t=4412.84s)]
*  Like [[01:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jY-f5ROOANQ&t=4419.64s)]
*  Do de roads or d d erodes us or erodes us at some level that we don't know yet [[01:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jY-f5ROOANQ&t=4420.92s)]
*  You know, I would bet there's some truth to that [[01:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jY-f5ROOANQ&t=4433.0s)]
*  Because the chinese man they [[01:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jY-f5ROOANQ&t=4436.92s)]
*  You know good and well dude, they'll make a damn soup out of anything, you know, and so [[01:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jY-f5ROOANQ&t=4440.6s)]
*  They know a lot of uh ingredients [[01:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jY-f5ROOANQ&t=4446.92s)]
*  To the overall recipe I bet [[01:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jY-f5ROOANQ&t=4449.4s)]
*  But uh, thank you for the for the question and let's get um [[01:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jY-f5ROOANQ&t=4452.52s)]

*  Get paid to go get your degree and then do whatever the hell you want [[01:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jY-f5ROOANQ&t=4951.4800000000005s)]

*  What's happening? My name is trevor. I did [[01:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jY-f5ROOANQ&t=4961.96s)]
*  Almost six years in the army calling in to basically, uh [[01:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jY-f5ROOANQ&t=4966.2s)]
*  Give a little input answer for that cap that was asking. Uh, what should he do? [[01:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jY-f5ROOANQ&t=4970.6s)]
*  or expect [[01:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jY-f5ROOANQ&t=4975.96s)]
*  You need to start job hunting immediately even though you're still in the service [[01:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jY-f5ROOANQ&t=4977.64s)]
*  You can communicate with anybody that's specific [[01:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jY-f5ROOANQ&t=4981.8s)]
*  To what you've done in the military, you know, so that way you can transfer that flawlessly over [[01:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jY-f5ROOANQ&t=4984.84s)]
*  In the civilian world because it's a big change homie. So [[01:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jY-f5ROOANQ&t=4991.0s)]
*  There you go. That's a great one [[01:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jY-f5ROOANQ&t=4995.400000000001s)]
*  Yes, sir. What's up? This is calling calling and I wanted to share some ideas [[01:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jY-f5ROOANQ&t=4997.96s)]
*  But I figured most of the ideas would be like [[01:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jY-f5ROOANQ&t=5002.52s)]
*  Use the gi bill go back to school go live here because they paid well with the living stipend [[01:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jY-f5ROOANQ&t=5005.56s)]
*  um, but [[01:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jY-f5ROOANQ&t=5011.4800000000005s)]
*  What I want to share is that the one thing that I did not expect [[01:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jY-f5ROOANQ&t=5013.080000000001s)]
*  when I got out was how difficult it would be to [[01:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jY-f5ROOANQ&t=5017.64s)]
*  to reconnect with people and [[01:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jY-f5ROOANQ&t=5021.8s)]
*  I wouldn't expect everyone to have as difficult of a time as I did but [[01:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jY-f5ROOANQ&t=5025.400000000001s)]
*  Um, I thought I would have more people there for me and that's a sad thing to say but it but it also has the silver lining it's just [[01:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jY-f5ROOANQ&t=5030.84s)]
*  Know that and know that people are busy and people [[01:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jY-f5ROOANQ&t=5040.92s)]
*  Are struggling a lot. So the people that you might have thought you could rely on upon getting out might not be there [[01:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jY-f5ROOANQ&t=5044.84s)]
*  Well, that's a good point man that like yeah, sometimes things when you went in [[01:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jY-f5ROOANQ&t=5052.84s)]
*  Everybody might have been you know, finished in school and having a good time and partying and now when you're out [[01:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jY-f5ROOANQ&t=5056.52s)]
*  uh people's lives may have changed and [[01:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jY-f5ROOANQ&t=5061.8s)]
*  um [[01:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jY-f5ROOANQ&t=5064.84s)]
*  Their accessibility, uh [[01:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jY-f5ROOANQ&t=5065.88s)]
*  To help and to be a daily part of your life might not be there [[01:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jY-f5ROOANQ&t=5068.52s)]
*  Uh, here we go [[01:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jY-f5ROOANQ&t=5072.44s)]
*  Hey, tio, this is tyler from out here in la, you know that little valeria son here in kentucky [[01:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jY-f5ROOANQ&t=5075.16s)]
*  oh, yeah, and I went to a party over there one time and [[01:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jY-f5ROOANQ&t=5081.0s)]
*  Took a felon. He's robbed everybody over there and jumped off at a rooftop. Here we go [[01:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jY-f5ROOANQ&t=5086.92s)]
*  Anyway, i'm calling some advice for the military dude that just got out after five long years [[01:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jY-f5ROOANQ&t=5093.96s)]
*  So my advice would be to sit down and do some serious lifestyle architecture, right? [[01:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jY-f5ROOANQ&t=5099.16s)]
*  Like don't rush into a job immediately sit down really figure out what kind of uh, [[01:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jY-f5ROOANQ&t=5104.44s)]
*  Um, what kind of job? [[01:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jY-f5ROOANQ&t=5109.64s)]
*  Life you would like to have [[01:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jY-f5ROOANQ&t=5112.68s)]
*  Where you'd like to live what kind of family situation and housing situation you want going on all that shit first? [[01:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jY-f5ROOANQ&t=5114.68s)]
*  And then pick a career that can enable that [[01:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jY-f5ROOANQ&t=5120.84s)]
*  That you um, I guess could tolerate pretty much if you can find something you're passionate about even better [[01:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jY-f5ROOANQ&t=5123.64s)]
