*  Hey, this is how I said, you know, I used to have a joke in my show about [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEDDcjrkq_o&t=327.28s)]
*  There there was a story in the Bible about Jesus and the prostitute that's the that's the heading of the story [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEDDcjrkq_o&t=331.56s)]
*  Uh-huh, and you know the prostitute she gets her sins forgiven and she gets saved and all this kind of stuff. She's [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEDDcjrkq_o&t=337.2s)]

*  The process. Oh, what's up? [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEDDcjrkq_o&t=349.96s)]
*  Like she did she get a name Wow she gets no name so in the Bible they didn't even give her a name [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEDDcjrkq_o&t=352.59999999999997s)]
*  No, but there's a but that's not gender specific. There's like Jesus and the man with leprosy. He's like dude. I had a nice job [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEDDcjrkq_o&t=357.91999999999996s)]
*  I had a family. I right I had more than leprosy [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEDDcjrkq_o&t=363.41999999999996s)]
*  But for the book, it's like we just need you to be leprosy. We need you to be leprosy one [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEDDcjrkq_o&t=366.76s)]
*  Need prostitute one we need leprosy one [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEDDcjrkq_o&t=372.67999999999995s)]
*  What's it called when you do a TV show and then somebody's in the background doing something like hey, can you oh, yeah release [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEDDcjrkq_o&t=374.78s)]
*  There was no release at the back in the Bible times about leprosy guys like hey, we're just gonna right [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEDDcjrkq_o&t=380.06s)]
*  We're just gonna take your story bro and leprosy was pretty popular. I think for a while [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEDDcjrkq_o&t=384.62s)]
*  You know, but if you were if you were if you had it it was [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEDDcjrkq_o&t=390.1s)]
*  It was bad. No, you're out you can't oh you can't party with leprosy. No, no, no, no, but I don't even know if that's how it was [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEDDcjrkq_o&t=393.5s)]
*  Transmitted but that in you know, they're just like you're cast out if you got the I don't what is it? [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEDDcjrkq_o&t=400.26s)]
*  What do you think it is a scab or something party? [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEDDcjrkq_o&t=403.82s)]
*  I think it was like a little something and then your whole body got like your leg like fall off [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEDDcjrkq_o&t=405.66s)]
*  You would shed a limb. Yeah, you want to look that up, please Sean leprosy bring up a limb shedding [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEDDcjrkq_o&t=411.98s)]
*  What is it? But when you talk about something bad in the Bible like dude, he probably probably had leprosy [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEDDcjrkq_o&t=417.62s)]
*  infectious disease called by basilis [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEDDcjrkq_o&t=423.94000000000005s)]
*  So I don't know who he is that who that is. Is he? [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEDDcjrkq_o&t=427.02000000000004s)]
*  Transmitted via droplets that sounds familiar. Yeah [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEDDcjrkq_o&t=430.3s)]
*  Nose from the nose of the mouth. No masks back then bro. Wow [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEDDcjrkq_o&t=434.06s)]
*  The basilis is likely transmitted via droplets. Yeah, it's curable with therapy [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEDDcjrkq_o&t=439.42s)]
*  there were there were [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEDDcjrkq_o&t=445.94s)]
*  202,000 registered cases of leprosy in 2019. What if you called a girl? Hey, I can't come over tonight. Why not? [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEDDcjrkq_o&t=449.26000000000005s)]
*  got leprosy [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEDDcjrkq_o&t=456.82000000000005s)]
*  That would be like I mean it says right there 202,000 case plausible, but it's not I guess it doesn't it's not a death sentence now [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEDDcjrkq_o&t=458.7s)]
*  It's plausible [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEDDcjrkq_o&t=465.7s)]
*  But if you if you were like you walking into something and you rolled an ankle back in the Bible, you're like, that's it [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEDDcjrkq_o&t=467.26s)]
*  That's it. That's it if you rolled an egg. Yeah, like you walk in with a limp the rest of your that's it [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEDDcjrkq_o&t=472.98s)]
*  well, we forget, you know, I I [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEDDcjrkq_o&t=478.82s)]
*  Will romanticize things a lot of times and think man [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEDDcjrkq_o&t=481.14s)]
*  You know, it'd be so nice to be on a carriage with my wife or with some like, you know, yeah [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEDDcjrkq_o&t=484.42s)]
*  Yeah, and like old times like old times. I'll do that a lot. Yeah [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEDDcjrkq_o&t=489.5s)]
*  Yeah, and then you start to think like what old times were really like and it was probably pretty sad [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEDDcjrkq_o&t=493.3s)]
*  Oh, well, you don't even have to go back that far to like if you think about like dude when you were a kid [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEDDcjrkq_o&t=499.26s)]
*  Remember going to pick someone up at the airport [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEDDcjrkq_o&t=505.42s)]
*  You just like I hope they're here. Oh, yeah, and you'd go around [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEDDcjrkq_o&t=508.66s)]

*  There's no cell phones. You just [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEDDcjrkq_o&t=520.42s)]
*  When you would keep going? Yeah, maybe you stay for 30 minutes and then if you were there with your dad [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEDDcjrkq_o&t=523.06s)]
*  He'd send you in hey run in there and see on the on the screen. Yeah, it's here and [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEDDcjrkq_o&t=527.18s)]

*  being curious [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEDDcjrkq_o&t=1502.26s)]
*  Versus a boy and an uncle because he knows right and then that's a problem. That's trauma [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEDDcjrkq_o&t=1504.4199999999998s)]
*  Right when you have the knowledge when one of them knows and is trying to do a thing [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEDDcjrkq_o&t=1510.06s)]
*  First of it's too like because and then kids get in trouble for stuff that is just curious, right? [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEDDcjrkq_o&t=1514.1799999999998s)]

*  I thought I was you're supposed to be a Christian and you're streaking like that's just [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEDDcjrkq_o&t=1523.6s)]

*  Yeah, switch it. Oh, I don't think that was [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEDDcjrkq_o&t=1536.94s)]

*  Some family members one time or semi family and the kids over there in a bed, you know naked [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEDDcjrkq_o&t=1548.34s)]

*  That governor inside of your head for what's okay sexually can certainly get altered [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEDDcjrkq_o&t=1576.46s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, and get uh and get weird and get yeah, like when I think of those Duggar kids like the [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEDDcjrkq_o&t=1581.42s)]

*  Yeah, but they're like [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEDDcjrkq_o&t=1604.5800000000002s)]
*  That seems like a good wholesome thing, but they get it got it got twisted up, right? [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEDDcjrkq_o&t=1606.8600000000001s)]
*  There's lots of stuff there [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEDDcjrkq_o&t=1611.0600000000002s)]
*  But how I think could you not at this point you have children the age is so different 19 kids and counting [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEDDcjrkq_o&t=1612.18s)]
*  So you have kids? I mean you can't even reach a light switch without touching another kid's breast [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEDDcjrkq_o&t=1617.74s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? Like you can't even there's just there's not 19 showers in that house. I know that there's not 19 [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEDDcjrkq_o&t=1622.78s)]
*  Everyone can't get a hot shower. Right. Let's just that's just the facts [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEDDcjrkq_o&t=1628.86s)]

*  Yeah, which is first of all really normal for kids [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEDDcjrkq_o&t=1639.24s)]
*  But then it can get weird when one of the kids is now is 16 and one of the kids is five [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEDDcjrkq_o&t=1641.26s)]
*  It can get a little bit weird [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEDDcjrkq_o&t=1645.82s)]
*  So if you say like cuz then it wasn't there a lot of like incest and stuff going on there [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEDDcjrkq_o&t=1646.78s)]

*  a [[01:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEDDcjrkq_o&t=4758.22s)]

*  Someone that's a parent someone that's age some kind of someone that [[01:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEDDcjrkq_o&t=4765.58s)]
*  Like yeah, this was even steven. Yeah, so then yeah. Yeah, yeah, which is which is also tricky because [[01:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEDDcjrkq_o&t=4769.9s)]
*  Once you come into power or you come into influence or you come into something right then it's already automatically granted that without even realizing it [[01:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEDDcjrkq_o&t=4778.62s)]
*  That's maybe they should it just should come with like hey you got [[01:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEDDcjrkq_o&t=4787.74s)]
*  It also comes with this so just be like you don't know when the transition happens [[01:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEDDcjrkq_o&t=4791.5s)]
*  Like oh now I remember jay more talking about uh, right you're like now do women like me just like is it? [[01:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEDDcjrkq_o&t=4795.34s)]

*  They should send you a mailer or something that says hey bubba now you're different now [[01:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEDDcjrkq_o&t=4805.740000000001s)]

*  If the chili server [[01:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEDDcjrkq_o&t=4814.54s)]
*  Hooks up with the other chili server [[01:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEDDcjrkq_o&t=4817.18s)]

*  Hooks up with the waitress which happens all the time [[01:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEDDcjrkq_o&t=4830.700000000001s)]
*  Maybe that's not a good example, but like it then yeah, then you that you can't that's an imbalance [[01:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEDDcjrkq_o&t=4833.74s)]
*  I can't do that because you because she's if you say hey, do you want to come over? She's your you're her boss [[01:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEDDcjrkq_o&t=4837.74s)]

*  That's the tough thing about being a comedian. You're doing yeah, because you're like [[01:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEDDcjrkq_o&t=5058.62s)]
*  It's tough to be empathetic [[01:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEDDcjrkq_o&t=5062.94s)]
*  But also want to be able to just rip on stuff and be funny and be a sports fan and be up and be [[01:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEDDcjrkq_o&t=5064.46s)]
*  Bill burr said that you remember burr crasher asked him if he ever wanted to meet the president. He said no [[01:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEDDcjrkq_o&t=5070.3s)]

*  So there's so much stuff to be empathetic for that you almost get exhausted that you can't be like the the refugees [[01:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEDDcjrkq_o&t=5102.46s)]

*  Feels good to them to connect with somebody [[01:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEDDcjrkq_o&t=5128.7s)]

*  Something that happened generations ago. Um, my my my buddy isaac [[01:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEDDcjrkq_o&t=5895.42s)]
*  When I was home schooled first eighth grade, then I went to private school [[01:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEDDcjrkq_o&t=5900.3s)]

*  And I never no one ever said that to me in my house [[01:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEDDcjrkq_o&t=5918.3s)]
*  No one ever said john. I love you. No, it just wasn't [[01:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEDDcjrkq_o&t=5921.900000000001s)]
*  Did my parents love me? Yeah, my parent my mom said she when I was in rehab [[01:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEDDcjrkq_o&t=5925.82s)]
*  She I said she said she would give her life for me. She said that to me and I believe that right and she would [[01:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEDDcjrkq_o&t=5929.74s)]
*  but [[01:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEDDcjrkq_o&t=5936.54s)]
*  Does that make sense? I never I go how come and you get a little bit of a scar maybe because you're like [[01:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEDDcjrkq_o&t=5937.66s)]
*  What why didn't you tell me that? [[01:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEDDcjrkq_o&t=5943.34s)]
*  Yeah, but their parents never that right? They don't know. Yeah, they don't know [[01:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEDDcjrkq_o&t=5945.66s)]
*  But so here's the thing then if you have children you could tell you know [[01:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEDDcjrkq_o&t=5949.9800000000005s)]
*  Get specific with them sometimes but how you feel if you think that they may not know [[01:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEDDcjrkq_o&t=5953.58s)]
*  And because I think in my house, I think my mom always just assumed we knew also that of course [[01:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEDDcjrkq_o&t=5958.299999999999s)]
*  We love you the oh, right. Of course. I love you. Of course. We're a family unit [[01:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEDDcjrkq_o&t=5963.5s)]

*  By default look at all these people there at my shows, right? Surely [[01:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEDDcjrkq_o&t=5983.66s)]
*  And then what's odd what's very odd was like our relationship is like you burn your life to the ground [[01:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEDDcjrkq_o&t=5988.139999999999s)]
*  And that's when your parents show up [[01:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEDDcjrkq_o&t=5994.3s)]
*  But they to be fair they came to every comedy show they could within [[01:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEDDcjrkq_o&t=5996.54s)]
*  Six hours they will come to they they you know what i'm saying? [[01:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEDDcjrkq_o&t=5999.66s)]

*  It's interesting to have somebody else to talk to about this kind of stuff, you know, so [[01:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEDDcjrkq_o&t=6013.9s)]
*  I just want to say I appreciate you man. I appreciate you being willing to [[01:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEDDcjrkq_o&t=6017.9s)]
