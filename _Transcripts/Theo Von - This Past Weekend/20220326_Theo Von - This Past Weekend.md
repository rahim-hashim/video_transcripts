*  Today's guest is Jelly Roll. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=26.04s)]
*  Bender it is, baby. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=56.08s)]
*  What is the song? [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=63.08s)]
*  Dead Man Walkin'. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=67.08s)]
*  It's the number five song on rock radio. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=68.08s)]
*  It's called Dead Man Walkin'. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=71.08s)]
*  It's fucking crazy. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=72.08s)]
*  I've never had a song on radio, ever. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=73.08s)]
*  Gang, baby. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=74.08s)]
*  So, yeah, it's big shit. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=75.08s)]
*  Is that crazy? [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=76.08s)]
*  It's weird, but in a cool way. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=77.08s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=79.08s)]
*  As a kid, I don't care who you are, especially my age group, you dream of having a song on [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=80.08s)]
*  radio. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=85.12s)]
*  So having one on the radio is like surreal. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=86.12s)]
*  You know, that is kind of a thing. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=88.12s)]
*  When you're young, man, and you hear that radio, it always seemed like it would be impossible [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=90.12s)]
*  to get your song to come out of it, I bet. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=95.12s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=97.12s)]
*  Imagine being a little white trash kid like me and you, and you're wondering how it's [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=98.12s)]
*  coming through the radio anyways. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=101.12s)]
*  You're looking around like there's no cord on the car. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=102.12s)]
*  How is this even coming through right now? [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=105.12s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=107.12s)]
*  It's almost like they were sitting inside of your motor and playing for you personally. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=108.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=112.12s)]
*  Dude, I used to have a dream that at one point in automobiles, they would have a disc or [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=113.16000000000001s)]
*  something you'd put into the dashboard. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=120.16000000000001s)]
*  Right. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=122.16000000000001s)]
*  And then the band, they'd have like hologram. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=123.16000000000001s)]
*  I always had this vision that hologram was really going to pop off. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=125.16000000000001s)]
*  And the band would come out onto your dashboard the way it would be built, and the band would [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=128.16s)]
*  perform right there for you. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=133.16s)]
*  Right there. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=134.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=135.16s)]
*  God, we should still make that. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=136.16s)]
*  That could make money. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=137.16s)]
*  We could make some wrecks. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=138.16s)]

*  That's TikTok, look man, when you don't have a family or nothing bro [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=739.0s)]
*  You TikTok at night by yourself and you come across a little four track [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=742.0s)]
*  Sadly, TikTok's so popular now, you do that when you have a family [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=746.0s)]
*  Yeah, oh dang it [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=749.0s)]
*  They're sad, some nights I lay in the white from my bed [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=751.0s)]
*  We're just watching two separate TikTok feeds [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=754.0s)]
*  You guys are just sitting there just inadvertently hooked on Walker Hayes' TikToks [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=756.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's true, it's like hell, I'm just watching Fancy Like on repeat [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=761.0s)]
*  Like I'm being, like I'm finally getting punished for my sins of life [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=766.0s)]
*  Oh, especially since they're talking about Applebee's [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=770.0s)]
*  I bet they get too bent out, maybe some of them lyrics [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=772.0s)]
*  Oh dude, fucking milkshakes [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=775.0s)]
*  How do I find music? I know dude, but the Oreo shakes [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=777.0s)]
*  How do I find some music? That's probably how [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=781.0s)]
*  Actually my buddy, I was telling you that story, my buddy [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=784.0s)]
*  Back in the day when you would just, you know, ejaculating was a big thing [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=789.0s)]
*  Now it's kind of like all over the place, it feels like so much pornography [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=794.0s)]
*  Back in the day you had to really, I remember we'd buy a drawing of some cooter or something for the weekend [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=798.0s)]
*  We had this dude Nicky would sell us a little sketch, just a little bit of cooter for the weekend [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=804.0s)]
*  And we'd take that bitch home on Friday and bring it back on Monday, you know, because you got $2 back if you brought it back [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=809.0s)]
*  Yeah, you had to piece your own magazine together [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=815.0s)]
*  Where this guy had a page from this one and this guy had a page from this one [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=817.0s)]
*  You'd take three, four pages and tape them together, be your own kind of magazine [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=820.0s)]
*  One would be a hustler, one would be a playboy [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=824.0s)]
*  It actually had three, yarn, keeping it together, you're like this is dicey [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=826.0s)]
*  This is my shit [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=829.0s)]
*  But my buddy Scott would put a map up in his car, he's riding with his folks one time [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=830.0s)]
*  He puts a map up in the car [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=834.0s)]
*  Because at that age if you start masturbating, that's the thing, it gets you hooked, the devil gets you hooked on your own dick [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=836.0s)]
*  And you just start, bro, you're sitting there, man [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=842.0s)]
*  And my buddy Scott did it, he was just telling his family where they were going [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=845.0s)]
*  And the whole time he's behind this map [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=849.0s)]
*  Just one, two, three, four pages [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=852.0s)]
*  Just ruining Maine, that's all he was doing, bro [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=854.0s)]
*  And I thought I was a gangster because I could pull it sometimes if my cellmate was asleep when I was in jail [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=857.0s)]
*  And even then I felt pretty sketchy because there was another grown man there [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=863.0s)]
*  But could you imagine just having a car pulled, dude? [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=866.0s)]
*  Your sister's in the backseat kicking the seat [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=869.0s)]
*  Dude, that's family food [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=871.0s)]
*  Where's Steve Harvey when that shit's going down, you know? [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=872.0s)]
*  Bring that question up [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=875.0s)]
*  You're over there adding tributaries to your own freaking map [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=876.0s)]
*  So take me through, man, so how did you get into music, man? [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=881.0s)]
*  How did it start for you when you're coming up? [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=884.0s)]
*  Where does the music hit you first in your life? [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=887.0s)]
*  My mother was probably like [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=890.0s)]
*  The sad part of the story is my mother always struggled with [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=894.0s)]
*  Mental health issues and addiction [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=898.0s)]
*  And she didn't leave much at all when I was a kid, she was a recluse [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=900.0s)]
*  She never really left the house [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=903.0s)]
*  And she would like, her making it to the kitchen table was kind of like a big deal, you know? [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=905.0s)]
*  Yeah [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=910.0s)]
*  And you'd walk in the house and mom would be at the kitchen table [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=911.0s)]
*  And she'd have a cigarette lit [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=914.0s)]
*  And she'd be sitting on a wood chair, Indian style, right there in the kitchen back when you could smoke [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=916.0s)]
*  Back when restaurants had smoking sections [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=920.0s)]
*  Oh yeah [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=922.0s)]
*  Smoking inside places was a thing, you know? [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=923.0s)]
*  And she'd be there smoking a cigarette and she'd have a record playing [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=926.0s)]
*  And she'd just have her eyes closed [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=930.0s)]
*  And I just, I could tell that the music was doing something to her, man [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=932.0s)]
*  Like, I just remember watching her and thinking, man, this music's like [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=936.0s)]
*  Whatever that is is helping her, you know? [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=940.0s)]
*  Or she'd play like Bette Midler the Rose and cry [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=944.0s)]
*  I could still hear in my head, play this at my funeral until this day [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=947.0s)]
*  If you play Bette Midler the Rose right now, I might tear up [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=950.0s)]
*  And she'd be like, play this at my funeral, Jelly, play this at my funeral, Baby Jason [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=953.0s)]
*  And she'd just smoke a cigarette [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=957.0s)]
*  And I just remember thinking, man, I want to make people feel the way this makes my mother feel [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=958.0s)]
*  That's the songwriting aspect of it, right? [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=964.0s)]
*  That was what ignited the songwriter in me [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=967.0s)]
*  Now, the influences are cool because I was the baby, right? [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=971.0s)]
*  I was the youngest [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=975.0s)]
*  How many? [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=976.0s)]
*  Two brothers, one sister, and my sister, who she's still with to this day, was with then [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=977.0s)]
*  So she's been with this man 30-something years [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=981.0s)]
*  He pretty much lived with us from her high school years up [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=983.0s)]
*  So I say I had three brothers [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=985.0s)]
*  Two brothers, a brother-in-law that lived with us and a sister [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=987.0s)]
*  And we always had some broke cousin on the couch [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=989.0s)]
*  Or some broke family in the living room with blow-up mattresses or something [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=992.0s)]
*  This was just like... [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=997.0s)]
*  Like future convict [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=998.0s)]
*  Yeah, this is our current convict or somebody on the run from the police [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=999.0s)]
*  We had that kind of a house [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=1002.0s)]
*  And we would like... [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=1004.0s)]
*  Yeah, when hide and go seek was hide and go seek [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=1006.0s)]
*  Yeah, for sure [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=1008.0s)]
*  I'll tell you a story about that in a second, it's even better [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=1009.0s)]
*  But when I got in the car with anybody, because I was the baby [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=1011.0s)]
*  I had no fucking control of the radio dial [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=1015.0s)]
*  I was the last motherfucker that got to pick the radio [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=1017.0s)]
*  Oh yeah, and it was so important [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=1020.0s)]
*  That was it [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=1022.0s)]
*  Who got to pick the radio? [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=1023.0s)]
*  Who got to pick the radio, right? [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=1024.0s)]
*  So it's like when I was in the car [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=1026.0s)]
*  I had one brother that listened to nothing but gangster rap [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=1028.0s)]
*  And his bizzle sitting here is awesome because he's met my whole family [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=1030.0s)]
*  Yeah [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=1033.0s)]
*  We got tour manager Bizzel Gibbons is sitting here in the studio [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=1034.0s)]
*  Just to throw him in the middle of our shit [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=1037.0s)]
*  Because looking at him, he's looking over there like, yeah, I met most of them [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=1038.0s)]
*  I had one brother named Scott that's the middle older [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=1041.0s)]
*  That was a straight gangster rap guy [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=1044.0s)]
*  Like Tupac, Biggie, like gangster gang [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=1047.0s)]
*  The more gangster the better [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=1050.0s)]
*  Was he dating white chicks still or how gangster was he? [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=1052.0s)]
*  No, he was everywhere [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=1054.0s)]
*  His dick didn't discriminate [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=1055.0s)]
*  He was a man [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=1058.0s)]
*  He got that Biden [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=1059.0s)]
*  Yeah, for sure [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=1060.0s)]
*  He was all about it all [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=1061.0s)]
*  And we lived in a super mixed neighborhood anyway [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=1062.0s)]
*  So it was just super common to, you know, like all my brothers had a black best friend or something [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=1065.0s)]
*  It was just so many, you know, whatever [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=1069.0s)]
*  The neighbors were black [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=1070.0s)]
*  We had a Chinese guy in the neighborhood [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=1072.0s)]
*  A couple Mexicans [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=1074.0s)]
*  We had an Iranian family down at the bottom of the street that were super savage, dude [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=1075.0s)]
*  They'd bring Iranian food up, dude [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=1078.0s)]
*  Iraqi food [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=1080.0s)]
*  And it was fucking fire, dude [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=1081.0s)]
*  But anyways, so I'm fucking high [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=1082.0s)]
*  But we'd get in the car and like all these different radio stages would play [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=1085.0s)]
*  So like one brother would be gangster rap [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=1089.0s)]
*  My sister would listen to like nothing but Metallica or Stone Temple Pilots [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=1091.0s)]
*  Yeah, for sure [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=1095.0s)]
*  Like fucking Nirvana when they first came out [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=1096.0s)]
*  This was all huge [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=1098.0s)]
*  And then I had another brother listen to like super hip hop shit [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=1099.0s)]
*  Like Biz Markie kind of shit, Wu Tang shit [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=1102.0s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=1105.0s)]
*  Yeah, and then dad would listen to either jazz or back then like singer-songwriter stuff [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=1106.0s)]
*  Like James Taylor, Jim Croce [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=1111.0s)]
*  My mother listened to Motown, Oldies and like outlaw country music [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=1114.0s)]
*  So it's like every room I'd walk into or everywhere I'd go [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=1118.0s)]
*  It'd be some different music playing [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=1123.0s)]
*  So when people are like, dude, you kind of do all kinds of music [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=1125.0s)]
*  I'm like, I'm a fucking human jukebox, man [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=1127.0s)]
*  I grew up in a, you know [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=1129.0s)]
*  I didn't get to pick a music I liked and get to play it [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=1130.0s)]
*  Because I didn't fucking, you know [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=1133.0s)]
*  Everybody else had their genre of music and their world but me [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=1134.0s)]
*  I didn't have like a place I could go listen to what I wanted to listen to [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=1137.0s)]
*  So I just had to listen to whatever fucking room I walked in [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=1141.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's funny [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=1144.0s)]
*  The younger brother is kind of, you kind of that ear victim, bro [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=1145.0s)]
*  You know, it's like whatever [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=1148.0s)]
*  You kind of, you start to get into whatever anybody else is into [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=1149.0s)]
*  That's it, I never thought about that [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=1152.0s)]
*  The older brother really gets to pick the radio [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=1154.0s)]
*  And that kind of shapes the younger brother a little bit [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=1156.0s)]
*  It's like if my brother's listening to Dr. Dre, then I'm all dreed up [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=1159.0s)]
*  I'm buying that t-shirt with the weed leaves [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=1163.0s)]
*  And when he switches to Nirvana, dude, I'm, you know, I'm cutting my wrist [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=1165.0s)]
*  But not with sharp silverware [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=1169.0s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=1170.0s)]
*  I didn't get to get in the car and be like [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=1171.0s)]
*  I really want to listen to 107.5, the river [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=1173.0s)]
*  Nobody gave a fuck what I wanted to listen to, you know [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=1175.0s)]
*  Like we didn't even know you could talk [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=1178.0s)]
*  I'll tell you the first cassette tape I ever got given [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=1180.0s)]
*  I got all these gifts for Christmas and they were like [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=1182.0s)]
*  We got one last gift from you and this is from your brothers and sisters [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=1185.0s)]
*  I was like, oh, this is probably going to be the coolest gift ever [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=1188.0s)]
*  And they gave me a little bit of package and it was a cassette tape [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=1191.0s)]
*  And it was Rex and Effect's Rump Shaker [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=1194.0s)]
*  And I was like, this is gangster [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=1197.0s)]
*  And I remember at that moment it was something that was finally mine [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=1199.0s)]
*  Because they, some mama had bought me a boom box [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=1202.0s)]
*  And daddy had bought me a boom box [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=1205.0s)]
*  But nobody, I didn't have nothing to play in it yet [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=1207.0s)]
*  So then my brother, and they did the coolest thing besides that [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=1209.0s)]
*  And then they, when they handed me the Rex and Effect tapes [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=1211.0s)]
*  Then they handed me five blank cassette tapes [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=1213.0s)]
*  And I said, what are these for? [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=1216.0s)]
*  And they were like, we're going to show you how to record songs off the radio [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=1217.0s)]
*  You remember this era? [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=1221.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=1222.0s)]
*  You put the cassette tape in, listen, for all of y'all that want to know how old I am [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=1223.0s)]
*  I'm that fucking old [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=1227.0s)]
*  Top ten, when that top ten came on? [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=1228.0s)]
*  Yeah, you'd go to the top ten and you'd wait for the perfect moment for the song to start [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=1230.0s)]
*  Then you'd hit the play and record button [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=1232.0s)]
*  You got to get it just right [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=1234.0s)]
*  Just right, because you didn't want to hear the radio DJ or the skip [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=1235.0s)]
*  You wanted just the song, then you'd stop right there [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=1238.0s)]
*  And you'd play it for one more second so there was a space between the two songs [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=1240.0s)]
*  And then you'd hit it again [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=1243.0s)]
*  You know, or you'd call and request a song that wasn't popular yet [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=1245.0s)]
*  And you'd have to wait for hours for them to play it [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=1248.0s)]
*  They're like, who's this donkey? [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=1250.0s)]
*  And they taught me that, so I started making mixed cassette tapes [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=1251.0s)]
*  And I knew I was on to something different then because I'd get in the car and find out [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=1255.0s)]
*  I got a cassette tape, they'd be like, we don't care about your cassette tape, please play it [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=1259.0s)]
*  And it would go from rap to something else [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=1262.0s)]
*  And a brother would be like, what the fuck is up? [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=1265.0s)]
*  I'd be like, well, Shelby taught me about this song [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=1266.0s)]
*  So everybody got happy [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=1268.0s)]
*  So you really were, you really were like a jukebox [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=1270.0s)]

*  So what was the family life like? What was it like growing up? [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=1420.0s)]
*  Were you guys like, so you had a mom and y'all had a stepdad or no stepdad? [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=1424.0s)]
*  No, no, I had a father [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=1428.0s)]
*  Oh you had a dad? [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=1429.0s)]
*  Best friend in the world, sweetest dude on earth [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=1430.0s)]
*  He taught me pretty much everything about life [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=1432.0s)]
*  Buddy was your dad right? [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=1434.0s)]
*  Yeah I've heard stories about him [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=1435.0s)]
*  He is a fucking legend, he really is dude [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=1436.0s)]
*  Old school gangster just laid back, storyteller but softly spoken [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=1439.0s)]
*  Didn't talk nearly as much as me but said a lot more [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=1444.0s)]
*  And he was an old school gangster like that [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=1447.0s)]
*  But dad and mother were together whenever I was younger [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=1449.0s)]
*  They divorced in my earlier teenage years [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=1452.0s)]
*  Why'd they divorce you think? [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=1455.0s)]
*  Oh fuck dude, frankly mom, god I love her to death, sorry if you're watching this, Buddy [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=1457.0s)]
*  But she dealt with so much of her own shit man [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=1462.0s)]
*  I couldn't, I don't, who she is now and who she was then are two different people [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=1466.0s)]
*  So I'm sure she won't be offended by this, I couldn't have been with her [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=1470.0s)]
*  You know what I mean? Who she was back then [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=1473.0s)]
*  He was pushing the square through a circle for a long time [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=1475.0s)]
*  She was really struggling, I'm talking about a woman that I didn't see not wearing a nightgown for 15 years [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=1478.0s)]
*  You know what I mean? I don't have a memory of her being in a kindergarten thing [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=1484.0s)]
*  None of that shit [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=1489.0s)]
*  Damn, so that must have left you feeling almost like [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=1491.0s)]
*  If your mom wasn't showing up for a lot of stuff [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=1493.0s)]
*  It probably left you feeling kind of unseen or something sometimes [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=1495.0s)]
*  For sure [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=1500.0s)]
*  And no judgment against your mom [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=1501.0s)]
*  My mom struggles with a lot of that and it's just, they went through it [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=1502.0s)]
*  So somebody did it, they went through it [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=1506.0s)]
*  Yeah in their era, now that I'm old enough I look back at her and go [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=1508.0s)]
*  Man she grew up in a house with three other sisters [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=1511.0s)]
*  She grew up with a single mother, my mother is 73 years old [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=1513.0s)]
*  So if you think about her growing up with a single mother raising four kids [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=1517.0s)]
*  She was the town whore in everybody's eyes [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=1521.0s)]
*  That's normal now, you see a bitch at the grocery store right now with five kids [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=1523.0s)]
*  And be like shit she must be from Antioch [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=1526.0s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? You seen it back then [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=1528.0s)]
*  It was like you fucking whore, you damn harlot [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=1531.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's like totally different world [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=1534.0s)]
*  So I kind of get where she came from [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=1538.0s)]
*  Her mother, which was my granny, was just fucking mean as a fucking beaver on meth [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=1540.0s)]
*  She was just a fucking, you know what I'm saying? She was mean dude [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=1545.0s)]
*  And I knew that about her [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=1548.0s)]
*  I get her issues, but yeah they had divorced [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=1550.0s)]
*  But Pops ran a meat company for years [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=1554.0s)]
*  Oh damn what kind of meat was it? [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=1556.0s)]
*  Oh dude we got three generations of meat salesmen [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=1558.0s)]
*  Dude I can tell you more about a pig than I can tell you about pussy [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=1560.0s)]
*  And I know a little bit about both [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=1563.0s)]
*  And I'm telling you man, my grandfather ran a meat truck called D-Ford Sausage Company [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=1565.0s)]
*  And then my father took it over and it was called D-Ford Ho-Sale Meats [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=1572.0s)]
*  So they changed LLCs huh? [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=1576.0s)]
*  Yeah, well you know dad got into the wholesale business [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=1578.0s)]
*  My grandfather was old enough that they actually rode around in a truck [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=1581.0s)]
*  And went door to door [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=1585.0s)]
*  This is back when the closest grocery store to a neighborhood was 15-20 minutes away [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=1587.0s)]
*  And it was a Byrider, or C.B. Smith, or Piggly Wiggly [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=1591.0s)]
*  This is long before Walmart so you probably grew up in an area where the meat trucks came to the neighborhood [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=1594.0s)]
*  Well I remember they had a dude who was Schwan's truck or something [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=1600.0s)]
*  And this dude would roll through and this dude honestly was banging some ladies [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=1604.0s)]
*  I don't know how this guy was a real Casanova [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=1608.0s)]
*  The second he saw the kids he would be all pissed and stuff you could tell [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=1613.0s)]
*  But they had everything in there like frozen things like cookies and beef [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=1617.0s)]
*  He had the beef area, he had to get in the beef area [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=1622.0s)]
*  The beef area, I remember when you opened that bitch up it was like [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=1626.0s)]
*  It was so cold in there as a child you couldn't even look in there for long [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=1630.0s)]
*  You were afraid to even look at the beef [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=1633.0s)]
*  And then they came through with the little Chinese food portal at one point [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=1635.0s)]
*  And that's when I think the people I was living with at the time they cut it off [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=1639.0s)]
*  They said we're not doing all of that shit [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=1642.0s)]
*  Well at that point it wasn't far away from being food trucks in that era [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=1644.0s)]
*  It was like an early food truck but you had to cook it [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=1647.0s)]
*  Yeah for sure, no but yeah Big Buford, my grandfather would just pull up with a [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=1650.0s)]
*  And he did nothing but pork, it was just sausage [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=1654.0s)]
*  It was a D. Ford sausage company, it was a family recipe [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=1657.0s)]
*  We still have it to this day [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=1660.0s)]
*  And my father was entrepreneurial so he was like I want to sell more than pork [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=1662.0s)]
*  So he got into poultry and beef as well [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=1666.0s)]
*  And he was like instead of taking it door to door, change with the times [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=1668.0s)]
*  I'm not just going to service door to door in the small piggly wigglies and buy rights [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=1672.0s)]
*  I'm going to start going to local barbecue pits and local restaurants that were local owned and local ran [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=1676.0s)]
*  He sold meat that way and housed his own meat [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=1681.0s)]
*  My brother now, my oldest brother, the one that was more of a hip hop head [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=1685.0s)]
*  He is still in the meat business [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=1690.0s)]
*  He's still in the meat business to this day [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=1693.0s)]
*  Oh dude it's still, it tickles me pink because it's like my dad's still here [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=1696.0s)]
*  I go hang out with my brother and all his meat salesman friends [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=1700.0s)]
*  It's funny how that business is generational that way [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=1703.0s)]
*  Because most of them guys you'll meet, daddy was in the meat business [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=1706.0s)]
*  A lot of businesses are, a lot of the police officers, boat captains [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=1709.0s)]
*  A lot of things are, it just comes down through the family line [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=1713.0s)]
*  I was the only one that had a vision outside of anything like that [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=1716.0s)]
*  My other brother ended up doing a survey, he's a land surveyor [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=1720.0s)]
*  And does all that kind of stuff [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=1725.0s)]
*  He's like engineering and stuff, civil engineering [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=1728.0s)]
*  Yeah I actually got my degree in urban planning bro [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=1731.0s)]
*  In urban planning? [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=1737.0s)]
*  Yeah, I'm an urban planner I guess [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=1738.0s)]
*  I don't know if my license is active or whatever [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=1742.0s)]
*  I don't know if I ever got a license but I am [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=1746.0s)]
*  I guess I'm legally an urban planner I guess [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=1749.0s)]
*  I mean I got the, you know, I did it [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=1751.0s)]
*  I think it's mostly about, I mean I know what it's about [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=1754.0s)]
*  It's about neighborhoods, like if you have to have like [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=1757.0s)]
*  Say you're putting together a neighborhood and somebody needs [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=1760.0s)]
*  You need to know where the post box, post office box is going [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=1763.0s)]
*  Like if a mail truck is coming through, how to get it through [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=1766.0s)]
*  Give it the best directions [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=1769.0s)]
*  Yeah he deals with like, can you build here, is this a flood land or [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=1772.0s)]
*  You know, shit like that [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=1777.0s)]
*  But yeah I'm the only one that even took to like [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=1779.0s)]
*  Something artist driven or creative minded at all [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=1781.0s)]
*  So when did it start to like really take shape or something [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=1783.0s)]
*  Or what do you think kind of, did you have some pitfalls or something [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=1786.0s)]
*  Like what was it like in your teen years growing up [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=1789.0s)]
*  Because I know you got into some trouble right [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=1791.0s)]
*  Yeah yeah I got into a little trouble so [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=1793.0s)]
*  The other side of my father that was the side that I seen the most [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=1795.0s)]
*  More than the hard working salesman was, he was a hustler [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=1800.0s)]
*  He was a hustler [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=1803.0s)]
*  So my father booked bets on the side most of his life [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=1804.0s)]
*  You know it's part of a story that he didn't tell [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=1807.0s)]
*  Because later in life he went on to marry a fucking Methodist minister [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=1809.0s)]
*  And totally different dudes than the dude I grew up with you know [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=1812.0s)]
*  Which I love both versions of him [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=1815.0s)]
*  But I grew up with the old gangster that booked bets [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=1817.0s)]
*  You know I grew up on a bar still with him booking bets [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=1819.0s)]
*  And what bets on anything, football games all kinds of stuff [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=1822.0s)]
*  Well he ran like the old school football cards [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=1825.0s)]
*  So he wasn't just like a gambler, he was the dude who booked them [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=1827.0s)]
*  So he'd drop off football cards to like Stanley Street Bar [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=1829.0s)]
*  And Larry's and Antioch and TGI Friday's and Antioch when it first opened up [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=1833.0s)]
*  And like all these local bars he would run football cards to them [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=1837.0s)]
*  He'd take phone bets to parlays and you know flex [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=1841.0s)]
*  I remember the card, I remember my buddy's dad worked over at like a Ford dealership right [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=1845.0s)]
*  And he'd come home, some of them he'd give us a card [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=1849.0s)]
*  You know we could you know we'd put five, six dollars on it or something [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=1851.0s)]
*  That's when five or six dollars was a lot [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=1855.0s)]
*  It was a big deal you know especially for you just to be guessing if it was going to work [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=1857.0s)]
*  And you know he made a deal with all of us brothers when we were younger [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=1860.0s)]
*  That you know he said I'll give you a choice [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=1863.0s)]
*  I'll either pay you per football card that you put out [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=1865.0s)]
*  Or I won't pay you per football card and I'll let you share in the revenue of it [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=1868.0s)]
*  So his thing was like either you can take this risk and make more money with me [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=1874.0s)]
*  Or I'll just give you a flat fee for every you know [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=1878.0s)]
*  X amount of dollars per football card you put in the streets [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=1881.0s)]
*  So he kind of taught us that work ethic and it was fun to watch the brothers [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=1885.0s)]
*  Because you have some that played it safe [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=1888.0s)]
*  You know and then you had the me's and that's when he knew something was going to be different [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=1890.0s)]
*  You got risky [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=1893.0s)]
*  Me and another brother, we had some cousins that played it safe [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=1894.0s)]
*  Me and all the brothers went for the risky [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=1896.0s)]
*  Me and all brothers were like nah fuck that we're going for it [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=1898.0s)]
*  You know what I'm saying like we're putting it all in the line [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=1901.0s)]
*  We're trying to upsell people on bets you know [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=1903.0s)]
*  And trying to figure it out so I always had that hustler in me [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=1905.0s)]
*  And then when mom and dad divorced I stayed with mama [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=1909.0s)]
*  You know what I'm saying because I felt like she was the one that needed me [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=1912.0s)]
*  But you know in hindsight as a kid I should have never [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=1915.0s)]
*  I should have went with what I needed not what I thought somebody else needed [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=1918.0s)]
*  But that just shows your nature as a human probably [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=1924.0s)]
*  Yeah for sure I love my mama I thought my mama needed me [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=1927.0s)]
*  So I was like okay now I got to be the [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=1929.0s)]
*  And I didn't learn enough about football [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=1931.0s)]
*  I was fucking 14, 15, 16 years old I can't go book bets [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=1933.0s)]
*  Yeah fuck the Jets that's what most people know [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=1937.0s)]
*  Yeah it's like I'll just fucking you know I'll go you know [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=1939.0s)]
*  I'll just go find alternate means of money [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=1942.0s)]
*  And for that it was you know drugs and drugs normally lead to robbing [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=1945.0s)]
*  And you know just goofy shit as a kid I just got in a lot of trouble [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=1948.0s)]
*  I ended up in juvenile for a lot of years [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=1952.0s)]
*  And the juvenile years rolled over [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=1954.0s)]
*  Because I went to juvenile I think the first time when I was like 13 or 14 [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=1956.0s)]
*  And just kind of went to that revolving door [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=1960.0s)]
*  Ended up in juvenile penitentiary ended up in group homes [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=1962.0s)]
*  Kept running from them [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=1965.0s)]
*  What was that penitentiary like? [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=1966.0s)]
*  Was it pretty anything you miss about it? [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=1968.0s)]
*  Dude no, fuck no man I tell people all the time [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=1970.0s)]
*  Jail, prison, all that stuff dude is [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=1974.0s)]
*  When people are like I love when dudes are like [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=1978.0s)]

*  It's like I came back and the whole unit threw me a birthday party [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=2008.0s)]
*  I was working in the kitchen and I came in [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=2011.0s)]
*  And everybody had like put all their snacks together [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=2013.0s)]
*  And they'd set up a big jelly roll birthday party [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=2015.0s)]
*  Because I was going home soon [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=2018.0s)]
*  So it was like a going away birthday party [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=2019.0s)]

*  It'd be realistic right [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=2072.0s)]
*  That'd be some stuff because you know you get a canteen in there and stuff [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=2074.0s)]
*  Oh because y'all had to make bootleg cakes huh [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=2077.0s)]

*  Now so you'd be in there like what was your space in the penitentiary environment [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=2084.0s)]
*  What kind of guy were you were you just kind of the guy making everybody laugh [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=2088.0s)]
*  Were you kind of a hard head or what kind of [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=2092.0s)]
*  Nah dude I was just dude I guess I probably made people laugh and entertain [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=2094.0s)]
*  We did freestyle Fridays and I worked in the kitchen and you know [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=2098.0s)]
*  Yeah I was just there dude [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=2102.0s)]
*  My young juvenile years I was more of a hard head [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=2104.0s)]
*  Cause I was the only white guy there and I felt like I had a point to prove [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=2106.0s)]
*  So I was you know whatever [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=2110.0s)]
*  And did they ever let you say the N word or not [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=2112.0s)]
*  You know what's crazy is that is a word in which context right [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=2114.0s)]
*  Cause there's one way in which you're never allowed to say it [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=2119.0s)]
*  No matter what [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=2121.0s)]
*  And then the other way you know there's certain white guys that yeah for sure [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=2123.0s)]
*  In different penitentiaries and prisons and jails and stuff [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=2126.0s)]
*  Every now and then somebody yeah there's a cool black guy that lets you get away with it [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=2128.0s)]
*  Yeah for sure they'll let you get away with it [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=2131.0s)]
*  You know you want to make sure you don't have a neighbor recording you or nothing [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=2133.0s)]
*  That stuff will stick with you [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=2135.0s)]
*  Shout out to our boy but no I'm just joking I love you Bubba [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=2137.0s)]
*  But you know it's like you want to make sure that [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=2141.0s)]
*  Yeah no they don't you know it's different man [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=2143.0s)]
*  And it's also different per jail [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=2145.0s)]
*  Every jail and every prison and everything has a different structure [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=2147.0s)]
*  You know it gets way more racist in federal prison than in state prison [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=2150.0s)]
*  And especially like county jails is a totally different world cause you know everybody [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=2154.0s)]
*  When you go to the county jail there's like a degree of separation between you and everybody in the county jail [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=2158.0s)]
*  Oh wow yeah cause it's all local [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=2162.0s)]
*  It's all local like worst case scenario you're from North Nashville [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=2164.0s)]
*  We're two minutes away from me dropping somebody's name in North Nashville that we both know [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=2167.0s)]
*  You know what I mean the other problem with that is it's a lot of real drama in there though [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=2172.0s)]
*  Like where guys have been like I have been waiting to run into you [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=2176.0s)]
*  Cause you had a problem with my cousin you know whatever years [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=2180.0s)]
*  Oh yeah that's really that's really the uh that's the real confluence of the local bullshit [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=2183.0s)]
*  Yeah where it's like in the federal scale there's no way me and a dude in Wisconsin ever have a personal problem with each other [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=2189.0s)]
*  Right right right [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=2194.0s)]
*  Where you know in the county jail I had a lot of personal problems with people [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=2195.0s)]
*  And what about a lot of gays in there any type of activity like that a lot of gay activity or was that [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=2198.0s)]
*  When you get to like prison prison you start having dudes that are you know busting their butt open [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=2203.0s)]
*  Yeah [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=2207.0s)]
*  But the county jail that's not happening I spent more time in the county jail than the big prisons so [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=2208.0s)]
*  Cause I was more of a revolving door kind of criminal go for a year or two come home [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=2213.0s)]
*  Go for a year or two come home you know I was just like a I was that guy [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=2217.0s)]
*  I was like oh he's back you know what I'm saying [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=2221.0s)]
*  Like somebody that winners in Florida like that kind of [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=2223.0s)]

*  Oh the door, a little more privacy [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=3396.0s)]
*  There's a little peep window there you know what I mean? [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=3398.0s)]
*  A little pie flap to hand you food through if you're locked down or something [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=3401.0s)]
*  And did y'all have any sports groups in there? [[00:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=3405.0s)]
*  Yeah I boxed whenever I was young and it's my love for fighting [[00:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=3407.0s)]
*  And still like as a fight fan and a boxing fan we had a program at one of the facilities [[00:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=3411.0s)]
*  And they had basketball courts at most of them [[00:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=3416.0s)]
*  But you know what I'm really good at because of Juvenile? [[00:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=3418.0s)]

*  I fucking fuck Forrest up [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=3428.0s)]
*  I haven't played in years anytime we get drunk and find a ping pong table [[00:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=3430.0s)]
*  I just goddamn go in there [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=3434.0s)]

*  I can fucking play ping pong dude [[00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=3441.0s)]
*  Because I wasn't good enough to get on the basketball court with all the black guys [[00:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=3443.0s)]
*  So I just held court at the ping pong table in Juvenile [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=3446.0s)]
*  I like that [[00:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=3450.0s)]
*  That was my thing [[00:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=3451.0s)]
*  But the last time I was in jail jail [[00:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=3453.0s)]
*  Yeah [[00:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=3456.0s)]
*  And I knew that Bailey was born while I was incarcerated [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=3457.0s)]
*  That's my daughter, that's my oldest [[00:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=3463.0s)]

*  Yeah I mean it fucked with me [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=3466.0s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=3467.0s)]
*  It was like it was the most first moment where I realized I couldn't be selfish [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=3468.0s)]
*  So I was like selfish as far as like I had a reason to live outside of self [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=3472.0s)]
*  Because I tell people all the time without purpose [[00:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=3477.0s)]
*  Jason D. Ford will drive him [[00:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=3480.0s)]
*  He's a train that's destined to wreck [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=3483.0s)]
*  Yeah [[00:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=3486.0s)]
*  Right? [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=3487.0s)]
*  It's purpose that drives me every day [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=3488.0s)]
*  It's providing for my daughter [[00:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=3490.0s)]
*  It's making music that helps people [[00:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=3491.0s)]
*  It's helping friends [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=3493.0s)]
*  It's building stuff bigger than myself [[00:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=3495.0s)]
*  Because I put so little value into myself obviously right? [[00:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=3497.0s)]
*  So at that moment I was like I gotta do something [[00:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=3501.0s)]
*  I don't want to be an absent father [[00:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=3505.0s)]
*  I had a very present father [[00:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=3507.0s)]
*  I didn't want to be an absent father [[00:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=3509.0s)]
*  And I was like I need to stand up and do something here [[00:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=3511.0s)]
*  My skill sets are still to this day utterly fucking limited [[00:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=3514.0s)]
*  Minimal? [[00:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=3519.0s)]
*  Yeah dude I'm not good at much [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=3520.0s)]
*  Really? [[00:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=3521.0s)]
*  I mean ping pong and songs and talking shit a little bit [[00:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=3522.0s)]
*  And that fucking... [[00:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=3525.0s)]
*  Yeah [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=3526.0s)]
*  And there it stops [[00:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=3527.0s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=3528.0s)]
*  It's like... [[00:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=3529.0s)]
*  Yeah that is a short list [[00:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=3530.0s)]
*  I'm not going to win a talent show or anything like that [[00:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=3531.0s)]
*  If I had to do something other than what I do now [[00:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=3533.0s)]
*  Right [[00:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=3535.0s)]
*  And I was like man music's gotta be it [[00:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=3536.0s)]
*  So I came home and started putting out mixtapes [[00:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=3539.0s)]
*  I'll tell you where I got fucking... [[00:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=3542.0s)]

*  Pull up Jelly Roll 10 minute freestyle [[00:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=3547.0s)]
*  My buddy Chad Arms recorded this [[00:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=3549.0s)]
*  And he had like a Sony flip cam or something when I first got out [[00:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=3551.0s)]

*  We put this up in 16 but I actually had it up before from like 2008 [[00:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=3572.0s)]
*  That's you? [[00:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=3580.0s)]
*  Eight or nine yeah that's me fresh out [[00:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=3581.0s)]
*  I mean when I say fresh out of jail like I had just got that haircut [[00:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=3582.0s)]
*  My homeboy had just bought me that shirt [[00:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=3585.0s)]
*  I can tell that this is very near a halfway house [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=3588.0s)]
*  Because that guy in the hustler shirt is always with... [[00:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=3590.0s)]
*  He's always in the background of every halfway house video [[00:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=3594.0s)]
*  Yes for sure dude [[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=3596.0s)]
*  That guy Frank or whatever his name is [[00:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=3597.0s)]
*  I mean I know he's not... [[00:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=3598.0s)]
*  He probably is Frank [[00:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=3599.0s)]
*  For sure [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=3600.0s)]
*  It's my Uncle T-Shaw [[01:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=3601.0s)]
*  Is it really? [[01:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=3602.0s)]
*  He's like a Frank if I get the theme [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=3603.0s)]
*  But dude that dude is in the background [[01:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=3604.0s)]
*  This is like that kind of a thing for sure [[01:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=3605.0s)]
*  I'm fresh out [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=3608.0s)]
*  The lady I was with at the time bought me a phone [[01:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=3609.0s)]
*  This is how old this was I referenced the phone [[01:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=3612.0s)]
*  Because in the Frippin' Freestyle I say [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=3614.0s)]
*  Your baby mama loved me [[01:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=3616.0s)]
*  Been out of jail for a week and got a touch screen [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=3618.0s)]
*  It was like a big deal to have a touch screen phone back then for me at least [[01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=3620.0s)]
*  The first time it came out was in 2008 [[01:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=3624.0s)]
*  Let's see that shit run it up [[01:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=3627.0s)]
*  It's got a base tip but sometimes it's real white [[01:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=3637.0s)]
*  And you don't know what a hundred stacks feels like [[01:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=3640.0s)]
*  It's Casville I said it's Casville [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=3643.0s)]
*  I ain't got a grandma to tell you I crush up in Nashville [[01:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=3645.0s)]
*  I'm bringing you all my money man I'm on the paper check [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=3648.0s)]
*  So this is it right? [[01:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=3651.0s)]
*  If you ever got 10 minutes to blow it's worth watching [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=3653.0s)]
*  I was just like fresh out of jail with a lot to say [[01:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=3655.0s)]
*  And we uploaded it in 2008 when I... [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=3658.0s)]
*  2000 no I thought 2009 when I first got home [[01:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=3661.0s)]
*  And where does all that come from? [[01:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=3665.0s)]
*  So how do you get to this place though? [[01:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=3667.0s)]
*  I see that you know like your mother had issues [[01:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=3669.0s)]
*  She probably maybe had some type of alcoholism or something [[01:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=3672.0s)]
*  You know you said that she had some issues right? [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=3674.0s)]

*  And I had to take it down so we put it up many years later [[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=3824.0s)]
*  But it went what they called viral back then [[01:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=3827.0s)]
*  Early early YouTube dude [[01:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=3829.0s)]
*  When you could only get to YouTube from a hard computer [[01:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=3831.0s)]
*  You didn't have a laptop [[01:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=3834.0s)]
*  You had to go to desktop type in www.youtube.com [[01:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=3836.0s)]
*  You had to write it all the way out [[01:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=3839.0s)]
*  Yeah all the way [[01:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=3840.0s)]
*  You had to hit the W's on there you know it was a thing [[01:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=3841.0s)]
*  So now you're at the spot though where you have the number 5 song [[01:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=3843.0s)]
*  Yes sir [[01:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=3848.0s)]

*  Like what kind of happened [[01:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=3856.0s)]
*  Take me through some more of it [[01:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=3857.0s)]
*  I fell in love with songwriting through the process of writing raps [[01:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=3860.0s)]
*  I immediately I was boxed into being a freestyle rapper [[01:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=3864.0s)]
*  Okay [[01:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=3868.0s)]
*  And I was like I don't want to be known for that [[01:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=3869.0s)]
*  So I started writing like songs [[01:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=3870.0s)]
*  And all of my choruses were really soulful and I'd rap the verses [[01:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=3872.0s)]
*  I had a song called [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=3875.0s)]
*  You pull up Ratt Jelly Roll, Rattin' All Alone [[01:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=3877.0s)]
*  And I had this record called Rattin' All Alone [[01:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=3879.0s)]
*  And it was really slow [[01:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=3881.0s)]
*  And me and Lil White [[01:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=3883.0s)]
*  First of all Lil White from 36 Mafia [[01:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=3884.0s)]
*  You probably remember Oxxie Ties, Jens Barr, Perkz Sesson, Lora Tabs [[01:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=3886.0s)]
*  Still one of my best friends to this day [[01:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=3888.0s)]
*  When I first came home from jail [[01:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=3890.0s)]

*  And Juicy J and DJ Paul ended up [[01:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=3897.0s)]
*  36 Mafia producing an album [[01:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=3899.0s)]
*  With me, White and a guy named Pee Peezy [[01:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=3901.0s)]
*  But outside of the first song I put out with him [[01:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=3903.0s)]
*  I started putting out these super like soulful joints like this [[01:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=3906.0s)]
*  Maybe go to like the minute mark or something [[01:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=3909.0s)]
*  I just want you to hear the chorus so you can kind of get a feel for where I'm coming from here [[01:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=3912.0s)]
*  And see this was released in 2010 [[01:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=3919.0s)]
*  Right so this was you know fucking 12 years ago right [[01:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=3922.0s)]
*  Right here, watch this, check this out at the end [[01:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=3933.0s)]
*  I just be riding all alone [[01:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=3948.0s)]
*  I just be riding all alone [[01:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=3950.0s)]
*  I just be riding all alone [[01:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=3952.0s)]
*  You can stop right there Hanson [[01:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=3954.0s)]
*  But it's like this you know 12-13 years ago right [[01:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=3956.0s)]
*  Because if it went to YouTube then [[01:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=3959.0s)]
*  Yeah that would be good now [[01:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=3961.0s)]
*  I mean that's good now [[01:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=3963.0s)]
*  So then [[01:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=3965.0s)]
*  I didn't realize I was singing that chorus [[01:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=3966.0s)]
*  Right you know what I mean [[01:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=3968.0s)]
*  Like I didn't register to me that I was singing [[01:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=3970.0s)]
*  Because I wouldn't like open up and sing it [[01:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=3972.0s)]
*  You know what I mean [[01:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=3974.0s)]
*  So I kind of like did this like talk sing thing [[01:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=3975.0s)]
*  I wasn't confident in my voice [[01:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=3977.0s)]
*  So I kind of always knew [[01:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=3978.0s)]
*  And this is something else I'm glad I got to show this to a platform as big as yours [[01:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=3980.0s)]
*  Because the therapeutic music that I make now [[01:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=3983.0s)]
*  That's so personal has always been my approach to music [[01:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=3987.0s)]
*  Like when you listen to that I'm talking about [[01:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=3991.0s)]
*  Doctors said if I don't quit living like this [[01:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=3993.0s)]
*  I won't live to see 35 I just keep on smoking like fucking I'm prepared to die [[01:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=3996.0s)]
*  I've always wrote from that kind of dark perspective you know [[01:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=4000.0s)]
*  Yeah because I'll listen to save me sometimes when I need to feel how sometimes I'm too busy [[01:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=4005.0s)]
*  I notice or too caught up to really just get my own feelings out [[01:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=4010.0s)]
*  Right [[01:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=4015.0s)]
*  And so I'll listen to save me just to [[01:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=4016.0s)]
*  So somebody else can do it for me almost in a weird way [[01:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=4018.0s)]
*  You know a lot of times I can get them but sometimes you can't [[01:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=4022.0s)]
*  No that's the beautiful thing of music man [[01:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=4025.0s)]
*  Yeah [[01:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=4027.0s)]
*  Music is the soundtrack of the soul [[01:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=4028.0s)]
*  And that's how I've always looked at it [[01:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=4031.0s)]
*  Just like tears are the expression of words we can't articulate [[01:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=4034.0s)]
*  And I look at music as being the soundtrack to the soul [[01:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=4038.0s)]
*  So I've always wanted to make music that would help people [[01:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=4041.0s)]
*  That song is a great example that song is fucking 13 14 years old [[01:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=4044.0s)]
*  So I always so the transition has been very slow [[01:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=4048.0s)]
*  It seems like it happened quick for the unseen eye because guys now are like [[01:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=4052.0s)]
*  Dude it's crazy you're on rock radio which is fucking crazy to me too [[01:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=4057.0s)]
*  But the idea that like you know we've always leaned that way [[01:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=4060.0s)]
*  I just didn't know I could sing five six years ago I started like really singing [[01:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=4064.0s)]
*  I got drunk and went and sang but you got a you got a do you got a go-to karaoke song [[01:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=4067.0s)]
*  Yeah I do actually I do rocking around the Christmas tree [[01:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=4071.0s)]
*  Right [[01:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=4075.0s)]
*  I do a Christmas Carol because I'm not that great of a singer and everybody likes it [[01:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=4076.0s)]
*  Everybody first like fuck this guy you know you're you know but then like 10 seconds into it [[01:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=4080.0s)]
*  They're like you will get a you know or they're like rockin or you know [[01:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=4086.0s)]
*  So it's like nobody can really super hate on a Christmas Carol so I'll play the safe bet [[01:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=4091.0s)]
*  Right no dude it's awesome but what I love about that is I tell people we all secretly have a go-to [[01:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=4096.0s)]
*  Song we sing in those moments you know karaoke thing [[01:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=4101.0s)]
*  Oh I wish mine was that Smashing Pumpkins song bro [[01:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=4105.0s)]

*  Just take those old records off [[01:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=4120.0s)]
*  That's it that's it that's it for sure yeah [[01:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=4123.0s)]
*  100% it's crazy right it's like the song it's stuck in every white trash humans mind forever [[01:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=4126.0s)]
*  But it's uh and you forget it's there and then it pocks its little fucking head out [[01:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=4132.0s)]

*  I know that shit bro [[01:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=4141.0s)]
*  I'm gonna slide around in my socks [[01:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=4143.0s)]
*  My mom used to put on Brian Adams she got one of those cassette tape deals where you give them 30 cents [[01:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=4145.0s)]
*  And they send you six cassettes or whatever and then you don't pay them and they sue you right [[01:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=4150.0s)]
*  So we had that deal and one of them was Brian Adams [[01:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=4155.0s)]
*  Look into my heart [[01:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=4159.0s)]
*  Oh yeah [[01:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=4161.0s)]
*  And you will see what you mean to me [[01:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=4162.0s)]
*  There we go sing it to us Steve [[01:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=4167.0s)]
*  I can't [[01:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=4169.0s)]
*  But mine was old time rock and roll [[01:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=4170.0s)]
*  And I go out with some business guys one night that I'm working on a production deal with [[01:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=4173.0s)]
*  It sounds like drugs [[01:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=4177.0s)]
*  Yeah it's fucking torturous and we're all doing karaoke drunk [[01:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=4179.0s)]
*  And I did Bob Seeger and somebody in the group was like dude you can really fucking sing [[01:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=4184.0s)]
*  And I don't know why it's all it took for me to be like maybe I can [[01:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=4190.0s)]
*  And I just started singing I started like really singing like from my ball sack then [[01:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=4194.0s)]
*  You know at first I was just singing from my chest and I started singing from my ass [[01:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=4199.0s)]
*  That's when I was like just clenched my butt cheeks together and fucking opened my little fucking hips [[01:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=4203.0s)]
*  And just fucking go for it [[01:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=4208.0s)]
*  Like a hound dog [[01:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=4211.0s)]
*  The problem is I'm now having to learn how to sing and work backwards from there [[01:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=4213.0s)]
*  So it's like trying to do the stable stuff you know what I mean [[01:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=4217.0s)]
*  Or the inflections of lower stuff is like it's so fucking hard [[01:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=4220.0s)]
*  Where it's like just take those old records off the shelf [[01:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=4225.0s)]
*  It's so much fucking easier right than like I use man's aid [[01:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=4229.0s)]
*  Yeah that sounds hard [[01:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=4237.0s)]
*  I want to say this though dude what about the ladies [[01:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=4239.0s)]

*  You were just at the will of the world [[01:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=4493.0s)]
*  Oh dude $50 a night is what I got paid for like three years straight [[01:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=4495.0s)]
*  Like $50 a night [[01:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=4500.0s)]
*  We didn't have enough room to get gas and a hotel [[01:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=4502.0s)]
*  Yeah [[01:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=4504.0s)]
*  So it was like we just had to go fucking park at truck stops and sleep some nights [[01:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=4506.0s)]
*  You know we were banging on merch [[01:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=4508.0s)]
*  We were counting on hand to hand CDs and T-shirts [[01:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=4510.0s)]
*  Dude how'd you used to do them? [[01:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=4514.0s)]
*  I'll tell you this I used to bring [[01:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=4516.0s)]
*  So I remember at one point I bought that burner baby [[01:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=4518.0s)]
*  That three shelf burner bro [[01:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=4520.0s)]
*  For the CDs [[01:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=4522.0s)]
*  I think I was in damn up near Canada and somebody [[01:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=4524.0s)]
*  Run that bitch across the border [[01:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=4526.0s)]
*  Still had sweat on the outside of it [[01:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=4528.0s)]
*  Really you talking about the CD burner the tower right [[01:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=4530.0s)]
*  I bought the tower [[01:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=4532.0s)]
*  It took about 19 minutes [[01:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=4534.0s)]
*  And then we'd put them on a spindle [[01:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=4536.0s)]
*  I'd hand write on every fucking one of them [[01:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=4538.0s)]
*  And I would sell them right off the spindle [[01:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=4540.0s)]
*  And I'd make a title of a different title [[01:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=4542.0s)]
*  Like they were different albums or whatever [[01:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=4544.0s)]
*  No for sure we did that for fun or we'd autograph them [[01:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=4546.0s)]
*  And we'd sell them off the spindle [[01:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=4548.0s)]
*  We wouldn't even give you a case for them [[01:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=4550.0s)]
*  It'd just be like right off the spindle [[01:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=4552.0s)]
*  This is yours for three dollars or five dollars [[01:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=4554.0s)]
*  Or whatever I could do [[01:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=4556.0s)]
*  I used to do it for donations [[01:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=4558.0s)]
*  In hopes that somebody would give me some more money [[01:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=4560.0s)]
*  I'd be like look man I'm just fucking [[01:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=4562.0s)]
*  I got 40 bucks to open this show [[01:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=4564.0s)]
*  I remember a lady one time in Fort Worth Texas [[01:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=4566.0s)]
*  Came up and gave me a hundred dollars [[01:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=4568.0s)]
*  She's like my husband just died [[01:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=4570.0s)]
*  She gave me a hundred dollars [[01:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=4572.0s)]
*  For one of the CDs off the spindle [[01:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=4574.0s)]
*  Wow she was like I don't really care [[01:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=4576.0s)]
*  I'm not into your art I'm just into your hustle [[01:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=4578.0s)]
*  I think about how many people bought the CD [[01:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=4580.0s)]
*  And never listened to it [[01:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=4582.0s)]
*  Like the guys in Manhattan [[01:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=4584.0s)]
*  I want to say thank you to everybody that bought [[01:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=4586.0s)]
*  Sometimes I think it was a DVD [[01:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=4588.0s)]
*  I don't even know what was on that [[01:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=4590.0s)]
*  But I sold them [[01:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=4592.0s)]
*  And thank you man [[01:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=4594.0s)]
*  We did it and I was at that phase in my life [[01:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=4596.0s)]
*  When I met Bunny and she was like [[01:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=4598.0s)]
*  She adopted a little pound puppy [[01:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=4600.0s)]
*  And where'd you meet her at? Where were you guys at? [[01:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=4602.0s)]
*  We were at this bar called the Las Vegas Country Saloon [[01:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=4604.0s)]
*  On Fremont Street [[01:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=4608.0s)]
*  A lot of titles in one [[01:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=4610.0s)]
*  Yeah it's pretty big, Las Vegas Country Saloon [[01:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=4612.0s)]
*  And Fremont Street [[01:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=4614.0s)]
*  And Bunny was doing high end escort stuff [[01:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=4616.0s)]
*  She was a sex worker in Vegas [[01:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=4618.0s)]
*  And she was getting a lot of money [[01:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=4620.0s)]
*  I mean she had like a real big plush penthouse [[01:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=4622.0s)]
*  And a couple cars [[01:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=4624.0s)]
*  We had a sex worker on the podcast one time [[01:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=4626.0s)]
*  Oh dope you should get Bunny on here one time [[01:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=4628.0s)]
*  She'd love to tell her story [[01:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=4630.0s)]
*  I'm on a dumb blonde podcast, lead us in here Theo [[01:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=4632.0s)]
*  I need to plug my wife [[01:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=4634.0s)]
*  Dumb blonde podcast, we'll put a link to it [[01:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=4636.0s)]
*  She's crushing man [[01:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=4638.0s)]
*  On Apple she's always in the top 10 on the comedy charts [[01:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=4640.0s)]
*  She really kills [[01:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=4642.0s)]
*  But Bunny just took me under [[01:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=4644.0s)]
*  Kind of took me under her wing [[01:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=4646.0s)]
*  What was it about her? [[01:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=4648.0s)]
*  I think she was just [[01:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=4652.0s)]
*  It was like a genuine thing the moment I met her [[01:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=4654.0s)]
*  I just knew [[01:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=4656.0s)]
*  You could feel the [[01:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=4658.0s)]
*  Ingenuineness from her [[01:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=4660.0s)]
*  And she was in a very ungenuine business [[01:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=4662.0s)]
*  Right? Like that business is [[01:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=4664.0s)]
*  Slimy, it's a lot of shucking [[01:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=4666.0s)]
*  It's a lot of game being ran on both ends [[01:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=4668.0s)]
*  She's running game, they're running game [[01:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=4670.0s)]
*  It's just a lot of game happening [[01:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=4672.0s)]
*  It was just [[01:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=4674.0s)]
*  I could just feel the authenticity [[01:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=4676.0s)]
*  In her though [[01:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=4678.0s)]
*  I hate to be the cliche like I felt it [[01:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=4680.0s)]
*  It was soul mates at sign [[01:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=4682.0s)]
*  But I felt that for real Bubba [[01:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=4684.0s)]
*  Like I felt that connection with her [[01:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=4686.0s)]
*  And how did you convince her to do it? [[01:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=4688.0s)]
*  Because she's living this lavish life [[01:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=4690.0s)]
*  She's living a more lavish life [[01:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=4692.0s)]
*  As a lot of those [[01:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=4694.0s)]
*  A lot of sex workers if they get dialed in on their business [[01:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=4696.0s)]
*  And they're business women as well [[01:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=4698.0s)]
*  Or business men if they gay workers [[01:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=4700.0s)]
*  Then they get [[01:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=4702.0s)]
*  They do real well [[01:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=4704.0s)]

*  That was supposed to work, I mean we're talking about a woman [[01:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=4754.0s)]
*  You know we're talking about an ex-drug dealer [[01:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=4756.0s)]

*  On a podcast that I spoke into existence [[01:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=4774.0s)]
*  Two calendar years ago [[01:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=4776.0s)]

*  I was like yo I'm from here, I need to get on the cast [[01:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=4792.0s)]
*  And here I sit, it's like not just because [[01:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=4794.0s)]

*  Yeah [[01:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=4804.0s)]
*  It was funny too, it's like you can [[01:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=4806.0s)]
*  Sometimes people are like I want to be on this and that [[01:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=4808.0s)]
*  And sometimes it just works out how it works out [[01:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=4810.0s)]
*  Sometimes you almost just have to have a time [[01:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=4812.0s)]
*  For me anyway where you feel like [[01:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=4814.0s)]
*  This person is in my life, I want to talk [[01:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=4816.0s)]
*  I saw you the other night at Brennan's show [[01:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=4818.0s)]
*  And I was like man I've just seen you a few times [[01:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=4820.0s)]
*  Where we've seen each other in different places [[01:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=4822.0s)]
*  And I'm like man every time [[01:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=4824.0s)]
*  That guy is just [[01:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=4826.0s)]
*  People want to be around that guy [[01:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=4828.0s)]
*  That guy just lights up the fucking room [[01:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=4830.0s)]
*  I just love people dude man [[01:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=4834.0s)]
*  And they love you [[01:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=4836.0s)]
*  I love them and I love you [[01:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=4838.0s)]
*  But it's like who would have thought that me and Bunny's story [[01:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=4840.0s)]
*  Would end up where it's at [[01:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=4842.0s)]
*  I think she did before I did [[01:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=4844.0s)]
*  And I think that's why she took the fucking [[01:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=4846.0s)]
*  The fucking pound puppy in [[01:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=4848.0s)]
*  I think she had even the vision I didn't at the time [[01:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=4850.0s)]
*  Oh yeah I'm sure you was drooling dude [[01:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=4852.0s)]
*  It was like homeo and drooly yet [[01:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=4854.0s)]
*  Homeo and drooly yet [[01:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=4856.0s)]
*  I tell people I didn't pick Bunny [[01:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=4858.0s)]
*  Bunny picked me [[01:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=4860.0s)]
*  She's the man in the situation [[01:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=4862.0s)]
*  I was just like yes I'll go out with you [[01:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=4864.0s)]
*  And that's just kind of how it worked [[01:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=4866.0s)]
*  That's awesome [[01:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=4868.0s)]
*  We've been together I think six years [[01:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=4870.0s)]
*  Going on seven years now [[01:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=4872.0s)]
*  And do you think y'all will have a child or not? [[01:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=4874.0s)]
*  I don't think so [[01:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=4876.0s)]
*  I don't think that's something that's in our [[01:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=4878.0s)]
*  Bunny didn't have a desire to birth a child [[01:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=4880.0s)]
*  But she always had a desire to be around children [[01:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=4882.0s)]
*  So I think that we kind of fed each other's needs [[01:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=4884.0s)]
*  I got custody of my daughter [[01:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=4886.0s)]
*  Right when I met Bunny [[01:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=4888.0s)]
*  Dude you know when somebody [[01:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=4890.0s)]
*  Grew up foreign white when somebody says [[01:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=4892.0s)]
*  I have custody [[01:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=4894.0s)]
*  The second the word custody hits the hair [[01:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=4896.0s)]
*  That's the most [[01:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=4898.0s)]
*  That was the word that I always heard [[01:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=4900.0s)]
*  Growing up [[01:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=4902.0s)]
*  I had custody [[01:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=4904.0s)]
*  I don't like telling this part [[01:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=4906.0s)]
*  I think she appreciates it now [[01:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=4908.0s)]
*  Her mother had a battle with a heroin addiction [[01:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=4910.0s)]
*  I had a fight with Bailey's mother [[01:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=4912.0s)]
*  My daughter [[01:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=4914.0s)]
*  And she's sober now back in Bailey's life [[01:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=4916.0s)]
*  Which is awesome [[01:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=4918.0s)]
*  But at the time it was bad [[01:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=4920.0s)]
*  Really really really true addict stuff bad [[01:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=4922.0s)]
*  So I was getting custody of Bailey [[01:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=4924.0s)]
*  Simultaneously courting Bunny [[01:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=4926.0s)]
*  All while some other girls like in week three [[01:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=4928.0s)]
*  Of being pregnant [[01:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=4930.0s)]
*  So it was like a really weird moment where Bunny [[01:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=4932.0s)]
*  Had every reason to run [[01:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=4934.0s)]
*  And instead she just fucking that bitch dug her heels in [[01:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=4936.0s)]
*  And was like let's fucking go [[01:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=4938.0s)]
*  I'm gonna catch it [[01:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=4940.0s)]
*  And we immediately [[01:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=4942.0s)]
*  Took custody of Bailey [[01:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=4944.0s)]
*  She started raising Bailey as her own [[01:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=4946.0s)]
*  To this day Bailey calls Bunny Mama [[01:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=4948.0s)]
*  And calls her mother Mom [[01:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=4950.0s)]
*  And her mother was in a same sex relationship [[01:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=4952.0s)]
*  She's gay [[01:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=4954.0s)]
*  So the other girl that raised Bailey from birth [[01:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=4956.0s)]
*  Is a part of it too so Bailey's got three moms [[01:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=4958.0s)]
*  You know what I mean [[01:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=4960.0s)]
*  That's the limit [[01:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=4962.0s)]
*  That's the legal limit [[01:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=4964.0s)]
*  I'm the only test [[01:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=4966.0s)]
*  I'm the only boss running the room besides Bunny [[01:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=4968.0s)]
*  Because she's a little aggressive sometimes [[01:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=4970.0s)]
*  But it's all fucking bitches and me [[01:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=4972.0s)]
*  But it works out great [[01:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=4974.0s)]
*  Do you have [[01:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=4976.0s)]
*  Tell me about one of the toughest times you guys had on the road [[01:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=4978.0s)]
*  You guys partied pretty hard I'm sure [[01:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=4980.0s)]
*  Was there a night where you didn't think you was gonna make it [[01:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=4982.0s)]
*  Any nights you ended up at the hospital [[01:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=4984.0s)]
*  Yeah I had a [[01:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=4986.0s)]
*  Cause I had a night man this is a few years back [[01:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=4988.0s)]
*  This is more than a few years back now [[01:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=4990.0s)]
*  But I was like sitting there [[01:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=4992.0s)]
*  And I was so close to going to the freaking emergency room [[01:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=4994.0s)]
*  My heart just rattling baby [[01:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=4996.0s)]
*  Just you know [[01:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=4998.0s)]
*  Like a cheerleader was shaking that bitch [[01:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=5000.0s)]
*  Mine was coding [[01:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=5002.0s)]
*  So it was the opposite [[01:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=5004.0s)]
*  It was going so slow [[01:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=5006.0s)]

*  Fag Fist Fights [[01:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=5322.0s)]

*  A gay men group [[01:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=5326.0s)]
*  And they came to different college towns [[01:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=5328.0s)]
*  And they'd put boxing ring at a bar [[01:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=5330.0s)]
*  And gay men would fight [[01:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=5332.0s)]

*  One of those right now [[01:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=5342.0s)]
*  It was crazy man I can't believe it [[01:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=5344.0s)]
*  They used to come to Hammond Louisiana [[01:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=5346.0s)]
*  They'd roll through probably twice a year [[01:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=5348.0s)]
*  And we'd go over there and watch it [[01:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=5350.0s)]
*  Did the midget wrestlers come through too? [[01:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=5352.0s)]
*  I always heard about that but I never saw that kind of shit [[01:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=5354.0s)]
*  Oh I do we got it here at the fairgrounds every other month [[01:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=5356.0s)]
*  It was the best dude [[01:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=5358.0s)]

*  So they had this thing at the fairgrounds where you ran out of this place [[01:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=5364.0s)]
*  Dude these fucking midgets dude [[01:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=5366.0s)]

*  They call themselves midgets [[01:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=5372.0s)]
*  They're called midget wrestlers [[01:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=5374.0s)]
*  The old school ones I think will say it [[01:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=5376.0s)]
*  But if they're fancier they won't say it [[01:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=5378.0s)]
*  Yeah the fancy midgets [[01:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=5380.0s)]
*  That makes sense [[01:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=5382.0s)]
*  The real trashy poor midgets are like midgets right? [[01:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=5384.0s)]
*  These were poor midgets then [[01:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=5386.0s)]
*  They used to do like double gainer backflips off the top rope [[01:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=5388.0s)]
*  It was some shit that like [[01:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=5390.0s)]
*  A couple of them guys should have went to the WWE [[01:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=5392.0s)]
*  Yeah [[01:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=5394.0s)]
*  I don't know why [[01:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=5396.0s)]
*  Well WWE missed that hole [[01:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=5398.0s)]
*  They never got into smaller folks being in there [[01:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=5400.0s)]
*  Rey Mysterio was like [[01:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=5402.0s)]
*  The closest thing right? [[01:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=5404.0s)]
*  Because he was like acrobatical [[01:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=5406.0s)]
*  I think they left the acrobatical shit to [[01:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=5408.0s)]
*  Lucha Libre wrestling [[01:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=5410.0s)]
*  Oh you go down to Mexico you see whatever dude [[01:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=5412.0s)]
*  Is that where the college is at Lucha Libre? [[01:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=5414.0s)]
*  I believe it could be [[01:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=5416.0s)]
*  Or is that the movie? [[01:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=5418.0s)]
*  It's called Lucha Libre yeah [[01:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=5420.0s)]
*  That wrestling was fucking [[01:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=5422.0s)]
*  People were doing backflips and shit [[01:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=5424.0s)]
*  I think that's what the midget wrestling was [[01:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=5426.0s)]
*  They couldn't break a table [[01:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=5428.0s)]
*  I mean they were so small man you'd have to cut the table down the middle before they even got on it [[01:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=5430.0s)]
*  Yeah they would cheat it off the bottom [[01:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=5432.0s)]
*  They would kind of bring it you know [[01:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=5434.0s)]
*  Saw in 3, 4 inch [[01:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=5436.0s)]
*  Do you know, was there any time y'all got hijacked or anything on the road or robbed? [[01:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=5438.0s)]
*  No we never had to deal with [[01:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=5440.0s)]
*  Nothing like that [[01:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=5442.0s)]
*  We got not paid a few times [[01:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=5444.0s)]
*  We stole some TVs out of venues [[01:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=5446.0s)]
*  We took pictures and art [[01:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=5448.0s)]
*  And all kinds of stuff [[01:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=5450.0s)]

*  It's just that thing above the urinal [[01:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=5454.0s)]
*  That says when there's a car [[01:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=5456.0s)]
*  When there's a car auction [[01:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=5458.0s)]
*  Manny's car auction [[01:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=5460.0s)]
*  I stole neon signs [[01:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=5462.0s)]
*  You know what I mean? I've done all that stuff [[01:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=5464.0s)]
*  I broke a window at a bar before [[01:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=5466.0s)]
*  Then they were like we got insurance [[01:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=5468.0s)]

*  Shit, why do they have all this stuff now [[01:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=5490.0s)]
*  Remember when you could find [[01:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=5492.0s)]
*  There was a 9 videos you could find [[01:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=5494.0s)]
*  It every time [[01:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=5496.0s)]
*  Jamie Liso, L-I-S-S-O-W [[01:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=5498.0s)]
*  I think it's him [[01:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=5500.0s)]
*  Oh there it is right there, comedian electrocuted on stage [[01:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=5504.0s)]
*  Oh you gotta play one more second [[01:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=5520.0s)]
*  It looks like he's standing there not touching it again [[01:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=5522.0s)]
*  Oh no [[01:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=5530.0s)]
*  Who really birthed him if he didn't try it again [[01:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=5532.0s)]
*  That's how enormous press were kind of hard [[01:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=5534.0s)]
*  That would have had to happen twice [[01:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=5536.0s)]
*  For sure I would have been like [[01:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=5538.0s)]
*  One first, sure [[01:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=5540.0s)]
*  One more time just like let me just see [[01:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=5542.0s)]
*  I'd be like that ain't real [[01:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=5544.0s)]
*  I stole a neon sign out of a bar though [[01:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=5546.0s)]
*  Did they ever not pay y'all [[01:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=5548.0s)]
*  Yeah but it was more like shady stuff [[01:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=5550.0s)]
*  Usually you get with the agent [[01:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=5552.0s)]
*  Before you can go get into the clubs [[01:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=5554.0s)]
*  Before that it's just weird rooms [[01:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=5556.0s)]
*  They had a guy who would [[01:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=5558.0s)]
*  It used to just be bringer shows [[01:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=5560.0s)]
*  Like you had to bring 8 people [[01:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=5562.0s)]
*  So you get there and you don't have anybody [[01:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=5564.0s)]
*  You can't perform [[01:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=5566.0s)]
*  How did you get picked up by an agent [[01:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=5568.0s)]
*  In your business [[01:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=5570.0s)]
*  I think you just start doing well [[01:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=5572.0s)]
*  You get about 10 minutes going and some manager sees you [[01:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=5574.0s)]
*  And then the manager connects you with an agent usually [[01:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=5576.0s)]
*  And they'll tell you [[01:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=5578.0s)]
*  Because you gotta feel like that's gotta be a hard business to break [[01:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=5580.0s)]
*  You just gotta be crushing [[01:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=5582.0s)]
*  Where did you cut your teeth at [[01:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=5584.0s)]
*  I cut a little bit in New Orleans and I cut them mostly honestly in LA [[01:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=5586.0s)]
*  I moved out there [[01:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=5588.0s)]
*  And I hadn't really performed much [[01:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=5590.0s)]
*  And I took a comedy class [[01:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=5592.0s)]
*  I went to a class and people always make fun of the classes [[01:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=5594.0s)]
*  And shit I went there [[01:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=5596.0s)]
*  And the best thing about the class was I hated the class [[01:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=5598.0s)]
*  I was like I'm better than everybody in here [[01:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=5600.0s)]
*  Even though I wasn't [[01:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=5602.0s)]
*  But in my head you're just like oh I'm cool [[01:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=5604.0s)]
*  And they had [[01:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=5606.0s)]
*  At the end of the class you get to get on stage and perform [[01:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=5610.0s)]
*  That was the graduation [[01:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=5612.0s)]
*  You were in front of a full room [[01:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=5614.0s)]
*  And you got a 3 minute tape you got your tape [[01:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=5616.0s)]
*  And my tape was decent so then you go around to other places [[01:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=5618.0s)]
*  And then [[01:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=5620.0s)]
*  Next you know it's 5 years later [[01:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=5622.0s)]
*  And you're [[01:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=5624.0s)]
*  Starting to travel around and do it [[01:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=5626.0s)]
*  And then it's 10 years later [[01:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=5628.0s)]
*  At that time I think around 10 years [[01:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=5630.0s)]
*  I thought about quitting I moved back home for about 4 or 5 months [[01:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=5632.0s)]
*  Really [[01:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=5634.0s)]
*  What encouraged you to get back [[01:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=5636.0s)]
*  I don't know [[01:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=5638.0s)]
*  I broke up my girlfriend [[01:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=5640.0s)]
*  I broke up [[01:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=5642.0s)]
*  I don't know I was at home [[01:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=5644.0s)]
*  I was working at a Mexican restaurant [[01:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=5646.0s)]
*  Bartending at a Mexican restaurant [[01:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=5648.0s)]
*  I was not a good bartender [[01:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=5650.0s)]
*  I broke some equipment [[01:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=5652.0s)]
*  And I fucking [[01:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=5654.0s)]
*  I still might owe those people an amends [[01:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=5656.0s)]
*  But I broke some damn equipment there [[01:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=5658.0s)]
*  One of them margarita makers [[01:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=5660.0s)]
*  That bitch I was trying to put it back together late at night [[01:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=5662.0s)]
*  And I couldn't figure it out [[01:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=5664.0s)]
*  And I broke that bitch [[01:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=5666.0s)]
*  The guy they were upset [[01:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=5668.0s)]
*  I don't know at that point I felt like [[01:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=5670.0s)]
*  There was no reason for me really to stay [[01:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=5672.0s)]
*  I think I kind of hinged my bets on this girl [[01:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=5674.0s)]
*  So when that fell apart [[01:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=5676.0s)]
*  I felt like I didn't know what to do [[01:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=5678.0s)]
*  And then I went back I guess that's what happened [[01:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=5680.0s)]
*  Who all did you feature for early [[01:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=5682.0s)]
*  That's a good question man [[01:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=5684.0s)]
*  I feature for this one guy named Mark Lundholm [[01:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=5686.0s)]
*  And sober guy [[01:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=5690.0s)]
*  Super funny dude [[01:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=5692.0s)]
*  But he smokes cigars right [[01:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=5694.0s)]
*  He's a good guy [[01:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=5696.0s)]
*  But he smokes cigars right [[01:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=5698.0s)]
*  And we got stuck up in [[01:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=5700.0s)]
*  Notre Dame of Mishawaka, Indiana [[01:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=5702.0s)]
*  Oh yeah right outside of South Bend [[01:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=5704.0s)]
*  Right outside of South Bend man [[01:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=5706.0s)]
*  We even went over and saw the bar where Rudy would sit at [[01:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=5708.0s)]
*  And sit in his seat and stuff it was real cool [[01:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=5710.0s)]
*  But we were stuck indoors [[01:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=5712.0s)]
*  It was 30 degrees we were stuck indoors [[01:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=5714.0s)]
*  And we were sharing a little condo or house [[01:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=5716.0s)]
*  And he smoked cigars [[01:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=5718.0s)]
*  And I was like hey do you mind [[01:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=5720.0s)]
*  Not smoking indoors [[01:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=5722.0s)]
*  And he's like I'm going to be smoking [[01:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=5724.0s)]
*  And that bitch would smoke two cigars before he'd go to sleep I think [[01:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=5726.0s)]
*  Yeah he was just lighting them off for each other [[01:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=5728.0s)]
*  Yeah yeah and if I'm wrong Mark [[01:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=5730.0s)]
*  I'm sorry but that's just how I remembered [[01:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=5732.0s)]
*  And you know [[01:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=5734.0s)]
*  They had a guy Tom Rhodes too who I love [[01:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=5736.0s)]
*  Who I got to have on here sometime [[01:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=5738.0s)]
*  And he used to smoke Marlboro Reds [[01:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=5740.0s)]
*  And he and I had to share a place in Shreveport one time [[01:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=5742.0s)]
*  And I remember asking him I said hey man we might not smoke indoors [[01:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=5744.0s)]
*  He goes I'm going to smoke indoors [[01:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=5746.0s)]
*  I think he lit one right up there he might have lit two up [[01:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=5748.0s)]
*  He lit two up I think it made me hold one [[01:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=5750.0s)]
*  One more question because I got to ask [[01:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=5752.0s)]
*  That's why I got you [[01:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=5754.0s)]
*  Why did you probably tell it a thousand times [[01:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=5756.0s)]
*  What was your worst or most memorable bomb? [[01:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=5758.0s)]
*  Hmm [[01:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=5760.0s)]
*  I mean I've had one [[01:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=5762.0s)]
*  That I've told where I just kept [[01:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=5764.0s)]
*  I bombed and they didn't know that I had to come back out [[01:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=5766.0s)]
*  Between each act [[01:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=5768.0s)]
*  It was like a battle of the bands [[01:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=5770.0s)]
*  So they booed me off in the beginning [[01:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=5772.0s)]
*  I burned my material so fast because they hated me [[01:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=5774.0s)]
*  But I had to keep coming back out [[01:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=5776.0s)]
*  And it was horrible [[01:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=5778.0s)]
*  At one point I came out with an American flag [[01:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=5780.0s)]
*  I was like [[01:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=5782.0s)]
*  I didn't know what to do [[01:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=5784.0s)]
*  This has to bring unity [[01:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=5786.0s)]
*  I didn't know what [[01:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=5788.0s)]
*  I didn't have any material left [[01:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=5790.0s)]
*  And I had to do like another probably 20 minutes [[01:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=5792.0s)]
*  And the best part was [[01:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=5794.0s)]
*  Towards the end I would kind of sneak [[01:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=5796.0s)]
*  Like I was going to come back out [[01:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=5798.0s)]
*  And they were like there's no way he's coming back out [[01:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=5800.0s)]
*  And I would just come back out [[01:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=5802.0s)]
*  And they would just die laughing [[01:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=5804.0s)]
*  Because they couldn't believe [[01:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=5806.0s)]
*  One time I went out and was saying smooth criminal [[01:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=5808.0s)]
*  I didn't even fucking know the words [[01:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=5810.0s)]
*  Half of it was man in the mirror [[01:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=5816.0s)]
*  I didn't even know the fucking words [[01:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=5818.0s)]
*  And that shit man [[01:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=5826.0s)]
*  Oh but at the time bro [[01:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=5828.0s)]
*  I felt bad even asking them [[01:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=5830.0s)]
*  To pay me [[01:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=5832.0s)]
*  I just wanted to leave [[01:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=5834.0s)]
*  And it's such a dichotomy [[01:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=5836.0s)]
*  Leaving a place when you've crushed it [[01:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=5838.0s)]
*  And that feeling of bravado and I did good [[01:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=5840.0s)]
*  Then that other feeling [[01:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=5842.0s)]
*  Of leaving when you did not [[01:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=5844.0s)]
*  And still having to get to your vehicle [[01:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=5846.0s)]
*  Get to Lee and you know you're going to run into people [[01:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=5848.0s)]
*  And you just feel that energy [[01:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=5850.0s)]
*  People just turned it out [[01:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=5852.0s)]
*  Jelly roll man [[01:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=5854.0s)]
*  I appreciate the time man [[01:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=5856.0s)]
*  I feel like we covered a lot of stuff do you? [[01:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=5858.0s)]
*  You feel like we covered a lot of stuff? [[01:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=5860.0s)]

*  When you Frankenstein I think it will be the funniest shit ever [[01:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=5864.0s)]
*  What is it? [[01:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=5866.0s)]
*  I don't even know [[01:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=5868.0s)]
*  I don't know either man [[01:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=5872.0s)]
*  I'm just trying to stay alive [[01:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=5874.0s)]

*  Everything mattered [[01:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=5916.0s)]
*  Is what I tell people everything you're going through [[01:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=5918.0s)]
*  Right now in your career if you're [[01:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=5920.0s)]

*  And then there's like a small tipping point that happens [[01:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQ3D4TyLqQ&t=5928.0s)]
