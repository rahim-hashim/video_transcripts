*  I had a camouflage hoodie as well. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=296.98s)]
*  So, yeah, you really... [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=300.14s)]
*  Did you guys hunt anything? [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=301.66s)]
*  Do you know, so I lived on a lake for the first year [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=303.5s)]
*  and I bought a fishing rod from Walmart because I was like, I'm going to go fishing. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=306.90000000000003s)]
*  I've never been fishing before. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=310.46000000000004s)]
*  And I sat, I threw it in. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=311.66s)]
*  And then after about an hour, my mate came up and was like, have you put bait on it? [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=313.26s)]
*  And I was like... [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=316.38s)]
*  I didn't know you were going to do that. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=318.06s)]
*  So I just sat with the fishing rod. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=319.14s)]
*  Really? [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=321.38s)]
*  In the lake, yeah. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=321.82s)]
*  Oh, like a panamime fishing. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=322.7s)]
*  I just assumed a fish would like swim past and catch the hook. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=324.09999999999997s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=327.26s)]
*  I'd never fish before, you know. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=328.38s)]
*  It wasn't something I'd grown up doing. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=329.85999999999996s)]
*  You got to have that... [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=331.65999999999997s)]
*  You got to put something on there. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=332.5s)]
*  I know that now. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=335.62s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=336.53999999999996s)]
*  I know that now. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=336.97999999999996s)]
*  Wow, I've never heard of anybody doing that. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=337.62s)]
*  Would you... [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=340.09999999999997s)]
*  Maybe a child or something or a blind fella. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=340.38s)]
*  Well, I feel like in some ways, I am quite... [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=343.02s)]
*  I feel like your age freezes, the age that you become famous, I think. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=347.02s)]
*  So I think in some ways, I am still a teenager. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=351.74s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=353.78s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=354.34s)]
*  Oh, that's interesting. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=354.74s)]
*  Yeah, I think it's like... [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=355.9s)]
*  And I think some creative people just grow... [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=357.46s)]
*  They kind of grow up slow, I feel like, in a way. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=359.46s)]
*  Well, you sort of don't have the same... [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=362.29999999999995s)]
*  I don't know, brutal life lessons, I guess. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=367.53999999999996s)]
*  When I was like... [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=370.65999999999997s)]
*  I moved to London when I was like 17. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=371.46s)]
*  And I was having regular brutal life lessons of just like, [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=373.70000000000005s)]
*  no, this is what the real world is. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=376.78000000000003s)]
*  And then I think when you, you know, started doing well about 20, about 19, 20, [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=378.06s)]
*  and then you sort of like, if you make a mistake, it's kind of all right. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=385.1s)]
*  You know, you don't have like the brutal real life lesson, I guess. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=391.66s)]
*  What do you mean like when you're doing... [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=395.46000000000004s)]
*  When life is... [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=396.74s)]
*  When you have like a success and stuff going on, is that what you mean? [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=397.5s)]
*  Kind of... [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=400.46000000000004s)]
*  Well, yeah, I mean, you will know this with comedy, [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=400.94s)]
*  like a brutal life lesson of like, it's not going to be easy, [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=403.98s)]
*  is bombing or playing to an empty room or blah, blah, blah. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=407.02s)]
*  That kind of stops happening when you have success. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=409.82s)]
*  There's definitely you have peaks and troughs in your career [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=412.3s)]
*  where people are more interested or less interested, [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=414.38s)]
*  but you don't have the like... [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=418.3s)]
*  I don't know, I don't think you have as many normal life lessons. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=421.18s)]
*  You still get quite abnormal life lessons, I think, [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=425.18s)]
*  because in the sort of celebrity sphere, it can be quite abnormal, [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=427.5s)]
*  but you don't have the like, I don't know, regular stuff. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=431.74s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=436.22s)]
*  Does that make sense? [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=436.46s)]
*  Yeah, I think it does, dude. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=437.34s)]
*  I am the worst person to ask if something makes sense or not, to be honest with you. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=439.9s)]
*  Yeah, every time people ask... [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=443.66s)]
*  My mate's just so excited that I'm doing this today, by the way. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=444.94s)]
*  Who is? [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=447.18s)]
*  All of my friends. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=447.74s)]
*  Oh, really? [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=448.46s)]
*  Yeah, the guy that... [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=449.42s)]
*  There's a guy living at our house at the moment, [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=450.38s)]
*  and he was like trying to get off work to just come down and just say hi. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=453.66s)]
*  Oh, and just mill around? [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=457.58000000000004s)]
*  Like a loitering, they call it. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=458.94s)]
*  I think you guys, loitering must be a British thing, [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=460.78000000000003s)]
*  because we wouldn't say that, loitering. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=463.18s)]
*  What would you say? [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=465.02000000000004s)]
*  We'd be like, oh yeah, stalking. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=465.82000000000005s)]
*  Well, stalking is more like once you've loitered and you see something in the window, [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=468.06s)]
*  you know, you see something, you see a bit of tits in the distance or something. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=471.34000000000003s)]
*  But yeah, that's stalking. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=477.18s)]
*  And then it's breaking and entering, you know, and then it's marriage, usually. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=478.94000000000005s)]
*  Yeah, if you have a way with words, I think. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=484.62s)]
*  But yeah, I think... [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=487.98s)]
*  Are you married? [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=489.02000000000004s)]
*  Loitering sounds very British. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=490.70000000000005s)]
*  No, no, I'm not married. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=492.22s)]
*  I would like to be kind of... [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=494.62s)]
*  I guess you have to loiter more for that to happen. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=495.98s)]
*  Yeah, I need a bit more loitering. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=497.66s)]
*  Yeah, I need to bring the binoculars, you know? [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=498.86s)]
*  Maybe bring a Red Bull. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=501.02000000000004s)]
*  That's the loiterer you got to really be aware of. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=502.46000000000004s)]
*  The Red Bull loiterer. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=504.86s)]
*  Yeah, just standing there with the Red Bull. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=505.82000000000005s)]
*  Small sips. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=507.98s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=508.62s)]
*  Small sips. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=509.66s)]
*  I can tell. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=510.70000000000005s)]
*  I haven't had Red Bull in years, man. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=511.26000000000005s)]
*  Probably good for you. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=513.1s)]
*  There was a time when I was doing loads and loads of breakfast TVs and radios and stuff like that. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=515.5799999999999s)]
*  It used to be those massive monster drinks. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=520.4599999999999s)]
*  When you were touring to get your singles out there and stuff like that? [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=522.22s)]
*  Used to kind of have to turn up at like 3.30 AM to a German weather program [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=524.6999999999999s)]
*  to play 30 seconds of your new singles. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=530.6999999999999s)]
*  So like those stages, yeah. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=532.6999999999999s)]
*  Chance of rain, but chance of Ed Sheeran first. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=534.4599999999999s)]
*  I remember so clearly playing. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=537.66s)]
*  I got up at like... [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=539.74s)]
*  They were doing it in some like theme park in the middle of Germany, [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=541.1800000000001s)]
*  and it was just obviously empty because it was like 4 AM. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=543.82s)]
*  And I start playing on this thing, on this weather program, [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=548.14s)]
*  and then I can see the credits rolling underneath me like 10 seconds in, [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=551.42s)]
*  and I'm like, I'm like the fucking play out music. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=554.78s)]
*  And then they just stopped it. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=557.58s)]
*  So I played 10 seconds of my new single basically. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=558.46s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=560.38s)]
*  Germany was a tough market for me for a while, [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=562.62s)]
*  and then the egg was cracked and now we're good. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=564.94s)]
*  You think they'd take a look at you and be like, [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=568.54s)]
*  oh, he could be one of us, you know? [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=570.62s)]
*  I feel like you look like a closet German. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=572.38s)]
*  Is that fair to say to somebody? [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=576.38s)]
*  I don't even know. I'm just loitering. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=577.42s)]
*  No, I think, well, the red hair is more Celtic, [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=578.54s)]
*  so I'd say the Scottish or Irish or like the Norwegians, I think, [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=581.5799999999999s)]
*  would look at me and be like, you want to... [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=586.78s)]
*  There's some Viking. You got a bit of Viking in you. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=588.62s)]
*  We'll take them. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=590.62s)]
*  Yeah, I might have a little bit like off. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=591.74s)]
*  You'll see me in like the frozen food area kind of like in the store, you know? [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=593.5s)]
*  I'm mill about in there, you know? [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=598.0600000000001s)]
*  Loiter. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=599.58s)]
*  You know? [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=601.5s)]
*  What's your background heritage? Have you got European? [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=602.38s)]
*  I'm Polish. Yeah, Nicaragua. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=605.58s)]
*  My dad was from Nicaragua. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=607.74s)]
*  His parents met down there and he was born there. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=609.9000000000001s)]

*  American sport, I find really... [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=880.54s)]
*  I love watching American sport, but there's no penalty for being bad. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=883.42s)]
*  You just get given more money in first draft. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=888.78s)]
*  So you have your teams. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=891.42s)]
*  And then if someone's bad, they go to the bottom, they get first draft, [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=893.3399999999999s)]
*  they can get better again. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=895.5s)]
*  Here, if you're bad, you're out of the league. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=896.4599999999999s)]
*  You're just out. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=898.78s)]
*  And you go into a league that's not on television, [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=899.5799999999999s)]
*  and you have to like fight to get back up into the league that's on television. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=901.42s)]
*  And if you're bad in that, you go to a lower league. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=904.38s)]
*  My football team, like for the past six years, have not been on television [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=906.22s)]
*  until we were in the third division two years ago. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=912.22s)]
*  And we've just finally got back up to the Premier League. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=915.34s)]
*  But it's more exciting. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=918.14s)]
*  It's unpredictable. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=919.9s)]
*  Whereas like, I'm a big Tennessee Titans fan, and they're kind of always... [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=920.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=924.78s)]
*  You know, they're pretty mid. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=925.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=926.62s)]
*  Yeah, but you know what? [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=927.4200000000001s)]
*  Even in the game itself, I didn't realize that till you just said that. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=928.14s)]
*  It's more unpredictable in the game. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=930.86s)]
*  It's like with soccer, like you can get the ball back in a moment. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=932.86s)]
*  So you could suddenly be in offense. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=937.02s)]
*  But in the NFL, it's like... [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=938.62s)]
*  It's very tactical. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=940.62s)]
*  Yeah, you know it's going to be a little while before you get the ball back, you know? [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=941.5s)]
*  And then there's going to be some... [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=944.94s)]
*  And if you drop your guard in soccer for five minutes, your team can be... [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=945.5s)]
*  Like there was one World Cup that was in Brazil, [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=950.54s)]
*  and Brazil were arguably the best team at that time. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=954.78s)]
*  And Germany ended up beating them 7-1, [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=959.34s)]
*  just because there was like 20 minutes of them letting their guard down. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=961.34s)]
*  Yeah, that was insane, but I remember that. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=964.62s)]
*  I was in Vegas actually when I was watching it. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=967.1800000000001s)]
*  That's where I met you in Vegas. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=970.22s)]
*  Man, that was a crazy night. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=972.14s)]
*  Fucking hell. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=973.34s)]
*  What was that? [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=973.82s)]
*  Because like the chains hookers were just supposed to be performing, right? [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=974.46s)]
*  I had gone... [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=977.34s)]
*  I was doing my final tour show. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=978.14s)]
*  So we basically were meant to play the Allegiant Stadium in August, [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=979.82s)]
*  and we'd set up our whole... [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=984.38s)]
*  I have an in the round stage, and we have these massive pylons [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=986.46s)]
*  that basically hang up all the speakers and screens and stuff like that, [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=989.82s)]
*  and it's weighted, so everything has to be exactly the same weight. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=994.3000000000001s)]
*  And in a regular stadium, it's a concrete floor. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=997.9000000000001s)]
*  You put them in, they stay there. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1000.94s)]
*  We didn't realize that Allegiant Stadium didn't have a concrete floor. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1002.46s)]
*  I don't know where that misalignment happened, but anyways, we put it in. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1005.74s)]
*  It has a rubber floor, and the stage was slowly slipping. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1011.1800000000001s)]
*  And these are like, you know, tons and tons and tons and tons of steel [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1014.5400000000001s)]
*  would have fallen on people. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1018.46s)]
*  So we had to cancel the gig 20 minutes before it started. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1019.5s)]
*  And Vegas isn't a place where like people, [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1023.34s)]
*  like 80,000 people that live in Vegas are going to go. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1025.9s)]
*  People had flown in, they got hotels, and so hot. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1028.3s)]
*  It was like one of the worst days on tour. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1031.1s)]
*  It was just... [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1034.54s)]
*  It was grim. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1035.1s)]
*  So we rescheduled the Allegiant Stadium gig for then. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1035.9s)]
*  So that was my final show of the tour. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1039.5s)]
*  And yeah, we got pretty fucking lit up afterwards, and that's where I saw you. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1042.22s)]
*  I know the Chainsmokers, so I sort of turned up and then... [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1048.46s)]
*  Yeah, they're great. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1051.5s)]
*  Kind of turned into karaoke. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1052.14s)]
*  I was sort of thinking if you'd spent money on like a VIP table that night, [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1054.14s)]
*  see the Chainsmokers, and then suddenly just there's drunk me on stage in an Avengers mask. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1057.3400000000001s)]
*  And here's the thing, man. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1064.8600000000001s)]
*  People knew it was you. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1065.98s)]
*  Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1067.66s)]
*  I think at first... [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1068.94s)]
*  I was very aware that like I was just wearing the mask because they were wearing it. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1069.9s)]
*  It was Halloween, remember? [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1073.26s)]
*  It was Halloween. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1074.14s)]
*  Yeah, let's say that. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1074.7s)]
*  So do you know those guys? [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1076.86s)]
*  Yeah, I just know them from like seeing them at different shows [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1078.46s)]
*  and being around them and stuff like that, [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1080.78s)]
*  but their energy is always fun and good, you know? [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1081.8999999999999s)]
*  And like I just love getting to spend time with them. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1084.1399999999999s)]
*  Their shows are always fun. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1088.3s)]
*  Like I go to their show sometimes. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1089.58s)]
*  I'll go to Diplo. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1090.94s)]
*  When I go to Fred again recently, [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1092.3s)]
*  I like going to see what some of the DJs are like, you know? [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1094.54s)]
*  But then you got up and it seemed like you were going to maybe do one song. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1098.1399999999999s)]
*  And I was like, how are they going to get... [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1100.3s)]
*  Are they going to go to like a little bit more ballad? [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1101.6599999999999s)]
*  What are they going to do? [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1103.8999999999999s)]
*  And then by like four songs later, it's just a... [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1105.02s)]
*  It's a... [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1108.46s)]
*  It's your show, man. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1109.98s)]
*  That was it, dude. [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1111.1000000000001s)]
*  Four songs later and it's just a... [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1112.7s)]
*  It's an itch here and people are just kissing and there's doves and stuff. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1114.46s)]
*  So where do we get a bunch of fucking doves? [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1118.8600000000001s)]
*  You know, it was very interesting, I felt like. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1121.98s)]
*  People making wishes and stuff and hugging their grandmothers. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1125.18s)]
*  Are you going to go to any of the World Cup games in 26 in America? [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1128.06s)]
*  I probably will. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1132.14s)]
*  And that's soccer, yeah? [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1133.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1134.38s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1134.78s)]
*  I'll probably get over to some of them. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1135.42s)]
*  Our soccer has been pretty bad, man. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1137.1s)]
*  Our country is going through a lot, I'll be honest with you. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1139.74s)]
*  It's one of the reasons why I'm over here. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1142.54s)]
*  Have you not noticed ours is too? [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1146.06s)]
*  I feel like English people and Americans, they always... [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1147.8999999999999s)]
*  They're like, oh, do you know what? [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1152.06s)]
*  The other place is better. [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1153.02s)]
*  And then you go to the other place and you're like, oh, it's kind of... [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1153.98s)]
*  I feel like the world is going through quite a lot. [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1155.74s)]
*  Like we travel a lot and it's like election time all around the world. [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1158.22s)]
*  And everywhere I go, I'm like, oh, it's kind of the same here as well. [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1161.26s)]
*  I feel like everyone is going through a shift of some sort. [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1164.14s)]
*  Oh, that's a good point. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1167.0200000000002s)]
*  You guys elections are happening right now, huh? [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1168.14s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1170.14s)]
*  Yeah, it's pretty bonkers some of the shit that's coming out. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1171.1000000000001s)]
*  You're sort of watching these interviews being like, [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1175.42s)]
*  does your brain connect to your mouth? [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1178.0600000000002s)]
*  I sometimes feel like people don't want to get elected. [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1180.14s)]
*  But they're saying stuff to just be like, now I'm done, man. [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1182.94s)]
*  I'm done. [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1184.94s)]
*  It's mad. [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1185.66s)]
*  Well, I'm sure there's probably times you get halfway into something, [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1186.14s)]
*  you're like, I don't know about this. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1188.94s)]
*  Like people get stage fright at the altar all the time sometimes, [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1191.5s)]
*  or sometimes you'll buy something at the market [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1194.86s)]
*  and you'll put it back on the like... [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1196.78s)]
*  With the gums or the candies or something, [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1198.46s)]
*  you put like just a pack of like sausages back there or something. [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1200.3s)]
*  So I think that there's... [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1203.5s)]
*  That's if there's knocking there's someone doing work next door, by the way. [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1205.5s)]
*  As long as it's not an indentured servant, I think we're good. [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1209.1s)]
*  Just because Britain's had their history. [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1213.26s)]
*  And I'm not saying America didn't polish it up a little, [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1216.3799999999999s)]
*  but we've all, you know, we've all sinned a little. [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1218.62s)]
*  Or we didn't, but forefathers definitely, you know, had some crazy plans. [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1221.26s)]
*  Yeah, dude, but yeah, it's nice to be over here. [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1227.58s)]
*  I like some... [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1229.6599999999999s)]
*  Like I listen to James Blake. [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1230.3799999999999s)]
*  I like his music a lot, you know. [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1231.82s)]
*  So I'll listen to some James Blake and... [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1233.82s)]
*  Yeah, I'll listen to Fred again. [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1237.34s)]
*  What other kind of I'm trying to think of British music do I listen to? [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1239.58s)]
*  Oh, nice day for a wide wedding. [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1244.4599999999998s)]
*  Oh, cool, yeah. [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1248.06s)]
*  That guy, you know him? [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1249.1s)]
*  No, I don't. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1250.94s)]
*  I mean, I know this song. [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1251.74s)]
*  I don't know him. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1252.62s)]
*  Start again. [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1254.1399999999999s)]
*  Who's your... [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1257.02s)]
*  Every little sister. [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1257.58s)]
*  Maybe that's not the lyric. [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1259.5s)]
*  That seems a little bit perverse. [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1260.46s)]
*  Who's your NFL team then? [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1261.1799999999998s)]
*  Oh, sorry. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1263.1s)]
*  I'm a Saints, New Orleans Saints fan. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1263.5s)]
*  Are you from New Orleans then? [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1265.1s)]
*  Yeah, that's where I'm from out of Louisiana. [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1266.1399999999999s)]
*  So why move to Nashville? [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1267.6599999999999s)]
*  Well, I lived in LA for a while and then Nashville was open during the pandemic. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1269.26s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1273.5s)]
*  You could do what you want. [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1273.98s)]
*  You could spit on people and they were still okay with it. [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1275.02s)]
*  It's a good criteria to move to a town. [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1283.02s)]
*  Just be like, can I spit on people? [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1284.62s)]
*  Or you could just... [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1287.34s)]
*  I mean, you couldn't even... [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1290.22s)]
*  Yeah, just that mask. [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1291.74s)]
*  When you think about what the mask... [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1293.5s)]
*  I will say this though. [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1297.34s)]
*  You could look at somebody and kind of lick your lips in a way [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1298.22s)]
*  that you wouldn't normally be able to. [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1300.86s)]
*  And that's something I miss. [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1303.02s)]
*  Just being point blank. [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1305.1s)]
*  I like the fact... [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1306.54s)]
*  I really love public transport and I can move around easier now since COVID [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1308.78s)]
*  because wearing a ski mask is not seen as creepy. [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1313.18s)]
*  People just... [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1316.46s)]
*  You're just sort of in a ski mask. [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1316.86s)]
*  Oh, that's a good point. [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1317.9s)]
*  You're just still in one. [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1318.3799999999999s)]
*  Every now and then, if I go in the airport now [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1319.82s)]
*  and I'll just wear one of those long neck ones, you know? [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1321.74s)]
*  And I definitely feel like, oh, people are like, [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1325.1s)]
*  who's the weirdo still with the neck and the glasses and the hat? [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1326.7s)]
*  And I'll even put a wig on sometimes and like, who the hell? [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1330.7s)]
*  Is this lady trying to... [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1335.18s)]
*  Wigs are a good idea. [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1336.06s)]
*  Yeah, trying to get laid or whatever. [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1337.02s)]
*  I sometimes decided dressing up as Santa Claus [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1338.78s)]
*  when I went to the supermarket at Christmas [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1340.86s)]
*  because I was like, I really need to go and get Christmas supplies [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1342.78s)]
*  but the supermarket is obviously really busy at Christmas [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1345.82s)]
*  and I'm not like... [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1348.06s)]
*  I don't blend in that well and I was like, [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1350.46s)]
*  if I dressed up as Santa Claus, maybe that'd be fine. [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1352.1399999999999s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1354.3799999999999s)]
*  Walk in, get your Christmas supplies. [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1354.94s)]
*  Everyone's like, Santa's here, you know? [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1357.02s)]
*  Did I see that? [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1359.82s)]
*  There's no way I saw you sharing a Santa Claus buying bagels. [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1360.54s)]
*  Um, did you see that fighter that looked like you the other day? [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1363.5800000000002s)]
*  It was like on a UFC fight or something? [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1366.94s)]
*  Oh my God, yeah. [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1368.46s)]
*  Well, I mean, he is a lookalike. [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1369.74s)]
*  He's... [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1372.46s)]
*  Oh, he is. [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1372.78s)]
*  Did you not see the thing where there was the Floyd Mayweather... [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1373.9s)]
*  No, the KSI Logan Paul fight and I was like... [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1376.8600000000001s)]
*  I was ringsized but it was this lookalike [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1381.02s)]
*  and some YouTubers had done a thing where they were like, [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1383.5s)]
*  let's try and fool them and they got this lookalike [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1386.3s)]
*  and Eddie Hearn essentially just gave my lookalike ringside tickets [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1388.54s)]
*  the only way that he was found out was Justin Bieber turned up [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1393.74s)]
*  and was like, that's not it. [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1396.62s)]
*  Wow. [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1398.46s)]
*  And yeah. [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1398.78s)]
*  But yeah, I did see it. [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1400.3799999999999s)]
*  I did see it. [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1401.82s)]
*  Did you see the Eddie Hall one? [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1402.3799999999999s)]
*  No, I didn't see it. [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1404.1399999999999s)]
*  What is it? [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1404.86s)]
*  Can we watch it? [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1405.18s)]
*  Can we get the Eddie Hall one up? [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1405.66s)]
*  Because look, I just... [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1407.5s)]
*  The other night I was going through, it was on TikTok or something. [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1408.46s)]
*  The other night... [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1410.86s)]
*  So this is the same fight. [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1411.42s)]
*  The same fight. [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1412.46s)]
*  And it pulls up, you know? [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1413.26s)]
*  Just go on the shorter one, like the real. [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1414.62s)]
*  Down... [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1417.74s)]
*  Oh, sorry, the shorts. [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1418.1399999999999s)]
*  Just down... [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1419.26s)]

*  Just two on one. [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1423.74s)]
*  Oh my gosh, huh? [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1425.26s)]
*  And are those the island boys? [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1427.26s)]
*  Oh, what? [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1429.58s)]
*  Jedward. [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1429.98s)]

*  Just take the sleeping pill. [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1443.82s)]
*  That was the same night, I think, that my lookalike was doing the fight. [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1445.26s)]
*  Well, this is what it's coming to. [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1450.3799999999999s)]
*  That's good, boys. [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1451.5s)]
*  We get it. [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1452.22s)]
*  I don't think... [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1452.54s)]
*  This is what it's coming to. [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1453.74s)]
*  No, Ed, I'm just going to let you know. [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1454.7s)]
*  This is the kind of thing that it's coming to. [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1456.22s)]
*  You're going to have like, you know, freckled stepmother versus like, [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1459.5s)]

*  It's getting... [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1470.06s)]
*  That's where it's all going to be bet. [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1471.42s)]
*  It's just constant betting. [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1472.94s)]
*  I think you can feel it coming up in the world. [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1474.38s)]
*  It's like... [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1476.14s)]
*  Would you do one of them? [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1476.54s)]
*  Hmm. [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1478.46s)]
*  Against a male or female, you think? [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1480.1399999999999s)]
*  Against Caleb. [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1488.1399999999999s)]
*  Oh, against Caleb Presley? [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1489.34s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1490.54s)]
*  Oh, man. [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1491.02s)]

*  I had a good night with Caleb. [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1498.62s)]
*  Did you? [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1499.58s)]
*  I was just with him in Lisbon yesterday. [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1499.98s)]
*  Yeah, he's fun. [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1501.8999999999999s)]
*  My friend got married and we went to Lisbon. [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1502.6999999999998s)]
*  I went over there to see him. [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1506.46s)]
*  Caleb came to our show in Dublin and then we went over there. [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1507.74s)]
*  It was really cool. [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1510.1399999999999s)]
*  Lisbon's amazing. [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1510.94s)]
*  Lisbon is amazing. [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1511.8999999999999s)]
*  Lisbon's amazing. [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1512.62s)]
*  Oh, Caleb's great though, dude. [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1513.34s)]
*  He's very smart, mischievous. [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1514.62s)]
*  He likes to like... [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1517.82s)]
*  Who do you think wins? [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1519.1s)]
*  Between me and Caleb? [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1520.54s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1521.74s)]
*  That's a great question. [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1522.1399999999999s)]
*  You and him both get in a cage. [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1523.82s)]
*  You put on those little gloves. [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1525.02s)]
*  But how little the gloves... [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1527.18s)]
*  Here's what I think you should do. [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1528.46s)]
*  Gloves that are way too small. [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1529.5s)]
*  Not just gloves that are like weighted gloves, but like extra small. [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1531.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1535.02s)]
*  And then your hands are like this, you know? [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1535.42s)]
*  And then you have to fight. [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1537.3400000000001s)]
*  Did you ever fight at school? [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1539.98s)]
*  Did you do wrestling and stuff? [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1541.5800000000002s)]
*  I've gotten beat. [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1542.7s)]
*  I got beaten a decent amount as a lad, I remember. [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1543.42s)]
*  I remember at our school, if you got in a fight during school, [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1547.5s)]
*  this is what they made you do. [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1550.6200000000001s)]
*  You had to stand in the hall, whoever you fought, [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1551.9s)]
*  and you had to put your hands on each other's shoulders [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1554.38s)]
*  for the rest of the day and just be there and looking at each other and talking. [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1556.78s)]
*  So by the end of the day, you were friends with whoever you fought, you know? [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1559.9s)]
*  And all the kids would come down the hall between class and call you a wanker or whatever. [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1563.1000000000001s)]
*  That sounds actually quite a good way to solve problems. [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1568.7800000000002s)]
*  I thought it was. [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1570.7800000000002s)]
*  Because it was no, by the end of the day, [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1571.74s)]
*  you had to make each other laugh or figure out what went on. [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1573.66s)]
*  And you realized that like, yeah, you're probably similar. [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1576.22s)]
*  Similar, yeah. [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1581.1000000000001s)]
*  Well, you certainly didn't hate... [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1582.22s)]
*  You didn't hate each other by the end of the day. [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1583.42s)]
*  Yeah, or if you thought the guy was a bully, you got to kind of figure it out with him or... [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1585.3400000000001s)]
*  And you work out why he was being a bully or lashing out. [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1589.1000000000001s)]
*  Right. [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1591.66s)]
*  What was going on. [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1592.22s)]
*  I thought it was just kind of an interesting program, man. [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1592.94s)]
*  Yeah, I don't have a wife, but I'm probably going to get one one of these days. [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1596.7s)]
*  And so, do you think it's hard? [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1599.74s)]
*  Because you're like the love... [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1604.22s)]
*  Like, a lot of your songs have like a lot of love in them, you know? [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1605.5s)]
*  And so, is it hard to still be like... [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1609.74s)]
*  Does your wife ever feel like, oh, you write all the good songs for the whole world? [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1614.46s)]
*  No, I think, you know, we went to... [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1619.18s)]
*  We went to high school together, so we've known each other 22 years now. [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1621.26s)]
*  And all of our mates are the same friends. [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1625.34s)]
*  So, we're like... [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1629.02s)]
*  We have like a little Suffolk cohort. [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1629.98s)]
*  And it's... [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1632.3799999999999s)]
*  She's very comfortable with... [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1634.86s)]
*  She's known me through everything. [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1636.46s)]
*  So, she's not like... [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1638.3s)]
*  There's not really any self-consciousness that comes through it, I guess. [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1639.42s)]
*  And we are... [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1643.34s)]
*  I mean, we're with each other. [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1645.66s)]
*  I'm going to see her after this to have a little break. [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1647.18s)]
*  But like... [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1651.34s)]
*  Yeah, we're with each other all the time. [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1652.86s)]
*  So, we talk a lot. [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1654.06s)]
*  I find that lots of little small uncomfortable conversations save arguments. [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1655.34s)]
*  So, you just like... [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1662.94s)]
*  If anything ever comes up, and we'll just sort of nip it in the bud there [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1663.82s)]
*  rather than let like resentment build. [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1666.3799999999999s)]
*  LH- Yeah, I struggle with that sometimes, man. [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1668.06s)]
*  Yeah, I'll just... [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1670.54s)]
*  I want to try and... [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1671.18s)]
*  Yeah, I don't know. [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1672.62s)]
*  Sometimes I can feel like right now you should probably say this. [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1673.66s)]
*  That way everything will be smooth. [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1676.3799999999999s)]
*  And there's a part of me that's like... [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1677.8999999999999s)]
*  LH- I was like that too. [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1679.1s)]
*  And then you just have to be like... [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1679.5s)]
*  And just say it. [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1681.5s)]
*  And then it's actually fine. [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1682.3s)]
*  I kind of do that with like everyone. [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1684.1399999999999s)]
*  I'm just trying to be like as honest as possible at all points. [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1685.82s)]
*  And then there's not really... [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1689.4199999999998s)]
*  You kind of see it as like bricks in a backpack. [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1690.7s)]
*  Like you've got loads of bricks in your backpack. [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1694.62s)]
*  And if you can take a brick out quickly, it just lightens the load. [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1696.78s)]
*  So, it's just getting the bricks out. [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1700.62s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1702.3s)]
*  You know? [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1702.94s)]
*  Yeah, gosh. [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1703.5s)]
*  I wonder how many relationships for years husbands and wives just sit on their words. [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1704.14s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1708.86s)]
*  LH- Yeah, I think a lot. [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1709.58s)]
*  And just go through every... [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1710.06s)]
*  And just sitting on a... [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1711.9s)]
*  For a sentence. [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1713.5s)]
*  LH- And then suddenly they're running at you with a meat cleaver. [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1714.46s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1717.18s)]
*  And just serving the last sausage rather than the dark hallway. [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1719.42s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1723.26s)]
*  Like a good man over there in Leeds or wherever. [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1723.82s)]
*  What's the most dangerous place to be around here? [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1727.66s)]
*  LH- Here? [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1730.7s)]
*  I'd say every area of London has a... [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1732.0800000000002s)]
*  Literally every area is sketchy. [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1736.0s)]
*  Like I think that you cannot be anywhere... [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1738.56s)]
*  I love that. [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1741.52s)]
*  Yeah, it's not like a segregated city. [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1744.24s)]
*  There's like... [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1747.1200000000001s)]
*  It's very... [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1747.8400000000001s)]
*  Everybody's scared. [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1748.56s)]
*  I mean, the nice areas are sketchy, the bad areas are sketchy, [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1750.88s)]
*  but you just have to not do stupid shit. [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1754.24s)]
*  Like if you wander around with, I don't know, [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1757.2s)]
*  like a Louis Vuitton duffel bag and a 200 grand watch, [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1763.2s)]
*  you are going to get robbed. [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1767.44s)]
*  But just don't do that. [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1770.0s)]
*  Yeah, don't do it. [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1771.28s)]
*  Yeah, I think... [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1772.8s)]
*  And y'all's robberies all have clues and stuff. [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1774.16s)]
*  That's what I like about London. [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1776.32s)]
*  Clues? [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1777.92s)]
*  Or like if there's something that happens, [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1778.88s)]
*  it's like, oh, he has a clue, you know? [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1780.96s)]
*  And the detectives or whatever, [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1783.2s)]
*  then they're hot on your trail. [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1786.0s)]
*  That's what I love. [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1787.44s)]
*  That's one of like the, I think the things that... [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1788.4s)]
*  Like you guys... [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1790.32s)]
*  I love that everything that you think about England [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1791.04s)]
*  is based on movies and like... [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1793.36s)]
*  Because it's the way that I used to view America as well. [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1795.12s)]
*  I remember going, I was... [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1797.36s)]
*  My wife went to Duke and we went back to Duke. [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1799.52s)]
*  And my mother went to Duke. [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1801.68s)]
*  Oh, good university. [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1802.8s)]
*  But I remember we were in town for something [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1805.04s)]
*  and we were driving past the frat houses [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1807.44s)]
*  and I was like, I've never been to a frat party. [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1809.28s)]
*  We just knock on the door of one of them [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1812.0s)]
*  and they'll be having a frat party like the movies. [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1814.24s)]
*  And like, Terry was like, yeah, I guess so. [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1817.2s)]
*  They're a bit... [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1819.2s)]
*  It's not like that vibe. [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1819.68s)]
*  And we went up, I knocked on the door. [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1821.44s)]
*  One of them opened the door and was like, [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1823.1200000000001s)]
*  why are you knocking on our door? [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1824.32s)]
*  And then we went in and it was just like three dudes [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1825.84s)]
*  and one guy who had his face super glued to the floor. [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1828.72s)]
*  And it was like not the vibe. [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1830.96s)]
*  And I was like, this isn't like the movies at all. [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1832.72s)]
*  He was just literally like this, face super glued down [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1836.64s)]
*  and they were just like, yeah, we don't really know. [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1838.56s)]
*  That's the general. [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1839.76s)]
*  Well, it's hard to get that guy up, I bet. [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1841.72s)]
*  And then, yeah, there was this in there manufacturing [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1843.8s)]
*  rehypenols or something like that, a GHB or whatever. [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1846.44s)]
*  A lot of homemade GHB in those areas. [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1849.72s)]
*  But yeah, it's not like the movies. [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1851.72s)]
*  Yeah, it's not. [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1854.6s)]
*  Yeah, nothing's kind of ever like... [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1855.48s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1856.84s)]
*  Like even today, we pulled up in a knotting hill [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1857.64s)]
*  and I was like, we're going to be in love or whatever. [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1859.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1863.32s)]
*  You know, because... [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1863.56s)]
*  Knotting hill is quite... [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1864.12s)]
*  This is quite like, if you're talking about like nice areas. [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1865.32s)]
*  Yeah, it just seemed romantic, you know? [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1868.28s)]
*  Like you'd meet like, you know, Paddington Bear [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1869.96s)]
*  is having a coffee with a woman or something over there, you know? [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1872.92s)]
*  Like... [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1876.2s)]
*  Bestiality. [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1876.3600000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1877.24s)]
*  Caffeine-fueled bestiality, dude. [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1879.64s)]
*  That's our new... [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1882.28s)]
*  Have you ever... [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1883.56s)]
*  Have I ever... [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1885.0s)]
*  Considered a collab with Paddington Bear? [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1888.3600000000001s)]
*  Do you know what? [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1893.08s)]
*  I would love to do a kids movie. [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1893.64s)]
*  Now that I have children, I'd love to do some form of animated something with music. [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1897.8000000000002s)]
*  I don't know if it's Paddington Bear or... [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1902.44s)]
*  Yeah, something. [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1905.5600000000002s)]
*  Because he's a famous British bear, isn't he? [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1906.6000000000001s)]
*  Very... [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1909.0s)]
*  Well, he's actually from... [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1909.3200000000002s)]
*  Where's Paddington Bear from? [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1910.76s)]
*  Peru, yeah. [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1912.3600000000001s)]
*  He's from... [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1912.92s)]
*  Well, but in the book, he's from Peru. [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1913.88s)]
*  He travels over to England. [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1916.76s)]
*  He's obsessed with... [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1918.2s)]
*  Is it jam sandwiches or peanut butter sandwich? [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1919.0800000000002s)]
*  Jam. [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1920.8400000000001s)]
*  And was he allowed to stay after Brexit or was he... [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1921.16s)]
*  Well, this is... [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1923.64s)]
*  So I have an Irish passport and you can only spend 90 days in Europe if you're English. [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1925.0s)]
*  So I was like, I have the Irish passport. [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1932.04s)]
*  I can tour more in Europe, but like none of my crew can spend more than 90 days there. [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1934.92s)]
*  And it used to be... [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1940.52s)]
*  Brexit, I think everyone has agreed that Brexit didn't work. [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1942.44s)]
*  And I think there will be a time where we will try and backtrack it a little bit [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1946.6s)]
*  and get back into Europe. [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1951.16s)]
*  But yeah, it was such a divisive thing at the time. [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1952.2s)]
*  Oh, it was? [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1957.56s)]
*  Yeah, it was like 50% of the country thought we should leave, [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1958.3600000000001s)]
*  50% of the country thought we should stay. [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1960.3600000000001s)]
*  There's a very, very, very small margin that we left. [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1962.3600000000001s)]
*  And I feel like the people that voted leave now were like actually wasn't the best idea. [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1966.44s)]
*  Maybe we should have stayed. [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1972.8400000000001s)]
*  That's how we're feeling, I think, after the Mayflower and everything. [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1974.1200000000001s)]
*  I think we might build another Mayflower. [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1976.76s)]
*  What is the Mayflower? [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1979.88s)]
*  The ship that we left on a long time ago. [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1980.92s)]
*  Right. [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1982.92s)]
*  And when you say we... [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1983.64s)]
*  A lot of people. [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1986.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1987.24s)]
*  I think a lot of people are going to be coming back. [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1988.28s)]
*  Yeah, I really do. [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1990.1200000000001s)]
*  Like we might build a Juneflower, Julyflower. [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1991.24s)]
*  I don't know, we're going to build one month, we're going to build a big boat, [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1994.6000000000001s)]
*  and I think we're coming back. [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1997.24s)]
*  Cool. [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1998.3600000000001s)]
*  I just don't think it's panned out as well as we expected over there. [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=1998.92s)]
*  It just gotten kind of... [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=2001.88s)]
*  Like a lot of the tradition, I think, is disappearing in America. [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=2003.16s)]
*  And maybe that's good. [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=2005.96s)]
*  Like sometimes you just don't... [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=2007.0s)]
*  I think that's the scary thing about when tradition goes away. [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=2008.2s)]
*  Because I see America as like lots and lots and lots of traditions and cultures. [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=2012.28s)]
*  What is the one central tradition that Americans can agree on? [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=2017.24s)]
*  That's a good point. [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=2022.68s)]
*  I think, or maybe we're just in a phase where there isn't really that, right? [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=2023.32s)]
*  And so that feels like scary. [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=2027.0800000000002s)]
*  You'll still celebrate July 4th and stuff like that. [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=2030.44s)]
*  That's like everyone will celebrate that, right? [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=2032.68s)]
*  Mm-hmm. [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=2034.8400000000001s)]
*  Some people now are seeing it as it's like a bad thing, you know? [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=2035.96s)]
*  But then it's not like we... [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=2040.04s)]
*  It's like... [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=2041.16s)]
*  I turned up to my first July 4th in a red coat. [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=2042.2s)]
*  Did you? [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=2045.0800000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=2045.5600000000002s)]
*  Let's go, dude. [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=2045.88s)]
*  And a flag, because I was like... [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=2047.16s)]
*  And the UK flag. [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=2049.48s)]
*  We're coming back. [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=2050.44s)]
*  No, no. [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=2051.0s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=2051.64s)]
*  Captain Jack, what is it? [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=2052.52s)]
*  Union Jack. [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=2053.64s)]
*  Union Jack. [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=2054.6800000000003s)]
*  The flags are weird over here as well, [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=2055.88s)]
*  because I don't think you can fly flags unless the football's on. [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=2057.2400000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=2061.8s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=2062.7599999999998s)]
*  If somebody's flying without the football, like, oh, that guy's... [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=2063.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=2065.96s)]
*  He's not doing as well. [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=2067.0s)]
*  He's Scottish. [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=2068.12s)]
*  And no offense if anybody's Scottish, dude. [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=2070.68s)]
*  A lot of people are saying it's not even real. [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=2073.16s)]
*  It's just a glitch on the map. [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=2074.8399999999997s)]
*  But that is... [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=2079.08s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=2081.96s)]

*  You know, I would guess, yeah. [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=2267.4s)]
*  I would just, I would definitely, oh yeah. [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=2269.16s)]
*  I will even, I remember even when I quit doing drugs, [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=2274.16s)]
*  I would still, if my buddy of mine was doing a line [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=2277.0s)]
*  of cocaine, which I don't recommend to anyone, [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=2279.4s)]

*  Like that's how close I still wanted to be to the action. [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=2287.4s)]

*  Yeah. [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=2293.84s)]
*  Yeah, it's also like, that's quite like, [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=2294.76s)]
*  I felt if someone grabbed the back of my neck, [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=2296.52s)]
*  I'd be like, what is about to happen? [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=2298.04s)]

*  I agree. [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=2306.92s)]
*  Okay. [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=2307.76s)]

*  It's a really gentle caress. [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=2309.44s)]
*  That's even worse. [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=2310.28s)]

*  and you didn't, [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=2374.6s)]
*  cause touring and stuff takes a lot of time [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=2375.52s)]
*  and touring and working and it's like when you're- [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=2377.6s)]
*  I've never been to a water park in my life. [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=2380.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=2382.52s)]
*  And that's something that I'm like, [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=2383.36s)]
*  I'd love to do at some point, [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=2386.0s)]
*  but I've never been ever. [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=2387.16s)]
*  And is it because like a sunshine thing is like a- [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=2388.4s)]
*  No, it's, as I said, like I got, [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=2391.0s)]
*  I left school before school finished. [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=2395.04s)]
*  And no, it's not, that's not a, I just, I left. [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=2398.28s)]
*  I went to be a singer. [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=2401.48s)]
*  I became a singer. [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=2402.6000000000004s)]
*  Oh, all right. [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=2403.44s)]
*  And in that time I was working just flat out [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=2404.28s)]
*  to become a singer and then I became a singer. [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=2406.6800000000003s)]
*  And then because I, people knew who I was, [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=2408.8s)]
*  it sort of limited things that I could do. [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=2412.0s)]
*  But I never really did it in that I was so focused [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=2414.6000000000004s)]
*  on my career that, you know, [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=2417.0s)]
*  there were TV shows that were like massive cultural [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=2419.7200000000003s)]
*  phenomenons at the time in my age group. [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=2422.36s)]
*  I only discovered like five years ago, [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=2424.48s)]
*  or like I didn't watch any football. [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=2426.6000000000004s)]
*  I didn't pay attention to this. [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=2428.08s)]
*  It was just so I'm going to, I want to do this. [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=2429.24s)]
*  So yeah, there was some things that I missed out on [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=2433.04s)]
*  in that time, one of which being, [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=2435.84s)]
*  it's a silly thing, [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=2439.08s)]
*  but it's something that I would love to do at some point. [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=2440.16s)]
*  Oh, you should get a bus full of, [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=2442.48s)]
*  I don't want to say, [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=2447.7999999999997s)]
*  Booty fucks. [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=2448.64s)]
*  Ginger men or whatever, and take them to a water park. [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=2449.48s)]
*  I think it would be, and I don't know if that, [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=2452.88s)]
*  I hope that's not an offensive term. [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=2454.7599999999998s)]
*  It's not, or I think you should get a bus full of... [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=2455.92s)]
*  It's interesting though, isn't it? [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=2458.2000000000003s)]
*  The ginger thing, because it's like, [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=2459.2000000000003s)]
*  it is the last bastion of things that you can't, [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=2460.56s)]
*  no, not, no, no, it's things that you can make fun of. [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=2464.48s)]
*  Someone on a TV show picked up, [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=2467.8s)]
*  they put a picture of a ginger cat on, [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=2470.44s)]
*  and they were like, this cat kind of looks like you. [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=2471.92s)]
*  And in my head, I was like, [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=2473.48s)]
*  if there was someone fat on this couch, [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=2474.64s)]
*  and you got up a picture of a fat cat, [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=2476.32s)]
*  that would be really offensive. [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=2478.6800000000003s)]
*  So when does the line start? [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=2479.6s)]
*  It stops just right outside of ginger, I think. [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=2482.8s)]
*  I think so too. [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=2484.92s)]
*  We're the last. [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=2485.76s)]
*  Well, in America, it stops, [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=2486.6s)]
*  the only people you can still make fun of are like, [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=2487.84s)]
*  redneck white people. [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=2489.52s)]
*  And everybody else is kind of off limits. [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=2491.88s)]
*  So it's like, you know, but I support, [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=2493.6800000000003s)]
*  I've always supported people that are... [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=2497.08s)]
*  Really pale with red hair. [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=2500.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=2501.2000000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=2502.04s)]
*  Till they come out with an SPF milkshake. [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=2502.88s)]
*  I think you definitely, the amount of sort of fun [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=2505.0s)]
*  that's made out of you as a kid, [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=2510.4s)]
*  makes for a good personality. [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=2512.0s)]
*  I feel like I have more fun than the pretty kids [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=2514.12s)]
*  that I grew up with. [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=2516.64s)]
*  Oh yeah, dude. [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=2517.48s)]
*  My best friend was the good looking kid, dude. [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=2518.7999999999997s)]
*  Oh. [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=2522.04s)]
*  Caleb. [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=2522.88s)]
*  No, not him. [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=2523.72s)]
*  He's pretty good looking too, dude. [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=2524.68s)]
*  He also looks like a really hot woman in some countries. [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=2526.52s)]
*  Okay. [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=2531.12s)]
*  I'm not going to name them, but a lot of Slavic areas. [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=2531.96s)]
*  He's a nine, female nine, dude. [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=2536.16s)]
*  And that's only if he's partially shaved. [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=2540.68s)]
*  So, but no, my buddy Scott, when I was growing up, [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=2544.08s)]
*  that's whose wedding I was at. [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=2547.24s)]
*  He was like the handsomest guy, dude. [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=2548.2s)]
*  And he's just got no chat. [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=2550.3199999999997s)]
*  And he just, he, but no, he was great. [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=2551.92s)]
*  He was just, but yeah, I always had to be the other guy. [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=2554.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=2557.4s)]
*  You know, and... [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=2558.24s)]
*  You probably, you feel like you've aged [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=2559.92s)]
*  like a fine wine, right? [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=2561.64s)]
*  I've aged. [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=2563.36s)]
*  I've aged. [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=2564.72s)]
*  I've aged like a decent provolone, I think. [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=2567.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=2571.16s)]
*  I don't know if I'd say fine wine. [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=2572.0s)]
*  Yeah, maybe a... [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=2575.04s)]
*  Provolone age? [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=2575.92s)]
*  Provolone. [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=2577.4s)]
*  I'm sure it ages, huh? [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=2578.24s)]
*  Just get moldy, right? [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=2579.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=2580.3199999999997s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=2581.16s)]
*  You've got to get tested every now and then. [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=2582.4s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=2585.2799999999997s)]
*  Keep your pH balance decent. [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=2586.12s)]
*  But I was going to say, are there things you started to do [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=2589.16s)]
*  like in your career that you started, [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=2592.0s)]
*  like it was another like thing you wanted to start to learn, [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=2593.12s)]
*  like learn a language. [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=2595.7599999999998s)]
*  You know, like Joe Rogan told me one day, he's like, [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=2596.6s)]
*  when I'm done with doing this job, I want to paint. [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=2598.92s)]
*  And I never thought I would hear him say, I was like, huh? [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=2602.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=2604.64s)]
*  Howard Stern paints really, really well. [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=2605.48s)]
*  Howard Stern does like amazing watercolors. [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=2608.24s)]
*  Like you see them and you're like, holy shit. [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=2610.8799999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=2612.52s)]
*  Silence of the Lambs paints, dude. [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=2613.3599999999997s)]
*  What's his name? [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=2616.96s)]
*  Anthony Hopkins. [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=2617.68s)]
*  Anthony Hopkins, dude. [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=2618.7599999999998s)]
*  Bring him up. [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=2620.04s)]
*  Oh, wow. [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=2621.68s)]
*  He paints. [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=2623.2799999999997s)]
*  That's amazing. [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=2623.92s)]
*  Did the lambs stop painting? [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=2625.7599999999998s)]
*  I paint as well. [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=2628.8799999999997s)]
*  Oh, really? I didn't know that. [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=2630.24s)]
*  Actually, at the front of the pub, there's a painting that I did, [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=2631.28s)]
*  but it's less, it's more, [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=2634.0s)]
*  it's more I just go into a studio with canvases on the floor [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=2636.0800000000004s)]
*  and just splash loads of color. [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=2640.0s)]
*  And when it's done, it's done. [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=2642.52s)]
*  But that's more like I started doing that when I finished. [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=2643.88s)]
*  I did this tour that ended in 2019. [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=2647.1200000000003s)]
*  And when it finished, I was like, I don't want to do music for like a month, [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=2649.84s)]
*  but also I want to carry on being creative and do stuff. [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=2652.6400000000003s)]
*  So I started painting then. [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=2655.1600000000003s)]
*  I learned Italian as well. [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=2656.6400000000003s)]
*  That was like a thing. [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=2658.4s)]
*  I bought a place in Italy and no one speaks English there. [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=2659.6s)]
*  So I was like, I have to learn Italian. [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=2663.8399999999997s)]
*  But those are like the two things that if I wasn't doing music, [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=2665.68s)]
*  I'd like to put more time into. [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=2668.48s)]
*  And honestly, like, I love movies, discovering new things. [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=2671.12s)]
*  Like movies, like different artists, albums. [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=2677.68s)]
*  Will you listen to something or watch something [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=2681.2s)]
*  to sometimes put you in like a mood to like create your own music even? [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=2683.04s)]
*  No, my creative process is just basically like do it. [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=2687.36s)]
*  Like just get in and do it. [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=2692.08s)]
*  And if it's bad, forget about it and move on. [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=2694.0s)]
*  So I try to be creative every single day. [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=2697.2000000000003s)]
*  Write a song every single day or two songs every single day [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=2700.1600000000003s)]
*  and not worry about whether it's good or not. [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=2702.88s)]
*  Like not be like... [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=2705.1200000000003s)]
*  I feel like some people think that like writer's block is a thing [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=2707.76s)]
*  where you're like, oh, I can't write songs. [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=2711.76s)]
*  You can write songs, you just can't write good songs. [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=2714.1600000000003s)]
*  So just like keep writing. [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=2715.84s)]
*  Get the bad ones out. [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=2717.28s)]
*  Exactly, yeah. [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=2718.4s)]
*  So Shape of You was written on a day and we wrote four other songs that day [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=2719.04s)]
*  that no one's really heard and Shape of You came out of that. [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=2722.48s)]
*  And if I hadn't written the four bad songs, [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=2725.76s)]
*  I wouldn't have got the one good song. [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=2727.28s)]
*  So yeah, just a process of just constantly doing it. [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=2728.56s)]
*  But I don't think I've ever really watched... [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=2731.6800000000003s)]
*  The only movie that I've watched to create something [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=2733.2000000000003s)]
*  was I did a song for The Hobbit and they showed me the movie [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=2737.28s)]
*  and then they went, this is the point where the song comes in [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=2741.2000000000003s)]
*  and your song has to convey this and bring the audience out of the movie. [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=2744.16s)]
*  And it was a point where Smaug's going to the big town at the end [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=2747.8399999999997s)]
*  and he's going to destroy it and cover it in fire and flames and blah, blah, blah. [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=2751.7599999999998s)]
*  So they were like, we need this chaotic bit and then a calm bit [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=2756.08s)]
*  and you basically taking the audience out of the cinema. [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=2759.2s)]
*  So that was the first time I've been like inspired by a movie, I guess. [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=2761.68s)]
*  Wow, that's a pretty cool task, huh? [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=2765.04s)]
*  Yeah, really cool. [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=2767.04s)]
*  And also in that process, you're essentially working [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=2768.08s)]
*  in a creative medium that you don't really know anything about [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=2771.36s)]
*  and you're so excited. [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=2776.7200000000003s)]
*  I was so geeked out to be working with Peter and Fran [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=2777.84s)]
*  and then getting to do the press tour with all of the actors and stuff [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=2781.28s)]
*  and you're suddenly there in a world that you don't really belong in. [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=2783.84s)]
*  But it's like, the reason... [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=2786.7200000000003s)]
*  Musicians are obsessed with sports players [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=2789.6800000000003s)]
*  and the sports players are obsessed with musicians [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=2791.28s)]
*  and it's because each can do something that the other can't do. [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=2793.04s)]
*  But there's still like a level of dedication you have to do to get to that point. [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=2796.1600000000003s)]
*  I love being on the other side of the coin. [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=2800.1600000000003s)]
*  Went to one of the Celtics games the other day and being like... [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=2803.52s)]
*  Boston Celtics? [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=2806.08s)]
*  Oh yeah, you get in free over there, I'm sure, dude. [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=2807.6800000000003s)]
*  There's no way. [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=2810.0s)]
*  They're like, he made it. [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=2812.32s)]
*  No judgment, dude. [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=2816.08s)]
*  It's all good, man. [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=2817.44s)]
*  If I show up like at a remedial reading center, I fucking get in immediately. [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=2820.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=2826.6400000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=2827.7799999999997s)]
*  But my point is being on the... [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=2828.98s)]
*  Watching it. [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=2831.54s)]
*  And I've never really had an appreciation for basketball before [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=2832.8199999999997s)]
*  because I've never really like... [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=2835.8599999999997s)]
*  I've been to like a couple of games, but like something clicked on that game [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=2836.74s)]
*  and I was like, this is so exciting and they're so skilled and it's so fast. [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=2839.62s)]
*  And like, what I loved about it is in football, [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=2844.9s)]
*  if you're losing 5-0 with 10 minutes to go, you've lost. [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=2847.8599999999997s)]
*  And in basketball, you could be losing like by 20 or 30 points [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=2851.62s)]
*  with the last two minutes to go. [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=2854.8199999999997s)]
*  And it just could go bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, and then win. [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=2856.34s)]
*  It's like really exciting. [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=2858.5s)]
*  Who's your basketball team? [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=2861.0600000000004s)]
*  Basketball? [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=2861.94s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=2863.5400000000004s)]
*  I don't know, dude. [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=2864.9s)]
*  Actually, I like Caitlin Clark's team. [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=2866.26s)]
*  I started following her in college and I'm a... [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=2868.1800000000003s)]
*  I like, I'll watch her highlights and stuff, you know? [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=2870.82s)]
*  She plays for Indiana Fever now, but me and Caleb went to Iowa Hawkeyes game [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=2873.38s)]
*  where she broke the record, which was pretty cool, dude. [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=2877.7000000000003s)]
*  I like Iowa a lot. [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=2880.9s)]
*  We're pretty high. [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=2882.26s)]
*  I like Iowa too, man. [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=2882.9s)]
*  You know, in Iowa... [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=2884.9s)]
*  I played IndyCar in Iowa. [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=2886.1s)]
*  Really? [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=2887.94s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=2888.2599999999998s)]
*  I remember... [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=2888.5s)]
*  Did you race or no? [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=2888.74s)]
*  No, I was just playing the gig. [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=2889.94s)]
*  I waved the flag. [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=2891.06s)]
*  Not very well. [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=2892.18s)]
*  But I remember walking... [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=2894.1s)]
*  You bring the Union Jack to that and people will get a little teed, I think. [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=2894.98s)]
*  Someone there, as I was walking to stage, someone grabbed my arm [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=2899.54s)]
*  and looked at me dead in the eyes was like, [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=2902.9s)]
*  welcome to God's country, Ed. [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=2904.2599999999998s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=2907.94s)]
*  I loved it. [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=2908.98s)]
*  Oh yeah, that sounds like the ghost of high cholesterol [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=2910.1s)]
*  found you, dude, like in a Charles Dickens novel or something. [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=2913.2999999999997s)]
*  Damn, yeah, I'm trying to think. [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=2917.06s)]
*  Oh yeah, I'm trying to think of... [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=2918.8199999999997s)]
*  Yeah, have you ever gotten asked to go play for like a chic or anything over there [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=2921.14s)]
*  in like a castle or anything like that? [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=2924.66s)]
*  Where? [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=2927.7s)]
*  Like in the desert or anything? [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=2928.18s)]
*  No, probably. [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=2932.5s)]
*  Probably. [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=2934.2599999999998s)]
*  My... [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=2934.74s)]
*  Yeah, we get private show requests. [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=2936.8199999999997s)]
*  My thing is like I never want to feel owned. [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=2939.2999999999997s)]
*  I don't want someone to be like, you do this, you do this, because I paid you this. [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=2943.78s)]
*  So like if I'm ever going to do a private show, it's usually for like... [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=2947.3s)]
*  It's usually for like a company's end of year party or something. [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=2952.1s)]
*  And they're just like, just do a show. [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=2955.7s)]
*  Right. [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=2957.14s)]
*  You turn up and you play the show. [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=2957.38s)]
*  But I would feel weird if someone was like, you come and you sing this song [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=2958.98s)]
*  at the time that we tell you to sing it and you just... [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=2963.86s)]
*  I like touring, I like playing shows, so I do my shows. [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=2966.34s)]
*  And if I'm ever going to do a private gig, it's usually someone just saying, [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=2970.1s)]
*  can you just do the show that you do there but in a smaller place, [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=2972.9s)]
*  is what I would prefer to do. [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=2975.7s)]
*  Right, yeah. [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=2977.22s)]
*  Not like, yeah, come perform it in this wet cage at 640 or whatever. [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=2977.7s)]
*  Yeah, come and play a cover of this song that isn't even your song [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=2981.14s)]
*  to my daughter while she eats breakfast. [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=2986.58s)]
*  Like I'm not... [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=2989.62s)]
*  That ain't me. [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=2990.3399999999997s)]
*  Yeah, that's like kind of... [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=2991.54s)]
*  That's almost a very expensive ASMR, it sounds like as well. [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=2992.58s)]
*  But one time I got offered to go to this place in the Middle East somewhere [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=2996.3399999999997s)]
*  and it was like Ludo La Harta or somewhere, a place you hadn't even heard of, right? [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=3001.62s)]
*  So it could have just been in New Jersey or whatever. [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=3007.7s)]
*  But they were... [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=3010.02s)]
*  And it was like there was like a chic and you had to be behind a big plexiglass area. [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=3011.46s)]
*  You would come in, perform there, he would be eating there with like 90 of his girlfriends [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=3018.2599999999998s)]
*  or whatever. [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=3022.4199999999996s)]
*  You would perform and then... [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=3024.18s)]
*  And then you lie down and he shits on your chest. [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=3026.3399999999997s)]
*  There may have been an afters. [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=3030.02s)]
*  I didn't know, but I didn't read the whole pamphlet either, [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=3033.9399999999996s)]
*  but I do know that they were allowed to ask a few questions at the end. [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=3036.74s)]
*  And then you got to eat, but you had to stay in this area by yourself [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=3041.3799999999997s)]
*  through the plexiglass while they all had... [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=3044.8999999999996s)]
*  And you went, you did it. [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=3046.3399999999997s)]
*  While they had a great time, I didn't go. [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=3047.14s)]
*  And what was the fee for that? [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=3048.66s)]
*  The fee was probably $1500. [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=3050.82s)]
*  Do you have a private fee? [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=3054.82s)]
*  Like if someone goes, come play at Bar Mitzvah. [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=3056.1000000000004s)]
*  You have a fee. [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=3059.46s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=3060.1000000000004s)]
*  Now I would have a fee for sure because it's like, [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=3060.5s)]
*  what else do you want to do with your time? [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=3062.82s)]
*  Are you already relaxing? [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=3064.5800000000004s)]
*  Are you going to be missing something that's important? [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=3065.6200000000003s)]
*  Because now I have to set up time where I'm relaxing. [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=3067.5400000000004s)]
*  It's like I had to set up time to watch Baby Reindeer. [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=3071.1400000000003s)]

*  I hope they do it again. [[00:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=3077.46s)]
*  You know, I'd hate to... [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=3080.6600000000003s)]
*  I hate for them not to go through it all again, [[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=3081.7000000000003s)]
*  especially the guy kind of went through a lot. [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=3083.46s)]
*  As in do like a sequel show? [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=3084.82s)]
*  Yeah, or just both of them. [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=3086.5s)]
*  Just figure it out. [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=3087.94s)]

*  and it's like from the perspective... [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=3090.6600000000003s)]
*  Isn't that like it's the court case or something like that? [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=3092.0200000000004s)]

*  You almost start to fall in love with the lady. [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=3107.78s)]
*  Mm. [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=3111.1400000000003s)]
*  You didn't think? [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=3111.7000000000003s)]
*  No. [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=3112.6600000000003s)]
*  Piers. [[00:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=3113.86s)]
*  The way she was talking to Piers Morgan. [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=3114.42s)]
*  Have you done the Piers Morgan show? [[00:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=3117.7000000000003s)]

*  I don't know enough about... [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=3124.26s)]
*  It's hard for me to know what British people are up to, you know? [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=3125.7000000000003s)]
*  Like some cultures you can kind of get a read on them [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=3129.2200000000003s)]
*  and you're like what's going on? [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=3131.46s)]
*  I think Britain's very direct. [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=3133.0600000000004s)]
*  I think he'd ask you a lot of very direct questions. [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=3134.42s)]
*  And you wouldn't, but you don't strike me as the sort of person [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=3136.5s)]
*  that like needs to navigate direct questions. [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=3139.3s)]
*  So I think you'd be fine. [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=3143.2200000000003s)]
*  I did his show like 2013 when he was on CNN and I found it a great interview. [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=3144.5s)]
*  Yeah? [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=3151.0600000000004s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=3151.38s)]
*  You enjoyed it? [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=3151.7000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, he's like a research guy and he doesn't like... [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=3152.6600000000003s)]
*  He just asks you the questions that I feel like people would want to hear, I think. [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=3156.26s)]
*  Yeah, 100% man. [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=3160.9s)]
*  Do you feel like you'll make different music [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=3163.38s)]
*  since you have like a family and stuff now? [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=3165.6200000000003s)]
*  Does that start to like... [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=3167.2200000000003s)]
*  I definitely did, yeah. [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=3168.5s)]
*  I guess it's kind of a silly question, but it's like... [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=3169.46s)]
*  I made an album that my fans weren't like over the moon about [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=3171.06s)]
*  because I feel like I was in quite a happy point of my life. [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=3174.18s)]
*  And so the album didn't have much tension. [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=3177.7s)]
*  It was just I made a record. [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=3180.82s)]
*  But yeah, I feel like my... [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=3184.58s)]
*  You know, just because I'm married with kids doesn't mean that like [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=3186.42s)]
*  you don't have tension in your life. [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=3189.14s)]
*  I feel like even more so there's been things in my life [[00:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=3190.5s)]
*  that have happened over the past two years. [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=3192.98s)]
*  So I think the music that I'm making at the moment is [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=3194.5s)]
*  more like the music I was making in my early 20s [[00:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=3197.54s)]
*  when there was a lot of tension going on in my life. [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=3200.1s)]
*  But you definitely go through periods of time, don't you? [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=3203.06s)]
*  I'm sure you go through periods of time where you're like, [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=3204.74s)]
*  things are good, yeah, I feel quite settled, quite happy. [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=3206.74s)]
*  And then suddenly a bombshell happens and then you have to... [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=3209.06s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=3211.7799999999997s)]
*  So I feel like that's, for me, always creating music. [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=3212.5s)]
*  I can see like back on my albums as like a lineage of like, [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=3216.02s)]
*  this is where I was at this point, this is where I was at this point. [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=3219.2999999999997s)]
*  And I feel like if all of the albums sounded the same, it'd be boring. [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=3221.2999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, you have to evolve in some sort. [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=3224.02s)]
*  And it's good to have like, this is the album when I was like... [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=3225.94s)]
*  The album when I made an album in COVID, quite settled, quite happy. [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=3228.5s)]
*  We had our first child and yeah, I listen to that now and it's not... [[00:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=3232.5s)]
*  There's no like heartbreak songs on it or sad songs. [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=3236.34s)]
*  Well, it's just kind of it is what it is. [[00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=3239.06s)]
*  Yeah, because a lot of times it's like rip my fucking heart out, Eddie. [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=3241.62s)]
*  Yeah. I think I'm getting back on this one. [[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=3244.7400000000002s)]
*  I think... [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=3248.1s)]
*  That's what we want, man. [[00:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=3249.62s)]
*  But this is what you're saying about taking time off. [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=3250.98s)]
*  You have to take time off to actually live life. [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=3253.14s)]
*  Like if I'm on the road, I think this is another thing why people who get successful early [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=3254.98s)]
*  have their age freeze, because when I'm on the road, life does just pause. [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=3260.82s)]
*  Because you like today, you wake up, get on a plane, you fly here, [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=3264.42s)]
*  we're doing an interview, you might go out for dinner tonight. [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=3267.22s)]
*  There's no like actual real life interaction in your actual personal life being lived [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=3269.06s)]
*  because you're constantly working. [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=3275.62s)]
*  So you'll go back, I always found this, you'll go back home [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=3277.22s)]
*  and you'll press play on your life again and then you'll be like, [[00:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=3279.78s)]
*  holy fuck, so much has happened. [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=3282.18s)]
*  How do I keep up with this? [[00:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=3283.94s)]
*  Your friend who was dating this person is now not dating this person. [[00:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=3285.7799999999997s)]
*  You've missed that whole thing. [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=3288.58s)]
*  Your dad might be going through something. [[00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=3289.54s)]
*  You've missed that whole thing. [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=3290.8199999999997s)]
*  Like your brother's doing this. [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=3291.7799999999997s)]
*  It is weird. [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=3293.22s)]
*  That's a really great way to say it too. [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=3293.86s)]
*  Yeah, it's like... [[00:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=3295.2999999999997s)]
*  You just put it on pause and you go and do your thing and you come back [[00:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=3295.86s)]
*  and you press play on you, but it's like the whole world has been pressing play. [[00:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=3298.02s)]
*  And I think everybody can even relate to that too. [[00:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=3303.22s)]
*  I mean, going and touring and that kind of thing is a little separate, [[00:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=3305.7799999999997s)]
*  different because you kind of get taken out of your life almost. [[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=3308.9s)]
*  And then you just drop right back into your life. [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=3312.58s)]
*  And you're like, well, like, yeah, for me, it's like, well, was I dating somebody? [[00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=3314.58s)]
*  Oh shit, I never responded. [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=3318.2599999999998s)]
*  My sister invited me to this and that thing's over now. [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=3319.7s)]
*  And it's like, yeah, just like... [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=3322.3399999999997s)]
*  And then you look at old emails or sometimes like your thought processes [[00:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=3324.66s)]
*  will have changed and things you wanted to do and move forward with. [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=3328.02s)]
*  Totally. [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=3330.66s)]
*  Three months ago, you're like, ah, that's not the thing I need now. [[00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=3331.14s)]
*  Some things you're glad you didn't move forward with. [[00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=3334.2599999999998s)]

*  Yeah, exactly. [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=3338.02s)]
*  But some of that's kind of fascinating. [[00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=3339.14s)]
*  When I started podcasting, an online store was one of the furthest things [[00:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=3341.2999999999997s)]
*  from my imagination, having a place to sell things or sell t-shirts or this or that. [[00:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=3345.22s)]
*  And it started off, my buddy Ken was making our t-shirts in his basement [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=3350.18s)]
*  and things started to grow. [[00:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=3356.66s)]

*  And that's where Shopify showed up to help. [[00:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=3363.8599999999997s)]

*  I get scared to like see people in person because I feel like I'm not going to be able to [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=3493.38s)]

*  Do you think? [[00:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=3505.54s)]

*  cultural significance of who you are and what people perceive you to be. [[00:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=3510.7400000000002s)]
*  I definitely get that because you might be having an off day and people are like, [[00:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=3515.78s)]
*  hey, be the guy. [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=3518.98s)]

*  Like, I just want to like chill out. [[00:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=3521.38s)]
*  So yeah, definitely. [[00:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=3523.86s)]
*  But I think that my way of moving through life is always just be like, [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=3524.98s)]
*  always be completely honest of what it is at that point. [[00:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=3530.5s)]
*  So I remember being like, I will usually say yes to photographs. [[00:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=3533.78s)]
*  If I'm with my kids, I'm like, look, I'm with my kids. [[00:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=3537.46s)]
*  I'm trying to be a dad. [[00:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=3539.3s)]
*  But like sometimes if I'm feeling off, like my aunt died and I was at a train station [[00:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=3540.42s)]
*  and someone was like being really, you know, like a fan and like, come on. [[00:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=3545.0600000000004s)]
*  I was like, my aunt just died. [[00:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=3549.3s)]
*  Please, I just need a fucking moment. [[00:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=3551.6200000000003s)]

*  Like no one's, but if I'd just been like, fuck off, like, yeah, suddenly it's a thing. [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=3556.1800000000003s)]
*  But I think honesty throughout, this is what I was saying earlier about just like saying [[00:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=3559.94s)]
*  truthful things when they come into your brain. [[00:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=3564.26s)]
*  It's people get people appreciate honesty. [[00:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=3566.5s)]
*  I think. [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=3570.02s)]
*  Yeah, that's a good point. [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=3570.5s)]
*  And maybe they can feel it too. [[00:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=3572.02s)]
*  That's always the thing. [[00:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=3573.6200000000003s)]
*  I think that gets weird as you get older. [[00:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=3574.34s)]
*  If you even think about telling a lie, sometimes even a small lie, I'm like, [[00:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=3576.1800000000003s)]
*  it just feels like it's the lies. [[00:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=3579.6200000000003s)]
*  If you tell lots of small lies, then you then have to keep up on like, [[00:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=3582.5s)]
*  who did I say this to and who did I do this? [[00:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=3586.5s)]
*  So that's if you go through life and you're, who did I tell? [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=3588.5800000000004s)]
*  I was a mime. [[00:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=3590.98s)]
*  And then you're fucking everybody you meet. [[00:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=3591.94s)]
*  You're like, now that's it. [[00:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=3595.14s)]
*  That should be something that in your spare time, when you're training to do something, [[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=3596.66s)]
*  Joe's going to be an artist. [[01:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=3601.3s)]
*  You should train to be a mime. [[01:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=3602.66s)]
*  I would love to see you be a mime. [[01:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=3604.02s)]
*  Fully painted, just be fucking great. [[01:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=3606.58s)]
*  And they're always stuck in the smallest apartment. [[01:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=3609.38s)]
*  It's like, first of all, get a better job, you know, and fucking get out of that rat trap. [[01:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=3611.46s)]
*  That's what I always think about those guys. [[01:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=3617.54s)]
*  But that's a lost art, isn't it? [[01:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=3619.46s)]
*  Miming. [[01:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=3621.54s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=3622.42s)]
*  What else is the lost art? [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=3622.82s)]
*  Dude, there used to be a lot of mimes, Ed. [[01:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=3624.1s)]
*  Look, pull that up, dude. [[01:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=3628.98s)]
*  How many mimes were there probably in 2010 or 2005? [[01:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=3630.66s)]
*  Let's fucking go back since we have access to all this online. [[01:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=3635.78s)]
*  And mimes were some of the first mixed people as well. [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=3643.2200000000003s)]
*  Nobody wanted to kind of see it like that. [[01:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=3645.78s)]
*  And much others, much records of mimes. [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=3648.42s)]
*  Yeah, it's quite a niche subject, Theo. [[01:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=3650.5s)]
*  It's quite like... [[01:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=3652.34s)]
*  This is another thing. [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=3654.5s)]
*  When you are trained to be a mime, you got to make the mime archives, [[01:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=3655.46s)]
*  because then we can rely on you to... [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=3658.9s)]
*  When we Google, we're like, Theo's got us. [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=3662.1000000000004s)]
*  It's kind of perfect, dude. [[01:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=3668.1000000000004s)]
*  Niche. [[01:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=3669.2200000000003s)]
*  Yeah, wild ass. [[01:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=3669.6200000000003s)]
*  First of all, I'll say this about mimes. [[01:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=3671.54s)]
*  They're lazy, dude. [[01:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=3673.3s)]
*  I'll straight up say that right now, bro. [[01:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=3675.7s)]
*  And mimes, well, magicians or comedians are arch-nemesis, right? [[01:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=3678.9799999999996s)]
*  And that's been since like the beginning of time, dude. [[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=3682.58s)]
*  But I'll say this also, mimes can suck it. [[01:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=3685.7799999999997s)]
*  I'll go ahead and say that right now, bro. [[01:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=3689.3799999999997s)]
*  If you're a mime, dude, bring it, bro. [[01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=3692.4199999999996s)]
*  I think the day that you learn to be a mime, [[01:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=3696.9799999999996s)]
*  you'll actually learn a bit of appreciation for it. [[01:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=3699.14s)]
*  You'll be like, actually, this is way harder than I thought. [[01:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=3701.06s)]
*  And then you'll be making... [[01:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=3703.46s)]
*  You make the mime archive. [[01:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=3704.26s)]
*  That can be your side hustle. [[01:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=3707.2200000000003s)]
*  There should be. [[01:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=3708.66s)]
*  Who was the most famous mime? [[01:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=3709.2200000000003s)]
*  Oh, well, there was Charlie Chaplin, wasn't there? [[01:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=3710.5s)]
*  He's British. [[01:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=3713.06s)]
*  Marcel Marceau. [[01:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=3713.78s)]
*  Marcel Marceau? [[01:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=3714.7400000000002s)]
*  Was he British? [[01:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=3715.7s)]
*  I think he's French. [[01:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=3716.98s)]
*  Yeah, sure. [[01:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=3717.94s)]
*  I'm sure the Brits commandeered him. [[01:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=3719.3s)]
*  I'm sure they put a flag on his back at some point and said he was British. [[01:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=3723.86s)]
*  Bip the Clown, his name was. [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=3728.18s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[01:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=3730.66s)]
*  Who? Marcel Marceau? [[01:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=3731.46s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=3732.58s)]
*  Let me look a little bit about him. [[01:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=3733.94s)]
*  Marcel Marceau. [[01:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=3734.98s)]
*  Can you zoom in on that so I can read that there, brother? [[01:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=3735.7s)]
*  You go up to the top. [[01:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=3738.02s)]
*  Marcel Marceau, 22nd of March, he was born. [[01:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=3739.94s)]
*  Oh, he lived for a long time. [[01:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=3743.14s)]
*  2007 was a French mime artist actor, [[01:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=3745.94s)]
*  most famous for his stage persona, Bip the Clown. [[01:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=3748.02s)]
*  He referred to mime as the art of silence. [[01:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=3751.06s)]
*  You know, Mr. Bean was kind of like that, wasn't he? [[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=3754.42s)]
*  The other thing. [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=3756.42s)]
*  Mr. Bean, I think. [[01:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=3757.14s)]
*  It's fascinating. [[01:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=3759.06s)]
*  Well, it's fascinating because he, [[01:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=3760.02s)]
*  essentially every country understands Mr. Bean because there's no talking in it. [[01:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=3763.46s)]
*  I heard a rumor that he, when he did the show, [[01:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=3768.82s)]
*  it got them to agree to never show it in Italy because he liked holidaying in Italy. [[01:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=3772.5s)]
*  So that's the one place that I think they had the movie, but they didn't have the TV show. [[01:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=3776.74s)]
*  So it wasn't just constant so you wouldn't remember him as much. [[01:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=3781.22s)]
*  Did you ever get to meet him? [[01:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=3784.18s)]
*  There was a period, he was going to be in a music video for a bit. [[01:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=3786.5s)]
*  So we were actually in touch on email and it was, I think, the idea I had was very vague. [[01:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=3789.46s)]
*  And I think that was the problem. [[01:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=3798.66s)]
*  It wasn't like, this is what it is, this is when it's happening. [[01:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=3800.1s)]
*  And it was basically, I was kind of like, would you be interested in this? [[01:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=3802.7400000000002s)]
*  It might be this. [[01:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=3805.2200000000003s)]
*  And he was just like, it needs to be more solid than that. [[01:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=3805.86s)]
*  But we had a good exchange. [[01:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=3808.98s)]
*  The guy who I did, did you watch the movie yesterday? [[01:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=3810.9s)]
*  Yesterday? [[01:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=3813.7s)]
*  No. [[01:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=3815.3s)]
*  No. [[01:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=3815.7s)]
*  Anyway, the guy that made that movie, [[01:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=3816.18s)]
*  I'm in the movie, I play myself in the movie, [[01:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=3818.9s)]
*  but the guy that made that movie who wrote Notting Hill and Love Actually, [[01:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=3822.66s)]
*  and Four Weddings and the Funeral, he wrote Mr. Bean. [[01:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=3825.46s)]
*  So he's very close with... [[01:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=3828.58s)]
*  He wrote, so that was a... [[01:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=3829.78s)]
*  It wasn't just that guy made it up? [[01:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=3831.2200000000003s)]
*  No. [[01:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=3832.7400000000002s)]
*  Well, they did it together, I think. [[01:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=3833.2200000000003s)]
*  I think it was a stage show to begin with. [[01:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=3835.14s)]
*  So they did a show called Blackadder, which was, [[01:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=3836.9s)]
*  I think it's the best British comedy ever. [[01:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=3841.38s)]
*  It's basically... [[01:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=3842.98s)]
*  Black Hatter? [[01:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=3843.46s)]
*  Black Adder. [[01:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=3844.1s)]
*  And it's set in... [[01:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=3845.3s)]
*  It's the same characters, but set in different periods of time. [[01:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=3846.34s)]
*  So there would be somewhere there in the... [[01:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=3851.6200000000003s)]
*  Is it the Tudor time with... [[01:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=3854.9s)]
*  And then there's one in the Georgian time, there's one in World War... [[01:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=3856.7400000000002s)]
*  Black Adder. [[01:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=3859.54s)]
*  Oh, Mr. Bean's in it. [[01:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=3860.5800000000004s)]
*  Yeah, he's the main guy. [[01:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=3861.94s)]
*  So they did that first, and then they did Mr. Bean. [[01:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=3862.98s)]
*  I need to go back and watch this then. [[01:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=3866.82s)]
*  Black Adder is like an all-time classic. [[01:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=3868.42s)]
*  Really, really good. [[01:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=3871.3s)]
*  I watch... [[01:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=3872.7400000000002s)]
*  They do a Christmas Carol, and that's my like Christmas routine, [[01:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=3873.46s)]
*  as I always watch Black Adder Christmas Carol. [[01:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=3876.7400000000002s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[01:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=3878.5800000000004s)]
*  I watch Family Man. [[01:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=3879.7000000000003s)]
*  Have you seen that? [[01:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=3881.5400000000004s)]
*  With Nicolas Cage. [[01:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=3882.6600000000003s)]
*  Cool. [[01:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=3884.1000000000004s)]
*  You and the wife should watch it. [[01:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=3884.5800000000004s)]
*  I've got a massive cardboard cast out of Nicolas Cage in my house. [[01:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=3885.6200000000003s)]
*  Really? [[01:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=3888.5800000000004s)]
*  Oh, then you'll love it. [[01:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=3889.46s)]
*  You should put it up. [[01:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=3890.26s)]
*  I watched Mandy, and was just like, I'm sold. [[01:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=3890.98s)]
*  I gotta have some of that. [[01:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=3894.1000000000004s)]
*  Have you seen Mandy? [[01:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=3894.98s)]
*  It's fucking bonkers. [[01:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=3896.26s)]
*  Can you pull up the scene of him? [[01:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=3897.5400000000004s)]
*  Just type in Nicolas Cage, Mandy, toilet scene. [[01:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=3901.14s)]
*  Mr. Bean, what a great man. [[01:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=3906.3399999999997s)]
*  I wonder if his children are loud, and he's like, oh, this isn't what I wanted. [[01:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=3909.22s)]
*  Right. [[01:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=3912.8199999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=3914.1s)]
*  Wow. [[01:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=3931.14s)]
*  It's a great movie. [[01:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=3939.22s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=3940.42s)]
*  God, that alone. [[01:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=3941.22s)]
*  Even just that much of a moment of something that feels so real. [[01:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=3943.2999999999997s)]
*  That is our political system right now in America. [[01:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=3948.02s)]
*  Somebody said that you used to do like open, go to comedy mics. [[01:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=3952.42s)]
*  Did you ever? [[01:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=3956.18s)]
*  Not for me to do comedy, but I used to do it to... [[01:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=3957.22s)]
*  Actually, no, I did actually. [[01:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=3960.02s)]
*  I did... [[01:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=3961.14s)]
*  I used to play with this. [[01:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=3962.42s)]
*  They were an improvisational rap group called the Bander Man, [[01:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=3964.9s)]
*  and he was a comedian who rapped and made... [[01:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=3967.86s)]
*  He basically would be like, they had a song called What's in Your Pocket, [[01:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=3971.46s)]
*  and he would rap about what was in everyone's pockets and make it funny. [[01:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=3974.02s)]
*  So I played with them for a bit, but no, for me, it was more... [[01:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=3977.54s)]
*  The scene that I was a part of was very cliquey and very like the cool kids over here, [[01:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=3981.86s)]
*  and I was always part of the misfits. [[01:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=3986.66s)]
*  And you would go and play these gigs where everyone on the lineup would have an acoustic guitar, [[01:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=3988.5s)]
*  and they'd all be singing love songs, and I'd just be another one of them. [[01:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=3993.7s)]
*  Just not as good. [[01:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=3997.22s)]
*  I wasn't... [[01:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=3998.02s)]
*  I was 17, not 25. [[01:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=3998.98s)]
*  I had my songs were very rudimentary and not great. [[01:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4000.9s)]
*  And I found like this guy actually, my best mate Jamal, [[01:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4004.42s)]
*  ran a YouTube channel that was primarily rap, and he put me on that channel. [[01:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4008.74s)]
*  And then suddenly, there was a whole group of people that were like, [[01:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4013.86s)]
*  oh, we actually quite like this acoustic music. [[01:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4018.5s)]
*  So I would turn up at hip hop nights first and grime nights and soul nights, [[01:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4020.42s)]
*  and I would play and I would get a better reaction because it was just different. [[01:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4025.3s)]
*  It was something that would stand out, [[01:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4030.1800000000003s)]
*  whereas I did not stand out in the acoustic scene because it was just the same as everyone else. [[01:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4031.86s)]
*  Interesting. [[01:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4036.5s)]
*  And so, and then I started playing comedy nights, poetry nights. [[01:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4037.2200000000003s)]
*  I would turn up at different things. [[01:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4040.9s)]
*  I used to get roasted whilst the toughest gig I ever played. [[01:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4042.34s)]
*  It was an all black comedy night in central London called The Sunday Show, [[01:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4047.1400000000003s)]
*  and I was booked for this show. [[01:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4052.58s)]
*  And as I was setting up my guitar, the guy on stage was roasting me being like, [[01:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4053.86s)]
*  what the fuck is this white kid doing with this tiny guitar and blah, blah, blah. [[01:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4057.38s)]
*  And it was probably one of the best gigs of my life. [[01:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4061.1400000000003s)]
*  I got on stage, I instantly went into a rap tune. [[01:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4064.1800000000003s)]
*  I dropped this song and this song and this song. [[01:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4069.1400000000003s)]
*  And the reaction was better than anywhere, [[01:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4072.02s)]
*  because I think people were expecting me to fail, [[01:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4074.34s)]
*  and because I didn't, it was even better. [[01:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4076.82s)]
*  And those, I think that is what gave me my first bit of success, my first buzz. [[01:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4080.66s)]
*  The buzz within the kind of grime and rap community in the UK. [[01:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4086.42s)]
*  I think that was the first place I felt welcomed and accepted and celebrated. [[01:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4093.46s)]
*  And still is. [[01:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4099.139999999999s)]
*  I still feel more love and appreciation from... [[01:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4099.94s)]
*  The misfits? [[01:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4104.66s)]
*  No, from the grime and rap community in the UK. [[01:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4105.78s)]
*  Interesting. [[01:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4110.0199999999995s)]
*  Yeah, that's such a good idea, dude. [[01:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4111.3s)]
*  To take whatever your thing is and put it into, [[01:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4113.38s)]
*  go to the space that's different because then you're the different thing. [[01:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4117.3s)]
*  To be honest, it wasn't like an idea. [[01:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4121.0599999999995s)]
*  It wasn't like a light bulb moment where I was like, [[01:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4122.5s)]
*  but even when you say it though, it makes me think like that's... [[01:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4124.26s)]
*  It really is like there's no way you can't help but stand out, right? [[01:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4126.58s)]
*  So I think it has to happen organically, [[01:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4130.26s)]
*  because I feel like if Jamal hadn't put me on his channel, [[01:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4132.1s)]
*  and he put me on his channel, [[01:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4134.74s)]
*  the Sunday show booked me for their comedy night. [[01:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4135.94s)]
*  I did that, and then whilst at the comedy night, it's a very organic thing. [[01:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4137.78s)]
*  I think had I just turned up at the Sunday show, they'd be like... [[01:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4140.66s)]
*  Yeah, and maybe it wouldn't have gone the same way. [[01:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4145.22s)]
*  Right. That's a good point. [[01:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4146.9s)]
*  That's a good point. [[01:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4149.14s)]
*  But you have to change up the environment that you're in [[01:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4149.94s)]
*  and really challenge yourself. [[01:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4152.18s)]
*  That's pretty brave. [[01:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4153.3s)]
*  Yeah, I used to do some black shows, [[01:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4154.18s)]
*  like predominantly black shows in the States, dude. [[01:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4155.700000000001s)]
*  It was hard sometimes. [[01:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4157.62s)]
*  But when you killed it, you killed it, right? [[01:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4159.06s)]
*  Oh, you killed it, dude. [[01:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4160.820000000001s)]
*  Yeah, and people would stop me. [[01:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4163.860000000001s)]
*  Basically, but I bet it's either like you kill it or you bomb. [[01:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4164.900000000001s)]
*  Oh, there's no pain. [[01:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4168.5s)]
*  There's no like all right shows. [[01:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4169.860000000001s)]
*  And when you don't do good in front of a black audience as a white guy, [[01:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4171.22s)]
*  you feel the pain of hundreds of years. [[01:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4174.02s)]
*  You feel, I mean, my pain traveled all the way back to England in a boat. [[01:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4177.46s)]
*  And then got off and experienced more pain. [[01:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4187.3s)]
*  I was like, how much pain is inside of me? [[01:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4190.42s)]
*  Dude, I remember tears coming out of like the inside of my throat. [[01:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4193.94s)]
*  And I was like, I didn't know I had tear ducts in my... [[01:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4198.74s)]
*  Is that the worst that you bombed? [[01:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4201.46s)]
*  No, I fucking bombed pretty good over the years, Eddie. [[01:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4204.34s)]
*  I... [[01:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4207.62s)]
*  Yeah, I've had some bad ones. [[01:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4209.54s)]
*  I've had one where you came out. [[01:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4210.74s)]
*  It was like the battle of the bands at a school. [[01:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4213.14s)]
*  You had to come out between all the bands. [[01:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4215.46s)]
*  They didn't know. [[01:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4217.14s)]
*  They just thought you had to come out in the beginning. [[01:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4217.54s)]
*  They booed me off stage. [[01:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4219.06s)]
*  They don't have to go out six more times, dude. [[01:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4220.26s)]
*  And every time it just... [[01:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4223.78s)]
*  I feel like the... [[01:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4225.62s)]
*  It hurts a bit. [[01:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4226.5s)]
*  My eyebrows started to erupt, but one time, I was so shocked. [[01:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4227.62s)]
*  One of my fucking eyebrows fell out of my head. [[01:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4233.38s)]
*  From like... [[01:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4236.0199999999995s)]
*  It's called... [[01:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4238.9s)]
*  So what makes you appreciate it though? [[01:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4239.62s)]
*  I feel like anyone that has had success on stage has had to have been booed, [[01:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4240.9s)]
*  have things chucked at them, have moments where... [[01:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4246.42s)]
*  The shock, the trauma. [[01:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4249.3s)]
*  Some girls like something on your shirt and it was my fucking eyebrow, dude. [[01:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4250.34s)]
*  Like... [[01:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4254.18s)]
*  I was like, oh shit! [[01:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4256.82s)]
*  That's bad. [[01:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4258.74s)]
*  Yeah, so that kind of stuff to not be able to protect your tear ducts from the wind, [[01:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4260.5s)]
*  just because you had a bad set, dude. [[01:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4264.660000000001s)]
*  That's the kind of shit that people do that we do not need to be going through. [[01:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4266.42s)]
*  Yeah, I think sometimes the tough parts are like... [[01:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4272.26s)]
*  Sometimes I'll drift out of what I'm actually doing when I'm on stage. [[01:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4276.02s)]
*  I don't even know what it is. [[01:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4279.540000000001s)]
*  It's not like I'm daydreaming, but sometimes you'll just... [[01:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4280.26s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4283.3s)]
*  I'll kind of go on autopilot. [[01:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4283.860000000001s)]
*  Not because I want to. [[01:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4285.540000000001s)]
*  It just sort of happens. [[01:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4286.26s)]
*  And you have to drop back in, you know? [[01:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4287.22s)]
*  I do that sometimes. [[01:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4288.820000000001s)]
*  I did that. [[01:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4289.9400000000005s)]
*  I do it quite regularly on Perfect because it's just... [[01:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4290.660000000001s)]
*  I'm not having to think about what I'm doing with my feet. [[01:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4293.38s)]
*  And occasionally I just drop the second verse by accident, [[01:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4295.86s)]
*  and I just kind of come to and I'm like, oh, I've just not sung the second verse. [[01:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4298.34s)]
*  And the song is now like a minute and a half long. [[01:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4302.26s)]
*  But you do, you get in a... [[01:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4304.82s)]
*  There's certain things, I'm sure there's certain routines [[01:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4306.5s)]
*  that you just know so well that your mind just sort of wanders. [[01:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4308.5s)]
*  Yeah, and then how do you make them feel new and surprise yourself too, you know? [[01:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4312.18s)]
*  I think it's good every now and then to completely rip up the rule book [[01:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4316.66s)]
*  of what your performance is and just add them as well. [[01:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4319.54s)]
*  Yeah, that's a good point. [[01:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4322.58s)]
*  Do you... [[01:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4325.7s)]
*  Was being a father something that really kind of... [[01:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4327.7s)]
*  People talk about it all the time that it does so much for them. [[01:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4329.86s)]
*  Was it as much of a surprise for you? [[01:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4331.94s)]
*  It seemed like you had a lot of love in your life with your spouse. [[01:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4333.62s)]
*  So it wasn't like a... [[01:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4335.78s)]
*  Yeah, I think it's you just... [[01:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4337.7s)]
*  Selfishness ceases to exist, I think, because suddenly all your decisions are made based on... [[01:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4340.1s)]
*  I've got two daughters now and it's made based on what's best for them, you know? [[01:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4345.46s)]
*  Rather than what's best for me or what's best for my wife and that sort of simplifies life in a way, [[01:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4349.94s)]
*  because there's not as many questions. [[01:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4354.419999999999s)]
*  It's just like, well, what's right for these guys and then cool, done. [[01:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4356.5s)]
*  But yeah, I think, you know, I was a real party boy, like real... [[01:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4360.66s)]
*  Like I loved getting on it. [[01:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4365.0599999999995s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[01:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4367.0599999999995s)]
*  In all aspects. [[01:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4367.86s)]
*  Break out the gear. [[01:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4368.66s)]
*  I think probably like five years ago, me and you would have had a lot of fun together. [[01:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4371.139999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4374.5s)]
*  But I think having kids really, really dialed that down. [[01:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4375.379999999999s)]
*  I stopped drinking spirits. [[01:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4379.7s)]
*  I stopped like smoking and doing all these, you know, having wild nights. [[01:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4380.900000000001s)]
*  Like I don't think I've seen the sunrise since having kids. [[01:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4386.9800000000005s)]
*  But obviously you're sober when you see the sunrise with kids. [[01:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4390.9800000000005s)]
*  But I don't, you know, I go to bed at like midnight now. [[01:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4394.02s)]
*  Even if I'm having... [[01:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4396.1s)]
*  I drink wine and I drink like one or two beers. [[01:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4397.06s)]
*  And that's my advice, I guess. [[01:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4400.74s)]
*  Well, you have to be a proper parent. [[01:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4403.54s)]
*  You have to be a parent. [[01:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4404.9800000000005s)]
*  You have to be a leader or whatever. [[01:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4406.26s)]
*  Or you have to feed this when it wakes up. [[01:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4408.580000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4411.38s)]
*  You know? [[01:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4411.9400000000005s)]
*  Totally. [[01:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4412.26s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4412.740000000001s)]
*  I think... [[01:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4413.14s)]
*  It's like being in college a bit with like a roommate that can't cook or whatever. [[01:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4413.9400000000005s)]
*  And you're like... [[01:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4417.700000000001s)]
*  Do you know what I see it as? [[01:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4418.18s)]
*  It's your drunk mate at college that you need to get home from the bar [[01:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4419.620000000001s)]
*  and you're feeding them bread constantly and water. [[01:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4425.46s)]
*  It's kind of that. [[01:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4427.780000000001s)]
*  And they sort of fall asleep. [[01:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4428.820000000001s)]
*  It's kind of like that. [[01:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4431.3s)]
*  You sort of waking them up, like feeding them bread and stuff like that. [[01:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4432.660000000001s)]
*  And then they're sort of falling asleep in their chair. [[01:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4435.06s)]
*  It's kind of like that. [[01:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4436.820000000001s)]
*  One time I got in a taxi to leave a bar when I was in Charleston. [[01:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4437.86s)]
*  I used to live in Charleston. [[01:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4441.62s)]
*  And I forgot to... [[01:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4442.9s)]
*  I guess I was drunk. [[01:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4444.099999999999s)]
*  I just passed out. [[01:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4444.98s)]
*  The guy drove around, dude. [[01:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4445.62s)]
*  He drove like $190 worth. [[01:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4447.3s)]
*  I finally fucking wake up, dude. [[01:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4449.38s)]
*  He's just driving, bro. [[01:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4451.86s)]
*  And we're like still like about 12 minutes from my house. [[01:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4454.58s)]
*  So I get home, I owed him like $220, dude. [[01:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4456.82s)]
*  It took me like two weeks to pay that guy. [[01:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4459.3s)]
*  Jesus. [[01:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4461.22s)]
*  God, man. [[01:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4462.5s)]
*  Just things like that that I just don't miss about. [[01:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4463.7s)]
*  Sometimes just being wasted, dude, or hiding out in somebody's yard. [[01:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4466.42s)]
*  Do you find you have better conversations now? [[01:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4470.74s)]
*  Like if you're having a conversation with your mate and you're sober, it's more like... [[01:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4473.54s)]
*  Yeah, I find I don't waste time in bullshit. [[01:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4478.099999999999s)]
*  Like I'm not out at one... [[01:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4481.3s)]
*  You know, like in the wee hour. [[01:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4482.66s)]
*  But shit doesn't get as weird either. [[01:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4484.0199999999995s)]
*  You're not, you know... [[01:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4485.62s)]
*  I feel like I say it in one of my songs, but I feel like past 2 a.m. [[01:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4486.5s)]
*  It's like nothing's happening. [[01:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4491.3s)]
*  You're like all sitting around a screen watching YouTube videos and like chatting [[01:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4493.62s)]
*  about the YouTube videos. [[01:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4497.94s)]
*  Whereas I think like I feel like my friends call me the sparkler because I shine bright [[01:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4498.98s)]
*  for a very short period of time. [[01:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4504.74s)]
*  So I'll go out at 8 and I'll be home at 11. [[01:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4506.0199999999995s)]
*  But in those three hours, like I'll have fun. [[01:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4508.34s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4510.58s)]
*  Oh, that's a good guy to be. [[01:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4511.14s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4513.14s)]
*  I'm going to start working on that. [[01:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4513.94s)]
*  I'm going to save up all my good stuff for 8 to 11. [[01:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4516.0199999999995s)]
*  8 to 11 is a great time as well. [[01:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4519.46s)]
*  And then you're in bed by midnight. [[01:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4522.099999999999s)]
*  I usually get up at like 5 a.m. anyway. [[01:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4523.38s)]
*  So you're like in bed by midnight and then you're fresh-ish in the morning. [[01:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4525.54s)]
*  You work out, Guy? [[01:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4530.02s)]
*  Yeah, I like to work out, man. [[01:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4531.22s)]
*  It's fun. [[01:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4532.5s)]
*  Nothing too crazy, but I do like it. [[01:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4533.06s)]
*  But like every morning you'll do a bit of exercise. [[01:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4534.66s)]
*  Yeah, four days a week I'll work out. [[01:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4536.66s)]
*  Cool. [[01:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4538.18s)]
*  Pretty swell. [[01:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4538.5s)]
*  I like doing the sauna. [[01:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4539.06s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4540.5s)]
*  Ice bath. [[01:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4541.14s)]
*  And I like doing the ice bath, man. [[01:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4541.78s)]
*  I don't know if they work or not, but they tricked me into believing they do. [[01:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4543.46s)]
*  For me, it's less... [[01:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4547.14s)]
*  I don't mind if they work or not, but it gets my core body temperature down. [[01:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4549.14s)]
*  I'm a big sweater. [[01:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4552.82s)]
*  Oh, you really? [[01:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4554.26s)]
*  Yeah, I sweat like if I'm on stage, I just drip, drip, drip. [[01:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4554.98s)]
*  You're just leaking up? [[01:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4559.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4560.34s)]
*  Well, I think there's something in the Irish blood where I heat just does not agree with me. [[01:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4560.5s)]
*  Because you brought your own heat. [[01:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4568.34s)]
*  Of course, the sun would be like, who the fuck is this? [[01:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4572.179999999999s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[01:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4577.219999999999s)]
*  Stepping on my turf right here. [[01:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4578.179999999999s)]
*  But if I go in a sauna, I'll usually be sweating for like three, four hours. [[01:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4580.58s)]
*  Oh, damn. [[01:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4584.58s)]
*  Getting in an ice bath almost, it's kind of like cauterizing a wound. [[01:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4585.14s)]
*  You just... It's done. [[01:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4589.78s)]
*  Dude, Ireland was so... I never had seen... I grew up in New Orleans, right? [[01:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4591.94s)]
*  In that area in Louisiana, like Mardi Gras, people being drunk, right? [[01:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4596.9s)]
*  I never say it's a different thing of drunkenness. [[01:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4601.46s)]
*  It's just in the... It's like people... We went into a bar. [[01:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4605.78s)]
*  It's people in there. There's no furniture, right? [[01:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4608.74s)]
*  Just people holding each other up. [[01:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4611.38s)]
*  Drinking. It's like you can't even let the guy stop drinking. [[01:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4614.0199999999995s)]
*  They won't fucking let... [[01:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4617.3s)]
*  Dude, I remember we're in the bar, outside of the bar, [[01:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4618.98s)]
*  they built another bar around the exit door. [[01:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4621.62s)]
*  You open the exit to the bar, you're in another fucking bar, dude. [[01:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4623.94s)]
*  The drinking culture here is different than America. [[01:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4626.9s)]
*  Like we would... Like I found when I lived in Nashville, it was like sports bars. [[01:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4630.5s)]
*  You go to a sports bar to watch a game, to drink, [[01:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4636.26s)]
*  and you would see people there on their own drinking a huge vodka tonic, [[01:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4640.5s)]
*  just like, I'm here to get fucking drunk. [[01:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4644.34s)]
*  There's Irish bars on the motorway in America. [[01:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4646.5s)]
*  I'm like, who the fuck is driving to an Irish bar? [[01:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4648.820000000001s)]
*  But here, if I'm like... For instance, I saw my best mate Nick yesterday, [[01:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4653.62s)]
*  and I was like, oh, let's go out for a couple of pints, [[01:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4658.18s)]
*  and we would go out and we caught up, and we had three pints of beer, [[01:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4660.18s)]
*  and then that was it. [[01:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4664.02s)]
*  And that it's... Our culture here is very much built around... [[01:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4665.3s)]
*  You know, I'm generalizing, not everyone loves drinking, [[01:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4670.26s)]
*  but I would say like 80% of the people in England love a beer every now and then. [[01:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4673.860000000001s)]
*  Or so, and you would go out, and instead of getting shit canned every time you go out, [[01:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4677.780000000001s)]
*  you know, like I would go to these sports bars, and it was basically like everyone [[01:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4682.18s)]
*  in the sports bar in America would be going with the sole purpose to be dribbly drunk [[01:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4685.860000000001s)]
*  by the end of the night, taken home in an Uber. [[01:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4690.58s)]
*  Whereas in England, it's very much... [[01:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4692.74s)]
*  And Ireland, and Scotland, and Wales, it's a regular... [[01:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4695.139999999999s)]
*  With my friendship group anyway, a regular thing to have maybe like one or two pints [[01:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4699.46s)]
*  at the end of a workday, and then maybe on a Friday, you'll have like six pints, [[01:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4705.219999999999s)]
*  a bottle of wine, you'll go out and do the shots and blah, blah, blah. [[01:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4708.98s)]
*  But it's far more just part of the culture to do it regularly. [[01:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4712.42s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah, it seems like they wear it better here. [[01:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4716.98s)]
*  It's not alcoholism to drink every day here. [[01:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4720.339999999999s)]
*  Whereas in America, if you're drunk every day, it'd be alcoholism. [[01:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4723.86s)]
*  Because obviously people take it too far here as well, but the general thing, I think, [[01:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4726.98s)]
*  is... Am I right in saying that, lads? [[01:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4732.339999999999s)]
*  Like you would go out for a couple of pints after this and it wouldn't be like... [[01:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4733.7s)]
*  Well, I think we treat every event with beer. [[01:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4736.179999999999s)]
*  You're sad, have a beer. Are you happy, have a beer. [[01:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4740.179999999999s)]
*  Is it a wedding, have a beer. Is it a funeral, have a beer. [[01:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4742.5s)]
*  But it's not alcoholism, it's the culture. [[01:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4746.099999999999s)]
*  It's just the culture. [[01:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4748.74s)]
*  It's not like I wake up every morning and I'm like, I need a beer tonight. [[01:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4749.54s)]
*  It's like you get to the end of the day and your mate will be like, [[01:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4753.46s)]
*  oh, I'm in central London, do you want to go for a beer? [[01:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4756.5s)]
*  Rather than like, I need a beer. [[01:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4758.42s)]
*  It just... [[01:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4760.82s)]
*  Right. Yeah, that's interesting, dude. [[01:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4761.3s)]
*  Because a lot like by the definition of alcoholism, everybody can decide for himself [[01:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4763.3s)]
*  if they're an alcoholic. That's one thing I know about that program. [[01:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4768.98s)]
*  You have to decide. There can be the rules that kind of help you decide, [[01:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4772.26s)]
*  but it's a personal decision, right? [[01:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4775.78s)]
*  But yeah, people would look at a lot of people in Ireland and be like, [[01:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4778.18s)]
*  oh, everybody here is an alcoholic, nine out of 10 people. [[01:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4781.14s)]
*  Even some people in comas or whatever drinking, you're like, that's... [[01:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4786.9800000000005s)]
*  New. But yeah, but it's not the same because it's part of the culture. [[01:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4791.9400000000005s)]
*  Oh, I agree. When you say that, it's like... [[01:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4797.700000000001s)]
*  Because I don't... [[01:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4799.62s)]
*  I actually don't like the culture of people viewing Ireland as like an alcoholic country. [[01:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4800.900000000001s)]
*  It's not. They... [[01:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4808.34s)]
*  We can have a good time, but it's not like... [[01:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4811.94s)]
*  It's the same in England. It's just the culture. [[01:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4815.62s)]
*  Yeah, I agree. But they're good. [[01:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4820.74s)]
*  Germany's the same. [[01:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4822.259999999999s)]
*  It surprises me how good at it they are. I think that's what surprised me. [[01:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4823.0599999999995s)]
*  Just that like... [[01:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4826.98s)]
*  Practice. [[01:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4827.62s)]
*  Wow. [[01:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4828.66s)]
*  Also, we drink from a very young age, irresponsibly or responsibly, but like, [[01:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4828.9s)]
*  I had my first beer when I was like 12, 13, and you learn how to manage your alcohol by the age of 16. [[01:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4834.02s)]
*  You know, if I drink this many cans of Strongbow, I'm probably going to throw up, [[01:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4842.740000000001s)]
*  so I'll drink this many cans of Strongbow. [[01:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4846.740000000001s)]
*  Whereas I think in America, it's very much like 17, 18, 19. [[01:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4848.5s)]
*  Maybe it's even just getting to college for the first time where you're then [[01:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4852.18s)]
*  finding out what your boundaries are. [[01:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4855.38s)]
*  France, they start drinking wine from like five. [[01:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4857.3s)]
*  Oh, God. [[01:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4859.46s)]
*  They give tiny glass of wine to their kids and it makes them respect alcohol. [[01:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4860.74s)]
*  I'd watch that online if they had that. [[01:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4866.34s)]
*  To be honest, no judgment or anything, and I don't know any of the children, [[01:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4872.26s)]
*  but I wouldn't want to know any of them, but I would watch them drink a little bit of wine. [[01:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4875.14s)]
*  Especially if you can't do anything bad on the screen or whatever. [[01:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4881.860000000001s)]
*  There's a YouTube video. [[01:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4885.14s)]
*  I actually wanted to do it for one of my songs, [[01:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4886.02s)]
*  Bloodstream, was to have a video of compilations of babies trying lemons. [[01:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4887.86s)]
*  Get up, get up, babies trying lemons for the first time. [[01:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4892.099999999999s)]
*  Here we go. [[01:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4894.58s)]
*  This is so good. [[01:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4895.78s)]
*  Whoa, he couldn't handle it. [[01:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4914.98s)]
*  Anyway, we're good. [[01:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4918.5s)]
*  We're good. [[01:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4920.339999999999s)]
*  We're good. [[01:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4920.66s)]
*  Oh, that's remarkable. [[01:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4921.54s)]
*  Do you think about like what else you want to do in life? [[01:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4923.139999999999s)]
*  Yeah, or just like, yeah, do you start thinking about like, [[01:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4928.9s)]
*  oh, what's something new you want to do? [[01:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4931.139999999999s)]
*  Getting to do that movie thing sounded really cool to me. [[01:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4932.259999999999s)]
*  I'm going to segue into, I've been doing probably for the last seven years, [[01:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4934.42s)]
*  stuff with music in high schools because in my area, so basically when I, in like 2017, [[01:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4940.42s)]
*  2018, my old music teacher came to me and he was like, look, the government is currently in charge, [[01:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4947.46s)]
*  do not value art at all, like arts, drama, music, and they cut all the funding for comprehensive. [[01:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4953.38s)]
*  Oh my God. [[01:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4960.42s)]
*  So my music teacher came to me and he was like, look, we're going, I think they had to share like [[01:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4961.78s)]
*  between art, music and drama, like 700 pounds per year, like for all three subjects. [[01:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4965.54s)]
*  So I started funding that at my local high school and then you see like massive uptick [[01:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4970.74s)]
*  in like kids doing production, kids doing songwriting, kids doing this. [[01:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4976.98s)]
*  So then I just started keep putting it, I built a recording studio there. [[01:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4980.0199999999995s)]
*  There's like loads of like proper instruments that aren't broken and you just see the school [[01:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4983.78s)]
*  getting better at music. [[01:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4989.94s)]
*  So then I started doing that in the county that I'm from and we've just now changed it to do it [[01:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4991.139999999999s)]
*  nationwide and I'm now visiting more high schools and places that really need music funding and you [[01:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=4997.0599999999995s)]
*  see what a difference it makes to, because I'm not an academic person and in the real world, [[01:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=5005.38s)]
*  I would be viewed as stupid, but I excelled at music and therefore people think that I'm good [[01:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=5012.1s)]
*  at something and so I found it massively helpful to be in a state funded school that [[01:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=5018.02s)]
*  really encouraged that and they've basically cut funding in England for it. [[01:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=5024.02s)]
*  So I'm doing what I can to get funding for it, but I think getting the new government [[01:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=5028.18s)]
*  will be better at it, I think. [[01:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=5035.46s)]
*  That's remarkable. [[01:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=5036.9800000000005s)]
*  But the thing that like that's kind of what I want to segue into is music education because [[01:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=5038.18s)]
*  it worked so well for me and I know it can work so well for other kids. [[01:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=5043.780000000001s)]
*  I'm kind of like proof that normal kids can just pick up guitars, work hard and do it. [[01:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=5047.62s)]
*  Our country as well, what we're famous for is our art. [[01:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=5055.219999999999s)]
*  We're famous for music, with The Beatles, we're famous for painting, [[01:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=5059.0599999999995s)]
*  Damien Hirst, we're famous for movies. [[01:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=5062.5s)]
*  You've got like Danny Ball coming out of here, Christopher Nolan and the government is just [[01:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=5064.259999999999s)]
*  putting importance on maths and banking and we make arms, but no one is proud that we make arms [[01:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=5069.46s)]
*  and no one is proud that our banking is really good, but they are proud of our art and so for [[01:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=5078.42s)]
*  a government to be like the art doesn't matter. [[01:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=5082.98s)]
*  Like where do you think the art's going to come from? [[01:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=5086.179999999999s)]
*  So I think that for me is the next part of my career is getting proper, proper, proper funding [[01:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=5088.0199999999995s)]
*  in art, music, drama back into schools and actually Ireland do a very good job of it. [[01:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=5095.299999999999s)]
*  Ireland are very, very pro their arts because they know that that's their cultural currency. [[01:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=5101.139999999999s)]
*  You too travel the world and they see that. [[01:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=5105.379999999999s)]
*  Bernsheis of Inner Sheeran comes out, everyone goes to watch that movie and [[01:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=5108.0199999999995s)]
*  they're, they, Ireland are very, very good at recognizing that and funding. [[01:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=5112.42s)]
*  There's lots of Irish. [[01:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=5116.66s)]
*  The sons of pride there too still. [[01:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=5118.1s)]
*  Because people travel around the world as Irish superstars in all aspects and they spread, [[01:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=5119.94s)]
*  people are like, oh Ireland's awesome because so and so comes from Ireland, [[01:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=5127.3s)]
*  so and so comes from Ireland and it's the same in, in, in England. [[01:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=5130.1s)]
*  Like British music, there's Adele, there's Harry Styles, there's Stormzy, there's me, there's like [[01:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=5132.9s)]
*  musicians travel the world and we people are like, oh, that's a, that's a British musician [[01:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=5137.38s)]
*  or that's a, you know, British artist or a British actor or actress and that's what we as a country [[01:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=5141.3s)]
*  are proud of. [[01:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=5147.86s)]
*  We're proud of our football as well, but in terms of like art and it's so weird that [[01:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=5148.42s)]
*  no importance is being put on it. [[01:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=5155.3s)]
*  It's not even that importance isn't being put on it. [[01:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=5156.82s)]
*  It's like completely stripping the importance of it and just being like, this doesn't matter. [[01:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=5158.9s)]
*  But I'm sorry to get all... [[01:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=5162.66s)]
*  No, but when you, when you kill that in a culture, it's horrible, man. [[01:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=5164.179999999999s)]
*  Even like you said, like when you said earlier about like going to that NBA game, right? [[01:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=5167.78s)]
*  You don't realize till you sit there at the front row or until you get close to something [[01:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=5171.38s)]
*  how important it is or what, or if you could even be good at it. [[01:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=5176.74s)]
*  Like I remember standup comedy, I'd seen it like videos, people had like [[01:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=5180.0199999999995s)]
*  DVDs would get passed around the neighborhood like Chris Rock and stuff like that. [[01:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=5185.219999999999s)]
*  And I'm like, oh, this is cool. [[01:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=5188.5s)]
*  But until I was in college and actually went to a show, not then, [[01:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=5189.7s)]
*  until that moment, did it hit me like... [[01:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=5193.94s)]
*  This is what I could do. [[01:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=5196.0199999999995s)]
*  Oh, that this is even a thing that you could do. [[01:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=5196.9s)]
*  Like just seeing it on a screen, it just didn't, it didn't really tabulate. [[01:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=5199.38s)]
*  Am I right to assume that in school you will probably be like, [[01:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=5205.0599999999995s)]
*  I don't know what I want to do. [[01:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=5207.94s)]
*  What am I good at? [[01:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=5208.98s)]
*  I'm not very good at history. [[01:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=5209.62s)]
*  I'm not very good at English. [[01:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=5210.5s)]
*  I'm not very good at this. [[01:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=5211.299999999999s)]
*  And then suddenly you find comedy and you go, [[01:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=5212.099999999999s)]
*  this is something that I can really excel in. [[01:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=5214.9s)]
*  I think unless you give kids that opportunity and also I feel like [[01:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=5216.9s)]
*  you can destroy a kid's confidence at age 12 by just being like, [[01:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=5221.7s)]
*  yeah, you're not very good at that. [[01:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=5226.5s)]
*  And if you give a kid... [[01:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=5227.94s)]
*  I was given confidence by my music teacher, by my dad, by my friends. [[01:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=5229.94s)]
*  When I wasn't very good at all, I listened back to the music [[01:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=5234.34s)]
*  that I was making when I was like 14. [[01:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=5236.82s)]
*  And my friends were nice. [[01:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=5238.0199999999995s)]
*  Yeah, I listened back and I go, I go fucking hell. [[01:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=5239.7s)]
*  My dad was not honest. [[01:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=5242.74s)]
*  Because he was just like, this is great. [[01:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=5245.46s)]
*  And my confidence was built and it's got to a point where I then was like, [[01:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=5246.66s)]
*  I'm going to release my first single and I'm going to make a music video. [[01:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=5250.74s)]
*  And then that was the song that got successful. [[01:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=5253.78s)]
*  And had I been like, I don't know what people are going to think about that. [[01:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=5255.78s)]
*  I think that's also like changing the culture of that of like... [[01:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=5258.74s)]
*  Like I went up to Sheffield the other day to do a couple of school and music course visits. [[01:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=5262.58s)]
*  And they were amazing. [[01:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=5270.5s)]
*  Like way better than I was at 14. [[01:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=5272.42s)]
*  And I feel like all it takes is for someone to be like, [[01:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=5274.98s)]
*  you're really, really good at this. [[01:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=5277.139999999999s)]
*  And then they go, oh, well, then I should carry on. [[01:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=5278.26s)]
*  And... [[01:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=5280.74s)]
*  Well, having the equipment, like you're saying, like putting that equipment in schools, [[01:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=5281.62s)]
*  dude, that's so cool. [[01:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=5284.5s)]
*  Because if you have a camera and you have like a podcast set up or something, [[01:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=5285.54s)]
*  you can record something and you can see how it looks. [[01:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=5290.5s)]
*  The second you do that one step, now you're in a whole new purview or whatever. [[01:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=5292.82s)]
*  And the next step. [[01:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=5298.42s)]
*  And then you're like, now what's possible? [[01:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=5298.98s)]
*  It's like, but until you can get that first step. [[01:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=5300.26s)]
*  You do your first show and you go, right, well, I've done one. [[01:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=5303.3s)]
*  Wasn't that good. [[01:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=5305.78s)]
*  I'll go and do it again. [[01:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=5306.42s)]
*  I'll make it better. [[01:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=5307.14s)]
*  And then it just improves. [[01:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=5307.78s)]
*  You don't know what part of you wants to do until you like... [[01:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=5309.54s)]
*  It's almost like a metal detector. [[01:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=5313.14s)]
*  You're like a metal detector. [[01:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=5314.5s)]
*  And until you kind of go over that little whatever that is [[01:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=5316.02s)]
*  and something inside you kind of goes off, you know. [[01:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=5319.22s)]
*  And well, because all you need to do that. [[01:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=5322.02s)]
*  That's the thing as well that I say to kids. [[01:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=5323.7s)]
*  I'm like, you only need one thing that you're good at. [[01:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=5325.3s)]
*  You just find the one thing that you enjoy that you're good at. [[01:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=5327.78s)]
*  And you just work really hard at that. [[01:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=5330.26s)]
*  And then it will work. [[01:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=5332.26s)]
*  You go like the music industry is... [[01:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=5333.38s)]
*  If you want to work in the music industry, you can. [[01:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=5336.58s)]
*  Like I was... [[01:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=5338.9s)]
*  The day that I made it in my mind was I was gigging around, [[01:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=5341.139999999999s)]
*  gigging around, not getting paid. [[01:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=5344.74s)]
*  I got booked for a wedding and I played this wedding for like £200. [[01:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=5346.0199999999995s)]
*  And I remember getting that £200 cash being like, [[01:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=5349.7s)]
*  oh my God, this is half my rent for playing a gig. [[01:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=5352.58s)]
*  "- Looks like we made it." [[01:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=5356.099999999999s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=5357.62s)]
*  And in my mind then I was like, [[01:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=5358.179999999999s)]
*  I could just play weddings for the rest of my life and I'm fine. [[01:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=5359.62s)]
*  I can do music. [[01:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=5362.42s)]
*  And it's about finding the, you know, me getting £200 [[01:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=5363.139999999999s)]
*  for playing covers at a wedding isn't me playing Wembley Stadium [[01:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=5367.3s)]

*  shaking my hand and smiling. [[01:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=5444.66s)]

*  And actually a comedian had just told her a joke. [[01:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=5449.38s)]
*  So it looks like she's really happy to meet me, [[01:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=5451.94s)]
*  but she had no idea who I was at all. [[01:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=5453.86s)]

*  There you go. [[01:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=5457.86s)]

*  Do the queen, do the royal people, what do they do? [[01:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=5459.38s)]
*  What is it really like over there when you go over there? [[01:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=5462.82s)]
*  "- I don't think it's... [[01:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=5465.219999999999s)]
*  I don't envy it at all. [[01:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=5467.139999999999s)]
*  I wouldn't want to live that lifestyle. [[01:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=5468.82s)]
*  I remember being in Japan once for the Rugby World Cup [[01:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=5471.62s)]
*  and I met one of them and he was like, [[01:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=5476.0199999999995s)]
*  you know, he's six, seven years older than me. [[01:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=5479.0599999999995s)]
*  And he was like, this is my first time in Japan. [[01:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=5481.299999999999s)]
*  And in my mind, I'm like, I would have just assumed [[01:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=5483.22s)]
*  that you go everywhere all the time, [[01:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=5485.3s)]
*  but I think it's very much like it's a working job. [[01:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=5487.22s)]
*  They go and open hospitals, open care centers, [[01:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=5490.02s)]
*  go and do this, go and do this. [[01:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=5492.58s)]
*  And it's... [[01:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=5493.54s)]
*  I wouldn't envy the lifestyle at all. [[01:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=5494.820000000001s)]
*  I think it is quite restrictive. [[01:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=5496.66s)]
*  I don't think you can just be like, I'm going to go do this. [[01:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=5498.66s)]
*  I think like, have you seen The Crown, the show? [[01:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=5501.14s)]
*  Because like even when they go on holiday, [[01:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=5503.7s)]
*  they go on holiday and they have to do like a press shoot before the holiday. [[01:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=5505.46s)]
*  And then people just take photos of them for the whole holiday. [[01:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=5509.38s)]
*  It's kind of like you allow because you are funded by the public, [[01:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=5511.7s)]
*  the public own your life. [[01:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=5515.46s)]
*  Yeah, it's kind of cool. [[01:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=5517.22s)]
*  We are, don't we? [[01:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=5518.099999999999s)]
*  Yeah. So it's not something that I would necessarily envy. [[01:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=5518.9s)]
*  It's something that... [[01:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=5522.42s)]
*  It's a big debate in this country whether people agree with it or not. [[01:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=5523.3s)]
*  I personally like think it gives a certain like grounding for the... [[01:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=5526.66s)]
*  There's like a historical aspect of it. [[01:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=5532.26s)]
*  And when things happen, it's like Americans love seeing the ceremony that's over here. [[01:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=5534.34s)]
*  Like when the Queen passed away, the funeral is like very impressive. [[01:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=5538.5s)]
*  And it very much, I don't know, represents England for the world. [[01:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=5542.5s)]
*  You know, England, look at it. [[01:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=5548.9800000000005s)]
*  Yeah, because I think England, there's something there. [[01:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=5550.02s)]
*  There are a lot of great things. [[01:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=5551.62s)]
*  It's like very proper and it's like... [[01:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=5552.82s)]
*  There's a lot of things that I would not agree with as well. [[01:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=5554.42s)]
*  I think it is very like... [[01:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=5556.66s)]
*  It's rigid almost. [[01:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=5558.1s)]
*  It's a very polarizing subject. [[01:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=5558.9800000000005s)]
*  But yeah, but I definitely wouldn't envy the lifestyle. [[01:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=5562.1s)]
*  Oh yeah, it seems like it would be tough. [[01:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=5567.14s)]
*  Like you're such a con... [[01:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=5568.900000000001s)]
*  And you have to be a concierge to your own country and you have to be such a representative. [[01:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=5569.9400000000005s)]
*  I never talk about anything negative. [[01:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=5574.1s)]
*  Their thing, they say never complain, never explain. [[01:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=5577.46s)]
*  So anything that happens, they just... [[01:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=5580.18s)]
*  Right, you're just a middleman. [[01:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=5582.34s)]
*  Yeah, you can't show any emotion. [[01:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=5583.62s)]
*  Like even at like funerals and stuff, like you know, no one's a cry and stuff. [[01:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=5585.3s)]
*  It's like really quite hardcore. [[01:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=5588.58s)]
*  Yeah, gosh, I remember my first funeral, dude. [[01:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=5592.58s)]
*  Not fun, are they? [[01:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=5594.98s)]
*  I was not good at funerals. [[01:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=5596.58s)]
*  No. [[01:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=5598.0199999999995s)]
*  I was the worst dude. [[01:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=5598.419999999999s)]
*  I feel like they're then needed to mark it though. [[01:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=5600.419999999999s)]
*  I missed my grandmother's funeral. [[01:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=5603.219999999999s)]
*  I was doing... [[01:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=5605.219999999999s)]
*  Did you see that court case last year that I was in? [[01:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=5606.0199999999995s)]
*  You know about that? [[01:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=5608.0199999999995s)]
*  I was in a court case last year and we... [[01:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=5608.82s)]
*  All my friends are criminals to be honest with you. [[01:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=5610.82s)]
*  She died at the start of the court case and the funeral was like midway through it [[01:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=5613.62s)]
*  because she had to be buried. [[01:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=5619.78s)]
*  And you couldn't go. [[01:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=5621.78s)]
*  And you couldn't go. [[01:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=5623.7s)]
*  I couldn't and I still feel weird about it that there was no marking of the like, [[01:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=5624.9s)]
*  you know, seeing a coffin be put into a grave and covered and I don't know, [[01:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=5629.94s)]
*  there's something in me that's like even like visiting her grave now, there's not... [[01:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=5634.82s)]
*  It still feels like an open book, open door, I guess. [[01:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=5638.82s)]
*  I think funerals are important for the ceremony of like marking it. [[01:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=5642.82s)]
*  It's kind of like the first day of grief as well because before you go to a funeral, [[01:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=5646.179999999999s)]
*  there's like a weird month or whatever where everything's like really fucking intense [[01:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=5651.38s)]
*  and grief stricken and then kind of the funeral is the day that you go, [[01:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=5655.9400000000005s)]
*  now we start processing it. [[01:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=5659.62s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=5660.82s)]
*  Yeah, it is kind of wild, dude. [[01:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=5662.1s)]
*  Does any of your music get played at funerals too or not? [[01:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=5664.02s)]
*  Yeah, I've got a song that I wrote about my grandmother called Supermarket Flowers, [[01:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=5666.5s)]
*  which is a popular funeral song. [[01:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=5669.62s)]
*  If that's like a thing to be proud of, like I've got a popular funeral song. [[01:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=5672.900000000001s)]
*  But yeah. [[01:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=5676.900000000001s)]
*  It's such an important... [[01:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=5677.3s)]
*  It's a song that... [[01:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=5678.18s)]
*  It's a moment that people don't think of that much that needs a song kind of in a way maybe. [[01:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=5679.14s)]
*  Or I don't know, as a songwriter, maybe people do think about specific moments that need songs, but... [[01:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=5682.900000000001s)]
*  I definitely do. [[01:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=5687.22s)]
*  Like I definitely know what I would have at my funeral. [[01:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=5688.02s)]
*  Same as I would have at my wedding, you know? [[01:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=5692.66s)]
*  What tune do you want? [[01:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=5696.26s)]
*  There's an Irish folk song, which is like always the final song that is sung on a folk night, [[01:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=5697.860000000001s)]
*  which is called The Parting Glass, where it's like... [[01:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=5703.22s)]
*  Are the Pogues or no? [[01:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=5706.5s)]
*  No, it's like traditional. [[01:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=5707.78s)]
*  It's... [[01:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=5710.5s)]
*  And it's basically like all of the things I did. [[01:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=5724.259999999999s)]
*  And it's basically the last drink of the night. [[01:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=5737.78s)]
*  This is... [[01:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=5742.259999999999s)]
*  I sort of feel weird that I just sung on... [[01:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=5744.98s)]
*  No, but it's a farewell. [[01:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=5747.0599999999995s)]
*  But yeah, it's the last drink of the night and it's basically everything that's happened, [[01:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=5748.34s)]
*  it's happened. [[01:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=5753.0599999999995s)]
*  And let's have this final drink and then get on with our lives. [[01:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=5754.0199999999995s)]
*  I think that's quite a nice way to like go out of this world, basically being like, [[01:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=5756.98s)]
*  of all the comrades that ever I've had, I'm sorry that I'm going away, you know? [[01:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=5760.9s)]
*  It's just a message to people. [[01:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=5767.94s)]
*  I like it. [[01:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=5769.0599999999995s)]
*  No, man. [[01:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=5770.179999999999s)]

*  It's nice, man. [[01:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=5772.74s)]
*  From everyone that's ever spoken about you, I've heard you always seem like a person that [[01:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=5774.5s)]
*  just shares the gift of who you are with the world as clearly as you know how to [[01:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=5777.54s)]
*  and navigate that the best you can, man. [[01:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=5782.099999999999s)]
*  So I appreciate you singing. [[01:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=5784.099999999999s)]
*  That's nice, dude. [[01:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=5785.219999999999s)]

*  Thanks for coming as well, man. [[01:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=5788.9s)]
*  I really, really have enjoyed this. [[01:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=5789.86s)]
*  I feel bad that I reference the term ginger and I feel bad [[01:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=5791.379999999999s)]
*  that I mispronounced the name of this place, man. [[01:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=5795.14s)]
*  Oh, that's all right. [[01:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=5797.780000000001s)]
*  I thought you were doing it on purpose. [[01:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=5798.740000000001s)]
*  Okay, I was. [[01:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=5800.5s)]
*  All good. [[01:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=5801.14s)]
*  No, no, the ginger thing. [[01:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=5801.54s)]
*  And I wasn't. [[01:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=5802.9800000000005s)]
*  The ginger thing, I'm actually like, I have a good sense of humor, so I'm fun with being... [[01:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=5803.9400000000005s)]
*  Yeah, I just shouldn't have said it though. [[01:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=5808.42s)]
*  No, but I'm like, my point is if this is on limits, then, you know, other things should be too. [[01:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=5809.9400000000005s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=5817.54s)]
*  You know, it shouldn't be the only thing that's on limits. [[01:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=5817.860000000001s)]
*  Oh, I agree, brother. [[01:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=5820.18s)]
*  And let me tell you this, we're turning on all the limits. [[01:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=5821.62s)]
*  We'll get you out to a live show and turning on all the limits. [[01:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=5828.74s)]
*  I hope you make a million more wonderful songs and just keep blessing us with your gifts. [[01:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=5831.38s)]
*  Thank you so much, Ed Sheeran. [[01:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=5836.74s)]

*  I can feel it in my bones. [[01:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=5855.7s)]
*  But it's gonna take... [[01:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guspc7G92Gs&t=5860.34s)]
