*  Yeah. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=142.52s)]
*  But is it a surprise? [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=143.52s)]
*  Because we usually know. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=144.52s)]
*  We almost always know you don't have a good. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=145.96s)]
*  This I had no idea. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=147.92000000000002s)]

*  Right. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=155.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=156.2s)]
*  You get congested. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=157.2s)]
*  He just couldn't handle it. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=158.2s)]
*  I think there was something inside of him. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=159.2s)]
*  The Lord maybe. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=161.04s)]
*  And you'd see him start to fucking kind of bubble up a little like a fucking, like he [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=162.04s)]
*  was made out of champagne, you know, just, you know, and the dude, the crazy, the hero [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=165.68s)]
*  was the crazy part though, dude. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=169.8s)]
*  Years later, it's just, he got started getting around his son and then he started fucking [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=173.56s)]
*  losing his mind. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=178.0s)]
*  He thought his son was a gay. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=179.0s)]
*  And he wasn't. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=182.04000000000002s)]
*  We don't know. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=183.04000000000002s)]

*  Can you look that up? [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=190.48000000000002s)]
*  I think there might be. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=193.20000000000002s)]
*  Well that it does make sense. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=194.8s)]
*  They, they're more exposed. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=196.76000000000002s)]

*  Wow. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=206.28s)]
*  You know, it says who should not go to high altitudes? [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=207.28s)]
*  Is it, should gay people go to high altitudes or no? [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=208.6s)]
*  Well, it says sickle cell. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=211.72s)]
*  So brothers aren't allowed up there. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=213.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=214.68s)]
*  No way. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=215.68s)]
*  But you know, that's probably, it's closer to God. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=216.68s)]
*  So you know, you're up there. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=218.68s)]
*  You got to be careful. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=221.48s)]
*  He likes who he likes. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=222.48s)]
*  That's right. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=223.56s)]
*  That's all we're saying, dude. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=224.56s)]

*  Oh yeah. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=518.96s)]
*  Dude, yeah, so bad for you guys. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=520.44s)]
*  You guys just like fucking, it was a perfect combination, man. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=524.2s)]
*  It was a good time. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=528.24s)]
*  It was great timing. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=529.24s)]
*  And then the pandemic helped the show. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=530.36s)]
*  But when Bobby went back to rehab, which I've sent him to three times, we're trying to keep [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=532.96s)]
*  him safe and clean and he's doing a great job. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=537.24s)]
*  But when he went back to rehab after his dad died, the story goes that he relapsed. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=540.02s)]
*  I knew. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=546.5600000000001s)]
*  Almost nobody knew. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=547.96s)]
*  I knew that anybody really knew. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=548.96s)]
*  Like, people kind of talked to him. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=549.96s)]
*  Maybe there was suspicion that he was acting weird, but he's a weirdo. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=551.84s)]
*  So it's like, how do you really? [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=555.72s)]
*  But then he was hiding out a lot. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=557.08s)]
*  I knew. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=558.44s)]
*  He told me not to tell anybody. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=559.44s)]
*  I got real uncomfortable. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=560.44s)]
*  I kind of started to, you know, question like, I'll just ruin our friendship, I guess, and [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=562.48s)]
*  tell them, and tell people. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=569.76s)]
*  Right. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=571.1600000000001s)]
*  Because he was like, I'll never talk to you again if you tell anybody that I'm using. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=572.1600000000001s)]
*  So I was like, well, fuck it. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=574.84s)]
*  I guess I'll just lose a friend. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=577.0s)]
*  And then really before I started to go after and tell people, Kalyla came at me and was [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=578.2s)]
*  like, I knew he's using and I knew he like used you against me to try to hide it. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=584.88s)]
*  You know, and she's like, I'm sorry you had to go through that. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=590.32s)]
*  But then finally he admitted it to me and he apologized and was like, I'll go get help. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=592.1600000000001s)]
*  And I said, when he goes, when I get out, we'll start the show. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=596.2s)]
*  Because Kalyla, when I had filled in for Tiger Belly, she had been like, go do a show together. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=599.2800000000001s)]
*  Because the fans wanted it and people talked about it. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=603.76s)]
*  So when he got out and he got clean, that's when we started it. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=606.0s)]
*  And then three months into it, pandemic hit. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=607.8s)]
*  It was almost like a gift from God because then we got to just shoot all the time and [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=610.8s)]
*  be together in the studio. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=614.28s)]
*  I mean, truly, it was, you know. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=615.28s)]
*  And you need that. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=617.52s)]
*  If you're really building one, I think you've got to have time. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=618.52s)]
*  I think that's one thing that I didn't realize, I think, over the years is just like how much [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=621.0799999999999s)]
*  time it takes to do a podcast. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=626.4s)]
*  There's a lot that goes into it. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=627.9599999999999s)]
*  This is a job. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=628.9599999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=629.9599999999999s)]
*  And then when I, when Joe, when I first started going on Rogan's and then I realized he does [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=630.9599999999999s)]
*  He does this job five, sometimes six days a week. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=634.4s)]
*  And then his other job and then his other job and then his other job. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=638.64s)]
*  And he still has kettlebells in his hand while he's doing it. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=642.36s)]
*  Like in the middle of it, he's just ripping bells. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=644.96s)]
*  He's the most impressive work ethic I've ever seen in my entire life. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=648.64s)]
*  Hands down. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=652.56s)]
*  Work ethic is through the roof and then open a comedy club and change the scene. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=653.56s)]
*  It's ridiculous. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=656.84s)]
*  It's like for anyone that has any doubts or any questions or even thoughts about him that [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=657.84s)]
*  are, you know, negative or against the grain. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=661.88s)]
*  It's like you, you don't, you don't understand that guy. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=664.4s)]
*  He's a, he's a machine, a magic machine. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=666.5600000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=669.36s)]
*  I wonder how much pressure he feels. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=670.36s)]
*  And he doesn't let, if he does feel pressure, he doesn't let you see it. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=672.0s)]
*  That's what's the most amazing to me. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=676.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=677.84s)]
*  Because, well, I think he's, he's, he deals with it in the only way he knows how, which [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=678.84s)]
*  is just keep going and enjoy it. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=682.2800000000001s)]
*  One time we were sitting in the green room. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=685.0s)]
*  We were on, when I first went on tour with him, we were playing arenas and I was like, [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=686.24s)]
*  man, this is incredible. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=690.6s)]
*  You know, like I was kind of like soaking it in and he was like, yeah, but you know, [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=691.6s)]
*  don't let it get to you. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=695.04s)]
*  Meaning like just do it, enjoy it and make it seem like it's any other show. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=696.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=700.16s)]
*  And keep moving. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=701.16s)]
*  Don't let it be like overwhelming where you start thinking too much and then you get in [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=702.16s)]
*  your head about it and then it kind of consumes you. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=704.48s)]
*  And then you can become one of those people who's like, how come I'm not? [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=707.28s)]
*  How come it's not? [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=710.08s)]
*  Why am I not? [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=711.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=712.16s)]
*  Let all that bullshit go. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=713.16s)]
*  He's like, just, just be in it and keep moving. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=714.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=716.48s)]
*  He keeps it moving. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=717.48s)]
*  He keeps everything going. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=718.48s)]
*  No dwelling out of that dude. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=719.48s)]
*  It's so funny cause I think, yeah, once you get going in podcasts, you're like, you obviously [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=721.78s)]
*  want to shoot for the stars. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=725.8000000000001s)]
*  You were like, I mean, I know there was a time when we all, I feel like we're trying [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=726.94s)]
*  to not be like Rogan, but it was like, you look, you know, you shoot for the... [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=730.74s)]
*  You wanted to do what he got, what he got to do. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=734.22s)]
*  I wanted to do what he got to do. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=736.26s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=737.32s)]
*  Well, you want to do it well. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=738.32s)]

*  And we're in DC. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=798.48s)]
*  We did one show at the Constitution Hall and Theo was gracious enough to take one night [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=801.0400000000001s)]
*  off so we could do it because the schedules overlapped. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=806.36s)]
*  So you did four shows there, right? [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=808.44s)]
*  Or five, something like that. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=810.2s)]
*  Yeah, I think so. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=811.2s)]
*  And we barely sold out one and he sold out five. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=812.2s)]
*  I was like, God, dude, it was awesome. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=815.2s)]
*  But then we met in the hotel. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=818.9200000000001s)]
*  We had a great night together and we were chatting and like those. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=819.9200000000001s)]

*  Well, those moments were amazing because like the road has dull moments where you're humming [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=823.24s)]
*  along on the bus. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=827.8800000000001s)]
*  It was tough. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=829.12s)]
*  Was it? [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=830.12s)]
*  And you and Bobby are on the same bus. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=831.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=832.12s)]
*  Yeah, it was tough. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=833.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=834.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=835.12s)]
*  Cause we have our tour manager on our bus. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=836.12s)]
*  It's like a group effort. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=837.12s)]
*  Is that fun? [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=838.8s)]
*  What's it like being in that sort of a club? [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=839.8s)]
*  Like I can't imagine being on wheels with Bobby. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=841.92s)]
*  That's where it gets extremely alarming. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=844.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=846.24s)]
*  Mobile is tough with him. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=847.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=848.24s)]
*  Cause at least you're on land, you can disappear. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=849.24s)]
*  You can walk away from him. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=850.24s)]
*  A lot of Asians aren't good in motion, right? [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=851.24s)]
*  In any kind of form of motion. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=854.72s)]
*  Have you ever seen an Asian drive a boat? [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=855.72s)]
*  They're not allowed to. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=858.28s)]
*  No, that's against sea. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=859.28s)]
*  That's maritime law. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=860.36s)]
*  No Asians at sea. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=861.36s)]
*  It's an old, I think it's from World War I. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=862.36s)]
*  Well, if you think about Asians, like they don't, there's the kamikaze pilots, right? [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=865.2s)]
*  That's a no, that's, and then there's driving Asians is throughout the history of time has [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=870.76s)]
*  been traumatic. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=880.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=881.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=882.96s)]
*  Has been traumatic for people. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=883.96s)]
*  And then even like, if you go to look at like Iwo Jima, like their troops, they would hide [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=884.96s)]
*  in the tunnels or in Vietnam in the Koochi tunnels. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=888.96s)]
*  Like it's very, once they get in motion, they can't handle it. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=891.08s)]
*  Yeah, they get afraid. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=894.56s)]
*  Well, you know, it's, I think it's tough when they're like, Bob, if you ever see Bob try [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=895.56s)]
*  to like run or like walk fast, he starts to wobble. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=899.4799999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=902.52s)]
*  He'll get off axis. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=903.52s)]
*  It's kind of strange. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=904.52s)]
*  I'll have to hold him sometimes if he's in a hurry. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=905.52s)]
*  So I'll shoulder him up if he's in a hurry so we can walk in a straighter line. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=907.1199999999999s)]
*  It's nerve wracking. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=911.5799999999999s)]
*  And he has only like one muscle in his body. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=913.9599999999999s)]
*  I've seen like a MRI of him or something. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=916.4s)]
*  It's baffling because I remember he sneezed once and blew his back out. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=919.4399999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=922.8s)]
*  And his muscle moves. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=923.92s)]
*  That's what's kind of interesting. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=924.92s)]
*  The muscle at some point, he'll have a muscle just on his high shoulder. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=925.92s)]
*  If he was moving a lot, it'll move down to his leg. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=929.3199999999999s)]
*  He'll have... [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=931.8399999999999s)]
*  It swims around his body like a koi. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=932.8399999999999s)]
*  It's alarming. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=933.8399999999999s)]
*  Him on a bus was wild. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=934.8399999999999s)]
*  We did 60 some odd cities. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=938.12s)]
*  Fucking odd, dude. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=939.64s)]
*  It was wild. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=941.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=942.0s)]
*  We stopped and started, stopped and started. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=943.0s)]
*  I had a, I don't even know if you heard this through the grapevine. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=944.0s)]
*  I had a, I almost, almost had a... [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=946.2s)]
*  Well, I did have a mental breakdown with him at Dolly World. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=950.16s)]
*  Wait, Dolly World? [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=954.48s)]
*  In Tennessee, Dollywood. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=955.6s)]
*  Yeah, Dollywood. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=956.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=957.6s)]
*  Had a mental breakdown. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=958.6s)]
*  Big tits. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=959.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=960.6s)]
*  Huge. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=961.6s)]
*  What happened? [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=962.6s)]
*  So, we had just been a lot of time on the bus. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=963.6s)]
*  We were just tired of each other, man. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=964.6s)]
*  It's hard. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=965.6s)]
*  You know how it gets. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=966.6s)]
*  And then he was, we were supposed to go to Dolly World, Dollywood at a certain time, [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=967.6s)]
*  right? [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=972.12s)]
*  At a reasonable adult time, like 11.30 or noon. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=973.12s)]
*  Reasonable adult. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=976.9599999999999s)]
*  And he had slept in past when we were gonna all go together. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=977.9599999999999s)]
*  Then he threw a fit about it, that we were rushing him, which is insane. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=978.9599999999999s)]
*  What do you need to really do? [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=983.5999999999999s)]
*  You put on the kimono and let's go. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=984.5999999999999s)]
*  So we get on the bus, we go, we get to Dollywood, we get in and then he says, I want to sit [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=986.28s)]
*  down and eat a meal. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=991.48s)]
*  And I said, we just got here. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=992.48s)]
*  Let's go enjoy it. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=993.48s)]
*  All the crew is with us. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=994.64s)]
*  And he's like, I want to eat. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=996.36s)]
*  You can go do whatever you want. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=997.8s)]
*  And him and I were bickering and I just was like, you know what? [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=999.16s)]
*  You're right. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=1002.52s)]
*  I am going to go do what I want. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=1003.52s)]
*  So I left and they were all like, oh, where are you going? [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=1004.52s)]
*  And I just went on my own. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=1006.6s)]
*  I just wanted to be, some days you want to just be alone. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=1007.6s)]
*  And there was only one Uber in Pigeon Forge. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=1010.36s)]
*  There's one Uber. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=1012.76s)]
*  I'm not kidding. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=1013.76s)]
*  There's one Uber and the dude and his girlfriend were driving. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=1014.76s)]
*  That was the only car available. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=1018.46s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=1019.46s)]
*  And the guy calls himself Paul Revere. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=1020.46s)]
*  Yeah, which I don't like it. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=1021.96s)]
*  I don't like it. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=1023.4s)]
*  And his girlfriend doesn't say, it doesn't make any, any comments about it. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=1024.4s)]
*  Because I said, you're not going to say anything about Paul. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=1027.48s)]
*  She's not allowed to talk. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=1029.96s)]
*  No, well, and I agree. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=1031.48s)]
*  But she, he picked me up and I had told, I had asked him where the closest airport was [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=1034.04s)]
*  because I was going to fly home to Chicago to see my parents because I was like, I need [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=1038.44s)]
*  a break. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=1041.0s)]
*  We had four days down anyway. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=1042.0s)]
*  And then they got in the Uber hours later and the same guy was like, your friend asking [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=1043.5600000000002s)]
*  for a local airport, I think he done took off. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=1048.68s)]
*  But so my phone was off. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=1050.72s)]
*  So they thought I left. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=1051.8400000000001s)]
*  They were like, he quit the tour. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=1052.8400000000001s)]
*  The tour is over. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=1053.8400000000001s)]
*  They kind of had a moment of panic and they, he deserved it because I needed a break from [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=1054.8400000000001s)]
*  him being a little brat. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=1057.76s)]
*  So it kind of like checked us. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=1060.16s)]
*  But then of course what happened afterwards, he woke up in the morning. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=1061.28s)]
*  The next day I came back to the bus and he gave me a big hug and a kiss on the cheek [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=1064.12s)]
*  and he said he was sorry. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=1067.84s)]
*  And then it was, you know, like anything is my, my brother. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=1068.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=1071.68s)]
*  But you fight your brother. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=1072.68s)]
*  You fight, you fight. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=1073.68s)]
*  Oh, being on a tour bus is hard. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=1074.68s)]
*  It sucks. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=1076.48s)]
*  You're on top of each other. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=1077.48s)]
*  It smells. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=1078.96s)]
*  Everyone's messy. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=1080.24s)]
*  Oh, especially you can hear the way. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=1081.24s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=1083.32s)]

*  You can hear him sleeping. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=1088.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=1090.16s)]
*  Somebody said he sounds kind of like a little bit of like a generator, you know, like a [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=1091.16s)]
*  bad fan belt or something. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=1096.1200000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=1097.44s)]
*  Something there's a hiccup. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=1098.44s)]
*  There's a, you know, like one thing skipping over and needs to be realigned, but he'll [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=1099.44s)]

*  Well, they're doing one special a month, which is amazing. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=1162.76s)]
*  So you can get the whole month. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=1163.76s)]
*  The lineup is insane. [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=1165.0s)]
*  I don't even know if I'm allowed to announce some of the people that are on there, but [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=1166.0s)]

*  You got to do what you're, what you're called to do. [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=1195.2s)]
*  Netflix still the top dog though. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=1197.04s)]
*  Huh? [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=1198.24s)]
*  Look at that. [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=1199.24s)]
*  Streaming services by subscribers in the world. [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=1200.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=1201.72s)]
*  They're glow. [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=1202.72s)]
*  Hulu goes global in 2025. [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=1203.72s)]
*  They're not global yet. [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=1205.44s)]
*  So next year is that's why they're doing this special. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=1206.76s)]
*  I think they're doing the specials in this regard because they want it to go global finally [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=1208.6000000000001s)]
*  because they weren't global before. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=1212.84s)]
*  I see. [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=1214.04s)]
*  So I wonder if we can show America alone because this says globally Netflix has 270 million [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=1215.04s)]
*  and Hulu has 50 million. [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=1220.64s)]
*  But if 50 is only in the U S right, that's only U S only. [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=1222.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=1225.88s)]
*  Netflix has got to be around 50 to 70 or who knows 80 in the, in the U S but, but anyway, [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=1226.88s)]
*  yeah, man, I'm doing that. [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=1230.72s)]
*  I'm touring all fall to go gear up for that. [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=1231.72s)]
*  All fall I'll be running around, which I'm excited to do. [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=1233.84s)]

*  I think about that all the time. [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=1255.24s)]
*  It's like, man, I kind of don't have the two great elements that people love here the most. [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=1256.3600000000001s)]
*  Why wouldn't you golf? [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=1260.8s)]
*  You think you could? [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=1261.8s)]
*  I think I could. [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=1262.8s)]
*  You're athletic. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=1263.8s)]
*  Yeah, I should probably spend a little more time doing it. [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=1264.8s)]
*  I don't want to go out. [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=1267.84s)]
*  I've been out there and it's not good and I don't want to go out there again and waste [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=1268.84s)]
*  people's time because people are a little more serious about it there. [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=1273.64s)]
*  Well, see, I'm good at golf, but I don't give a shit how good people are that I play. [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=1275.8s)]

*  Honestly, man, it was a dream come true for me. [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=1305.84s)]
*  Like as a kid, those are like, you always want to play the courses the pros get to play. [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=1310.04s)]

*  You definitely, you need minorities. [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=1339.8s)]
*  You have to get people with melanin to get good flavor and spices. [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=1342.28s)]

*  Like to fish. [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=2290.64s)]

*  And then when they're done enjoying your house, then you get to come back. [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=2301.68s)]

*  Yeah, pissing in your house. [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=2307.72s)]

*  And have you been a Dead fan? [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=2379.3199999999997s)]
*  Do you like the Dead? [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=2380.3199999999997s)]

*  I probably know like six or seven other songs probably, right? [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=2382.3199999999997s)]
*  So you like them. [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=2386.08s)]
*  Yeah, I like them. [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=2387.08s)]
*  My brother is a huge Grateful Dead fan, but he didn't want to maybe see Dead and Co. because [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=2388.64s)]
*  he didn't want to spoil like, you know, he's like Jerry. [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=2394.72s)]
*  He was, yeah, he liked Jerry. [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=2399.12s)]
*  Right. [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=2401.12s)]
*  And so, but he wanted to go. [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=2402.12s)]
*  He lives in, by Mount Zion. [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=2403.88s)]
*  So we met over there and I wanted to go and we wanted to do something together. [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=2405.52s)]
*  And yeah, I think I love that they have so much art. [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=2409.12s)]
*  There's so many little things you know about the Grateful Dead that since they have a lot [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=2414.0s)]
*  of cool and unique art and stuff, they're able to make a lot of neat stuff to put into [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=2419.12s)]
*  the visuals, right? [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=2423.24s)]
*  Whereas if you were a band, if you're like, you know, Guar maybe or something or Sinead [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=2424.92s)]
*  O'Connor, Jojo Siwa or somebody, you're not, I don't know if you're going to be able to [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=2432.92s)]
*  fill that space with enough intrigue, you know? [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=2442.7200000000003s)]
*  And history. [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=2446.36s)]
*  And history, right. [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=2447.36s)]
*  Right. [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=2448.36s)]
*  You almost need something that's a bit historical maybe or something that's extremely artistic. [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=2449.36s)]
*  Like a group that has a lot of ambiance that comes with it. [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=2454.76s)]
*  Right, you can't do, a solo artist would be a little hard there unless they have such [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=2457.6000000000004s)]
*  a rich story to tell. [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=2462.76s)]
*  Right, like a Michael Buble or something, you know, I don't know, but if it were just [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=2463.96s)]
*  Christmas and they were able to make really cool Christmas shit in there, then that's [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=2466.88s)]
*  a way to do it. [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=2469.92s)]
*  Yeah, maybe. [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=2470.92s)]
*  Yeah, Buble at Christmas would be nice though. [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=2471.92s)]
*  He is really talented, that guy. [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=2472.92s)]
*  People love him at Christmas. [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=2473.92s)]
*  No, I think. [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=2474.92s)]
*  Rest of the year, whatever. [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=2475.92s)]
*  Well, yeah, no, I don't need him. [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=2476.92s)]
*  I don't, I don't really don't need him. [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=2477.92s)]
*  Yeah, Buble later, dude. [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=2479.92s)]
*  That's pretty bad. [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=2481.08s)]
*  But what else did I think? [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=2482.52s)]
*  I thought it was amazing how like, well, there's like these things in the seats called like [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=2483.84s)]
*  haptics or whatever. [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=2488.12s)]
*  And so sometimes your seat will move, right? [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=2489.12s)]
*  So some of the seats, I think like 10,000 of the seats. [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=2491.28s)]
*  They have haptics. [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=2494.28s)]
*  Right. [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=2495.28s)]
*  And they, you know, so they'll have like a reaction or so that's kind of crazy. [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=2496.28s)]
*  I thought it was interesting how sometimes when you get there right in the beginning [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=2500.8s)]
*  and it just looks like a futuristic like kind of cage or something you're in. [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=2506.88s)]
*  Yeah, like a back, like a inner workings of a machine. [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=2513.48s)]
*  Yeah, it's not just like you're looking at a screen. [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=2517.0s)]
*  It looks like robot guts. [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=2519.0s)]
*  Yeah, or like inside of a video game. [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=2521.6800000000003s)]
*  Yeah, some like video game you went into like a space world or something. [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=2523.6800000000003s)]
*  And then it all kind of starts to happen and they don't give you everything at once. [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=2527.08s)]
*  They don't show you all their tricks at once. [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=2532.08s)]
*  No, they roll it out slow. [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=2534.7599999999998s)]
*  That's a great shot. [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=2535.7599999999998s)]
*  Wow. [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=2536.7599999999998s)]
*  That was you too, probably. [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=2537.7599999999998s)]
*  I bet. [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=2538.7599999999998s)]
*  Because that wasn't that what's wild about it is they give it so much dimension, you [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=2539.7599999999998s)]
*  know, through through through tricks of the LEDs. [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=2545.7599999999998s)]
*  And it really is kind of mind boggling. [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=2550.7599999999998s)]
*  Gets people. [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=2552.7599999999998s)]
*  I guess people get really dizzy. [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=2553.7599999999998s)]
*  Like some people get they have to take them out of there because they get so dizzy from [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=2554.7599999999998s)]
*  the movement because the movement is crazy. [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=2557.7599999999998s)]
*  It physically like it moves so heavily that I think people get disoriented. [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=2561.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=2566.44s)]
*  Oh, there's times where like the way that they do you're like you feel like the whole [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=2567.44s)]
*  thing is moving through space or time like you're the entire venue. [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=2571.44s)]
*  It feels like you're moving with it. [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=2576.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=2577.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=2578.44s)]
*  I think they said people with like kind of like like same thing with strobes, like people [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=2579.44s)]
*  that have heart problems or high blood pressure, epileptics or something. [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=2583.44s)]
*  Epileptics or if you're French Canadian, you're not supposed to go there. [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=2586.44s)]
*  Because it's dangerous for those kind of people, you know, and that's it's just a historical [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=2590.12s)]
*  unfortunate truth. [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=2595.12s)]
*  You get they get sick easier. [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=2596.12s)]

*  But it was a beautiful time, man. [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=2599.12s)]
*  It was a beautiful time. [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=2601.12s)]
*  I enjoyed it so much. [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=2602.12s)]
*  And it was long and like you really kind of get a story and I loved it. [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=2603.12s)]
*  And I thought what was really cool, too, with the great at the dead show was like if you [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=2608.12s)]
*  went down to the street, if you went down to the stage where the stage is and if there [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=2611.12s)]
*  was nothing on the bat and nothing on the screen, the stage only had a few lights on [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=2618.7999999999997s)]
*  it. [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=2624.6s)]
*  It literally looked like you were at a backyard concert. [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=2625.6s)]
*  Yeah, it's really crazy. [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=2626.6s)]
*  It's like it's so minimalistic and then so grand at the exact same time. [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=2627.6s)]
*  I mean, the stage, it had like five lights behind the guys or six, like I mean small [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=2632.4s)]
*  lights. [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=2639.4s)]
*  And then that's you too. [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=2640.4s)]
*  That's you too. [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=2643.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=2644.4s)]
*  And then it had a very and so if the screen was off, it literally look at you at a backyard [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=2646.1800000000003s)]
*  show. [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=2651.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=2652.5s)]
*  Like somebody's like a band was playing in somebody's backyard. [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=2653.5s)]
*  But yeah, I would totally recommend it. [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=2656.5s)]
*  I heard somebody refer to themselves as a sphere head after the like I'll never see [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=2658.58s)]
*  a show anywhere else. [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=2662.8s)]
*  Now I'm a sphere head. [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=2663.8s)]
*  It's pretty limiting. [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=2664.8s)]
*  Yeah, definitely limiting. [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=2665.8s)]
*  But it was interesting. [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=2666.8s)]
*  I'd never heard like I never thought like I'll only see a show at a certain venue. [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=2667.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=2672.8s)]
*  Dedicating to a venue is tough. [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=2673.8s)]
*  Because you're only going to get what you're going to get. [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=2675.7400000000002s)]
*  But I mean, you know, that's kind of life, isn't it? [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=2677.54s)]
*  You're going to get what you're going to get. [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=2679.54s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=2680.54s)]
*  So if you become a sphere head, you might as well soak it up. [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=2681.54s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=2683.54s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=2684.54s)]

*  She got a little out of control. [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=2783.36s)]
*  Being too much for France, by the way, because they're they're all whores. [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=2786.36s)]

*  something fell off of another planet. [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=2841.14s)]

*  And landed here. [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=2845.52s)]

*  Yeah, it does. [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=2849.36s)]
*  And walking up to it feels kind of daunting. [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=2850.38s)]
*  It feels very like a Millennium Falcon, like it's this big, daunting, intricate. [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=2852.6600000000003s)]

*  It feels foreign. [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=2861.82s)]
*  And I don't I don't mean that in a bad way. [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=2862.82s)]
*  I don't mean that in a negative way. [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=2863.94s)]
*  Yeah, because I know the word foreign people are really taken to heart these days. [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=2866.06s)]
*  Most sexually active cities in the world. [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=2869.26s)]
*  What I tell you, Paris, baby. [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=2870.38s)]

*  But to think though, right, so they secure a perimeter. [[00:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=3430.5s)]
*  Imagine seeing, okay, you have a 20-year-old. [[00:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUDxWAG3rU&t=3433.6600000000003s)]
