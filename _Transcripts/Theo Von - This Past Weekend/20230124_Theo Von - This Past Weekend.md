*  I just feel like they're like getting you ready for, I don't know. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtvycG7wxJ8&t=99.0s)]
*  I feel like somebody's just packaging you up in some, like a formatted. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtvycG7wxJ8&t=106.0s)]
*  I feel like I'm being formatted. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtvycG7wxJ8&t=113.0s)]
*  You ever formatted a document or something on Microsoft Word and you got the document how you want it. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtvycG7wxJ8&t=114.0s)]
*  You did as much as you could. You got a couple extra commas in there. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtvycG7wxJ8&t=122.0s)]
*  If you like me, you, I, you dude, I unlimited commas, bro. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtvycG7wxJ8&t=127.0s)]
*  Oh, I do unlimited commas. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtvycG7wxJ8&t=132.0s)]
*  Tiffany, comma, Ben, comma, fucking the comma neighbor. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtvycG7wxJ8&t=135.0s)]
*  All caps, unlimited commas, bro. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtvycG7wxJ8&t=145.0s)]
*  But then you do formatting and it puts it into nor, you know, regular whatever. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtvycG7wxJ8&t=149.0s)]
*  So the teacher can grade it. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtvycG7wxJ8&t=156.0s)]
*  And you give it to the teacher and like, this is a history report. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtvycG7wxJ8&t=159.0s)]
*  What does this have to do with anything? [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtvycG7wxJ8&t=162.0s)]
*  And I'm like, well, that's that's history, baby. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtvycG7wxJ8&t=164.0s)]
*  Tiffany been fucking a neighbor. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtvycG7wxJ8&t=169.0s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? That's history, boo. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtvycG7wxJ8&t=171.0s)]
*  That's in the books. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtvycG7wxJ8&t=174.0s)]
*  That's in God's library now, son, because she did it. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtvycG7wxJ8&t=176.0s)]
*  She did it. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtvycG7wxJ8&t=181.0s)]
*  So anyway, I'm in a button up. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtvycG7wxJ8&t=185.0s)]
*  And for me, that's a lot, you know, I, you know, and also I never liked it because when I was young, all the rich kids, they wore button ups. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtvycG7wxJ8&t=190.0s)]
*  They had the buttons and and it was buttoned up and damn, they just, you know, their lives looked buttoned up. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtvycG7wxJ8&t=198.0s)]
*  And I didn't like them. I just didn't like it. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtvycG7wxJ8&t=210.0s)]
*  I didn't like it. It resembled something I didn't like. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtvycG7wxJ8&t=212.0s)]
*  I think in some ways, organization or so, I don't know, but something about it just always made me feel uncomfortable. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtvycG7wxJ8&t=218.0s)]
*  But that's old shit. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtvycG7wxJ8&t=226.0s)]
*  And today I'm doing it. I'm wearing it. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtvycG7wxJ8&t=229.0s)]
*  I'm buttoned up for you today and with you today. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtvycG7wxJ8&t=231.0s)]
*  And I'm grateful. I'm excited to be here, you know, I'm excited to be here. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtvycG7wxJ8&t=238.0s)]
*  A lot of interesting stuff just been going on in my life and in your life. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtvycG7wxJ8&t=244.0s)]
*  And I want to hear about some of it and and and talk about some of it and share, you know. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtvycG7wxJ8&t=249.0s)]
*  But I feel a little formatted. I feel like, you know, this button up got me feeling. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtvycG7wxJ8&t=257.0s)]
*  You know, just damn caged up. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtvycG7wxJ8&t=264.0s)]
*  I don't know what I'm talking about. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtvycG7wxJ8&t=268.0s)]
*  And I never have, baby. I'm happy to be here with you today. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtvycG7wxJ8&t=271.0s)]

*  Hear a voice calling you. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtvycG7wxJ8&t=339.0s)]
*  It's the rising sun shining in the dark. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtvycG7wxJ8&t=344.0s)]
*  It's not. Can't you see? [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtvycG7wxJ8&t=349.0s)]

*  There's something about that that always. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtvycG7wxJ8&t=378.0s)]
*  Because it's hard to see a lot of times, man. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtvycG7wxJ8&t=381.0s)]

*  It's hard to see that possibility. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtvycG7wxJ8&t=387.0s)]

*  up on the wishing well circuit and they had a lot of people. Our town was, you know, semi-famous for [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtvycG7wxJ8&t=708.28s)]
*  the number of wishing wells that had in it. So you'd see people rolling through town just damn, [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtvycG7wxJ8&t=715.72s)]

*  And if you're not familiar with a wishing well, a wishing well is basically, it's like a, [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtvycG7wxJ8&t=747.96s)]
*  it's a, it's like a place you go to wish for something that you want. And I don't know how [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtvycG7wxJ8&t=755.96s)]
*  it started. I mean, I think, I guess a wishing well, somebody just, somebody dropped their money [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtvycG7wxJ8&t=764.44s)]
*  into a hole in the ground and just wish they hadn't. And I think that's the thing. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtvycG7wxJ8&t=769.32s)]
*  I mean, there's no other way for that to have had, you know, and then they probably felt so ashamed. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtvycG7wxJ8&t=778.36s)]
*  They, they just built a thing around it and just said, Hey, everybody come do this shit. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtvycG7wxJ8&t=783.96s)]

*  I think you can relate some with this feral child, this young man who something was uncomfortable [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtvycG7wxJ8&t=1524.0400000000002s)]

*  very real. So I'm gonna have to talk with a talk with an attorney, I got a buddy over there at [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtvycG7wxJ8&t=1569.8799999999999s)]

*  I don't know if that's the word. If you know, it was like, [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtvycG7wxJ8&t=1609.0s)]
*  I don't know, it's interesting when you're trying to date or whatever. And then you kind of put [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtvycG7wxJ8&t=1614.9199999999998s)]

*  let's get in. Let's do it. And then you and somebody's got to put that left foot in first, [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtvycG7wxJ8&t=1643.72s)]
*  usually. And I put that bitch in, dog. And then it was just both of my feet and just one of her [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtvycG7wxJ8&t=1649.96s)]

*  And then you're just standing there by yourself. You know, you're on your own two feet. So that's [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtvycG7wxJ8&t=1679.4s)]
*  good. But and you're in a new place, you're in like a little bit of a braver place because you [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtvycG7wxJ8&t=1684.28s)]
*  went there a little. But yeah, I think that shit, you know, I think it's always been tough for me to [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtvycG7wxJ8&t=1688.28s)]
*  tell somebody if I tell somebody I like it. I think it's always been tough for me to tell somebody if [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtvycG7wxJ8&t=1698.28s)]
*  I tell somebody I like them. That's always been tough for me. You know, I don't want to tell you [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtvycG7wxJ8&t=1702.68s)]
*  that. I don't want to. It just man, there's a part inside of me. It's not even me. It's something [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtvycG7wxJ8&t=1708.68s)]
*  deep inside of me that feels very scared to say, very scared to say I like you. I think it's to a [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtvycG7wxJ8&t=1713.3200000000002s)]

*  So I don't have a lot of self-pity about it. I'm not trying to whine about it. I'm just trying to [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtvycG7wxJ8&t=1741.4s)]
*  share what's going on in my life and things that are just things that are just normal. [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtvycG7wxJ8&t=1745.64s)]
*  You know, but yeah, there's something I talked about it a little bit on the Louie episode. And [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtvycG7wxJ8&t=1756.6000000000001s)]

*  I texted him a few days after, because there was one thing he said in a video, there was a lot of [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtvycG7wxJ8&t=1861.56s)]
*  stuff he said in a weird way. I wish I'd tried to, you know, he said some things, like he said one [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtvycG7wxJ8&t=1869.8s)]
*  thing. He said, you can't be a pedophile if you're a child. [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtvycG7wxJ8&t=1881.0s)]
*  Which was interesting, like, and I'd never realized that I, in my life, I needed to, [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtvycG7wxJ8&t=1892.76s)]
*  I, when I was young, there's funny, you know, I don't want to say funny, but there's things that [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtvycG7wxJ8&t=1898.28s)]
*  happen with kids where you, you know, people see each other's wieners or booties or whatever, you're, [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtvycG7wxJ8&t=1903.56s)]
*  you know, you, people, you know, you're humping your pillows and, you know, like, Louis was talking [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtvycG7wxJ8&t=1910.7600000000002s)]
*  about telling Juicers, him and his buddy at like summer camp, and there's things that happen, you [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtvycG7wxJ8&t=1916.8400000000001s)]
*  know, where, you know, I had some moments when I was a kid when I would just hug my sister so hard, [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtvycG7wxJ8&t=1922.2800000000002s)]
*  like she was a doll, and I think I felt a lot of shame about that. And I'd never had a man, [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtvycG7wxJ8&t=1928.7600000000002s)]
*  I'd never had a man say, hey, you're not, this is, none of this makes you a bad person. I'd never had [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtvycG7wxJ8&t=1937.64s)]
*  any, that ever happened in my life. So it was interesting that even just sitting there talking [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtvycG7wxJ8&t=1945.72s)]
*  with him when he said that, it kind of, it's, I needed that. I needed in my life to hear [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtvycG7wxJ8&t=1950.5200000000002s)]
*  a man, you know, who's older than me, I don't know how old Louis is, but I think he's, he could be my [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtvycG7wxJ8&t=1959.96s)]
*  dad if he were, had had me at a young age, and I needed, or I just needed to hear someone I had [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtvycG7wxJ8&t=1965.16s)]
*  looked up to in certain aspects, you know, I don't know all the aspects of his life, but someone that [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtvycG7wxJ8&t=1973.88s)]
*  I had some admiration for, I needed to hear them say something like that, and I just didn't realize [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtvycG7wxJ8&t=1980.2s)]
*  it. And sometimes you don't know where those pieces of life hit you at. You don't know who has, [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtvycG7wxJ8&t=1986.1200000000001s)]
*  anybody could be, could say something that you needed your father to say, or you needed your mother [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtvycG7wxJ8&t=1993.0s)]
*  to say. So that was interesting to me, and I texted him, and I said, hey, you know, I just wanted to [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtvycG7wxJ8&t=1999.16s)]
*  say thanks. There was this thing you said that I had needed to hear in most of my life, and I had [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtvycG7wxJ8&t=2006.6000000000001s)]
*  never heard it, because I'd had a lot of shame about things, even just about, you know, I think [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtvycG7wxJ8&t=2012.28s)]
*  is, you have shame about masturbating and, you know, spraying out and everything, and, you know, [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtvycG7wxJ8&t=2017.48s)]
*  and my dad had just had, you know, he didn't engage with me about any of that or talk about it, [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtvycG7wxJ8&t=2027.0s)]
*  you know. He had me bury damn half of a Smurfs bed sheet in the yard, and [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtvycG7wxJ8&t=2033.56s)]
*  and it was just always very uncomfortable. So to even have little moments like that, [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtvycG7wxJ8&t=2041.32s)]
*  but I think I just found some connection in that call with him, [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtvycG7wxJ8&t=2048.36s)]
*  just hearing a voice that's knowledgeable, but not, he wasn't judgmental. [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtvycG7wxJ8&t=2053.56s)]
*  Obviously, he's been through all the nooks and crannies of, you know, sexual discussion and [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtvycG7wxJ8&t=2060.84s)]
*  thought probably in his own head. And so, yeah, just to have like an adult say that, [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtvycG7wxJ8&t=2068.6s)]
*  don't, you know, that you can't be, you're not bad for, it was, I don't know, it was kind of blanket, [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtvycG7wxJ8&t=2074.76s)]
*  but it just hit me and I needed to hear that, and I never knew I did. So anyway, there were moments [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtvycG7wxJ8&t=2082.92s)]
*  like that. Anyway, sorry to interrupt your call so much. Let's go onward. And the reason for that is [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtvycG7wxJ8&t=2089.96s)]
*  just because you put yourself out here and you make yourself vulnerable, and there's a lot of [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtvycG7wxJ8&t=2095.0s)]

*  you know, I'm a late bloomer, man. I know I am. And that's okay. You know, [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtvycG7wxJ8&t=2177.64s)]
*  if you go through a toll childhood of not getting to have interaction or to talk or have any idea [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtvycG7wxJ8&t=2184.2s)]
*  what your feelings are or help somebody mold what feeling even is, and you're just surviving in the [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtvycG7wxJ8&t=2190.52s)]
*  fucking world. And then at some point you start to quit trying to survive. [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtvycG7wxJ8&t=2199.72s)]
*  Then you, I, you still have a whole, I still have a whole, [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtvycG7wxJ8&t=2209.24s)]
*  I still have a whole roll of decks of shit that I didn't get to get right [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtvycG7wxJ8&t=2215.3199999999997s)]
*  or I never got to even get wrong. Um, [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtvycG7wxJ8&t=2219.64s)]
*  yeah, I don't know, man. Some of that shit makes me fucking, you know, and some of it still makes [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtvycG7wxJ8&t=2229.72s)]
*  me angry. So now there's a lot of, I mean, I got so much, I got a lot of anger in me sometimes. [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtvycG7wxJ8&t=2233.24s)]
*  And people say, forgive and forget. I get that I'm in a program doing all that shit, [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtvycG7wxJ8&t=2238.7599999999998s)]
*  but that you just, cause you say you forgive. Doesn't mean that something just disappears. [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtvycG7wxJ8&t=2246.2s)]
*  You know, um, [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtvycG7wxJ8&t=2252.4399999999996s)]
*  cause some of this shit, man, it fucking lives in me. [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtvycG7wxJ8&t=2256.2s)]
*  You know, sometimes there's still a kid inside of me that's so fucking angry, bro. [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtvycG7wxJ8&t=2261.16s)]
*  You know, and it's my job as an adult, just to not, not to let him drive the boat. You know, um, [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtvycG7wxJ8&t=2267.96s)]
*  anyway, I'm not trying to get into self pity, but there was just a lot during that, that [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtvycG7wxJ8&t=2272.7599999999998s)]
*  conversation. You know, it's like, I'm still collecting, [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtvycG7wxJ8&t=2278.12s)]
*  I'm still collecting [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtvycG7wxJ8&t=2285.64s)]
*  conversations that should have happened when I was a kid. [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtvycG7wxJ8&t=2289.3199999999997s)]
*  And I'm out here, you know, [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtvycG7wxJ8&t=2293.96s)]
*  trying to collect them as an adult, um, [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtvycG7wxJ8&t=2298.2799999999997s)]
*  and not even collect them. I'm trying to, I just don't know where they're going to happen. [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtvycG7wxJ8&t=2303.3199999999997s)]
*  And sometimes I don't know that they are going to happen. It just, one thing you could do, [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtvycG7wxJ8&t=2307.56s)]
*  you know, so I'm just grateful that God lets me be alive and that gives me an opportunity to [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtvycG7wxJ8&t=2310.8399999999997s)]
*  have some experiences, but thank you for the call, dude. I was excited. Um, I felt like we had a [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtvycG7wxJ8&t=2315.56s)]
*  good connection. I didn't know I was scared. I'd seen Louie one time in the hall at the comedy [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtvycG7wxJ8&t=2321.7999999999997s)]
*  store when he was very famous in mainstream media. And, um, you know, I, I, he seemed very [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtvycG7wxJ8&t=2328.2799999999997s)]
*  standoffish. He seemed like a fancy guy. And, uh, but I also didn't know him, but, um, he didn't [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtvycG7wxJ8&t=2334.2799999999997s)]
*  seem like approachable or anything. But, uh, but I, I, I felt, I felt excited to get invited to his [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtvycG7wxJ8&t=2341.72s)]
*  show. I hadn't gone to a comedy show in a long time. I was like, I'm going to go to a comedy [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtvycG7wxJ8&t=2348.04s)]
*  show. And, uh, I'd been like the first comedy show I'd ever been to. And then I'd been to, [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtvycG7wxJ8&t=2354.6s)]
*  I went to see Bob Newhart one time in Chicago. And then I saw Louie of actual show where I went [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtvycG7wxJ8&t=2362.6s)]
*  and went and just sat in the audience and watched. I've seen a ton of sets at the comedy store and [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtvycG7wxJ8&t=2370.2799999999997s)]
*  that, but anyway, this is getting a little bit long here. So, but I'm excited to be able to [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtvycG7wxJ8&t=2374.12s)]
*  So, but anyway, this is getting a little bit long here. So, [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtvycG7wxJ8&t=2380.76s)]
*  all right, let's get into a little bit of news here and then we'll go on to the, uh, [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtvycG7wxJ8&t=2385.0800000000004s)]
*  I'll tell you about the fashion show. What happened here? Uh, in the news, we got, um, [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtvycG7wxJ8&t=2389.0s)]
*  Alabama woman who joined ISIS once back in the U S. Nope. Bye, bitch. That's what I'm saying. [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtvycG7wxJ8&t=2397.88s)]
*  A woman who left Alabama, joined the Islamic state in 2014. Now says she regrets her action [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtvycG7wxJ8&t=2410.28s)]
*  and is hoping to return to the United States. If I need to sit in prison and do my time, [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtvycG7wxJ8&t=2415.1600000000003s)]
*  I will do it. I won't fight against it. Oh, now that's interesting. [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtvycG7wxJ8&t=2419.96s)]
*  I can, that could be fair, but I don't know. You know, I, I get to, it gets to a point where [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtvycG7wxJ8&t=2425.0s)]
*  as a country, you make so many bends of whatever your original rules are that you're not a country [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtvycG7wxJ8&t=2431.6400000000003s)]
*  anymore. You know, if you have like at the pool rules, say you have the pool rules and these are [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtvycG7wxJ8&t=2439.08s)]
*  the rules, you can't swim during this hours. You can't, uh, no swim in 30 minutes after sandwiches [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtvycG7wxJ8&t=2446.2s)]
*  or dining, no diarrhea's no, uh, pissing in a pool or whatever. So you have those rules, but then you [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtvycG7wxJ8&t=2455.08s)]
*  start breaking all the rules. I'm gonna change this rule, change this rule, change this rule. [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtvycG7wxJ8&t=2468.12s)]
*  And then you have somebody that comes up and this lady, whatever, just sprayed tit milk on the rules [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtvycG7wxJ8&t=2472.2799999999997s)]
*  and went off to another country to join a group that was against your original country. [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtvycG7wxJ8&t=2481.24s)]
*  I say bye. I say bye, man, because you changed it. Then there's no more rules. Then this pool [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtvycG7wxJ8&t=2488.3599999999997s)]
*  doesn't exist. Now you got people eating out of the pool, making soup. You got one dude, [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtvycG7wxJ8&t=2494.76s)]
*  diarrhea and down here by the ladder. The ducks have fecal alcohol syndrome from the, uh, duties [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtvycG7wxJ8&t=2500.28s)]
*  at the other end. And then somebody selling duck, you got a Chinese dude selling duck meat on the [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtvycG7wxJ8&t=2508.44s)]
*  side of the pool. You know, you got some fellow over there just huffing down duck empanadas and he [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtvycG7wxJ8&t=2513.7200000000003s)]
*  gets infected because of the guy by the ladder. Just the whole thing, but it's all because the [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtvycG7wxJ8&t=2519.1600000000003s)]
*  rules keep getting adjusted. So I say, no, you left. You said, fuck this place. Then that you [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtvycG7wxJ8&t=2523.96s)]
*  made your go pick another place. Then if ISIS didn't work out, you didn't cut it in ISIS. [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtvycG7wxJ8&t=2534.36s)]
*  All right, go play back, play hoops in Russia, boo. And some of my reasoning behind what the rules [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtvycG7wxJ8&t=2542.2s)]
*  is because at a certain point that people that care about that, like going to the pool in the [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtvycG7wxJ8&t=2547.64s)]
*  beginning, they're not going to want to be at the pool anymore. [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtvycG7wxJ8&t=2551.72s)]
*  They're going to, they're not going to, nobody's going to want to be at the pool. [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtvycG7wxJ8&t=2557.48s)]
*  So now you made all these adjustments about the pool [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtvycG7wxJ8&t=2561.8799999999997s)]
*  and you don't have a pool anymore. Now you got a duck soup, diarrhea farm. That's what you got. [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtvycG7wxJ8&t=2567.24s)]
*  And the people that originally cared about the pool that made it the pool, [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtvycG7wxJ8&t=2577.7999999999997s)]
*  they're not going to care anymore. They're going to find some other place. They're going to get [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtvycG7wxJ8&t=2582.3599999999997s)]
*  into private areas and have their own pool. They're going to figure it out. [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtvycG7wxJ8&t=2586.7599999999998s)]
*  So, I don't know. I just liked it better when, and maybe it's just me and this is just my [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtvycG7wxJ8&t=2592.2s)]
*  perspective, but when it felt like we all, we all had the same pool in mind. [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtvycG7wxJ8&t=2598.04s)]
*  What else? Parents in shock as gorillas mate in front of kids at zoo. [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtvycG7wxJ8&t=2612.2s)]
*  A pair of gorillas at a zoo left parents shocked as they decided to start doing it like they do [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtvycG7wxJ8&t=2618.6s)]
*  on the Discovery Channel, right in front of the kids. When you take the kids to the zoo to see all [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtvycG7wxJ8&t=2626.04s)]
*  the wonders of the animal kingdom, you've always got to understand there's a risk that all creatures, [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtvycG7wxJ8&t=2631.16s)]
*  great and small, will be up to some naughty antics. I love this. Hell, I think the zoo could [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtvycG7wxJ8&t=2635.64s)]
*  charge more for animal sex hours, honestly. If you come at 2 p.m., that's when everybody's fucking. [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtvycG7wxJ8&t=2643.08s)]
*  You know what I'm saying, bro? Because you go to some of these cages now, you go to the lion cage. [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtvycG7wxJ8&t=2651.3199999999997s)]
*  He's in there. He's always sleeping or he's laid out or he's on, looks like he's on a couple [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtvycG7wxJ8&t=2656.8399999999997s)]
*  zanies, you know? They always got a kickball next to him. Who's ever seen a lion play kickball? [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtvycG7wxJ8&t=2661.8s)]
*  What fucking lion gets up and he's like, roar. Then you see another lion run up and just, [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtvycG7wxJ8&t=2671.7200000000003s)]
*  and the other lions are like, roar, kick it, kick it. It's, there's no, that's, what do they do? [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtvycG7wxJ8&t=2681.4s)]
*  They're not doing anything. And then, and there's always like a tightrope in the cage going from [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtvycG7wxJ8&t=2687.64s)]
*  like one tree to another. Like the lion, like the lion's just going to like, oh, just like walk on [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtvycG7wxJ8&t=2692.7599999999998s)]
*  the road. Oh, I'm a rope lion. I'm a tightrope lion. Roar. Fuck, what the fuck? They don't do [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtvycG7wxJ8&t=2698.44s)]
*  shit, man. I'm sick of paying entry fees to see animals not do shit. They don't do shit. [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtvycG7wxJ8&t=2710.52s)]
*  These animals don't do shit. They just lay there like rich animals. That's all they are [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtvycG7wxJ8&t=2719.88s)]
*  because we took them out of the wild. The wild is where God is out there setting it off [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtvycG7wxJ8&t=2725.64s)]
*  and mother nature's out there fucking twerking and people are eating BBQ and getting gunned down. [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtvycG7wxJ8&t=2734.44s)]
*  But we take them out of the natural environment. We put them in this rich ass fucking maximum or [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtvycG7wxJ8&t=2741.0s)]
*  minimum security prison and they're living large. They're kickballing. They're eating lamb. [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtvycG7wxJ8&t=2746.28s)]
*  They're, I saw one video, they're feeding lamb to lambs. [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtvycG7wxJ8&t=2754.52s)]
*  I'm sick of these rich ass animals. That's all this is, man. Have you ever lived in a shitty [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtvycG7wxJ8&t=2761.2400000000002s)]
*  neighborhood and then moved to a better neighborhood? Have you ever moved from Memphis to Nashville? [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtvycG7wxJ8&t=2767.24s)]
*  Okay, that's what's happening with these animals and people are like, well, we got to set the animals [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtvycG7wxJ8&t=2774.68s)]
*  free. No, we what if we set the animals free, every penguin will be at Albertsons in the frozen food [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtvycG7wxJ8&t=2781.4799999999996s)]
*  section. You'll have every penguin in there fucking just just beating open a thing of fish sticks. [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtvycG7wxJ8&t=2791.48s)]
*  Every leopard will kill every missing pet in your area. There will be zero missing animals. [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtvycG7wxJ8&t=2800.44s)]
*  You can't free these animals, man, because they'll be right back in nature. They'll be right back in [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtvycG7wxJ8&t=2811.08s)]
*  the wild. In the wild, the wild is gangster. That's the UFC for animals, man. These animals, [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtvycG7wxJ8&t=2817.4s)]
*  they have it good in the zoo. They got it really really good. So I say we either put them to work [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtvycG7wxJ8&t=2825.4s)]
*  or tell them to take a four-legged hike. I want to go to the zoo and they got, I want to go during, [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtvycG7wxJ8&t=2832.12s)]

*  And you know, I don't like the French. You know it. If you had to pick six things I don't like, [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtvycG7wxJ8&t=3029.8s)]
*  the French would be four of them. [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtvycG7wxJ8&t=3034.76s)]
*  So I got invited. They were doing a comedy fashion show. This fella, Kid Super. [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtvycG7wxJ8&t=3041.6400000000003s)]

*  You know, you suddenly get those, you know, they got that 40 year old in a cape or something and [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtvycG7wxJ8&t=3051.4s)]
*  he's, you know, he wants to jump out of a window or whatever and they won't let him [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtvycG7wxJ8&t=3055.56s)]

*  But it wasn't. It was a fashion show put on by this fella, Colm Delane. [[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtvycG7wxJ8&t=3075.08s)]
*  Make sure I get his name correctly. Colm Delane. Yes. And a real beautiful fella, man. A really [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtvycG7wxJ8&t=3084.92s)]
*  kind, smart, neat guy. And I'd had a friend, Aaron Levy, that was a part of the John Elliott [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtvycG7wxJ8&t=3094.68s)]
*  clothing brand. So I'd been around some clothing, fashion, high fashion. And I don't know much about [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtvycG7wxJ8&t=3102.04s)]
*  fashion. You know that. I mean, look at me. There you go. And you know, I don't. And, you know, [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtvycG7wxJ8&t=3107.16s)]
*  I got three pairs of pants. I wear one of them all the time. This is it. These little camo deals, [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtvycG7wxJ8&t=3115.0s)]
*  it's paper thin, but they're nice from North Face and I like them. But anyway, we get invited to [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtvycG7wxJ8&t=3122.44s)]
*  this thing and they said it's going to be, I mean, you're wearing, I mean, some of the linen, [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtvycG7wxJ8&t=3128.92s)]

*  hot off the eight arms, baby. You know what I'm saying? This shit is fresh. And [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtvycG7wxJ8&t=3140.68s)]
*  so, yeah, we go, first of all, we get to the airport and they're taking us on a jet. I mean, [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtvycG7wxJ8&t=3147.08s)]
*  this thing, Puma put us on a jet. And it's, I mean, this thing was long. This thing had two [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtvycG7wxJ8&t=3151.8799999999997s)]
*  bathrooms in it. And I pissed in both of them because you know that, boy, if there's, I'm pissing [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtvycG7wxJ8&t=3158.84s)]
*  it. You know what I'm saying? I'm pissing at each end of the yard, baby. And I'll let the devil do [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtvycG7wxJ8&t=3166.28s)]
*  the laundry, baby. You know what I'm saying? I'm pissing when I get in something. That's always who [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtvycG7wxJ8&t=3172.6800000000003s)]
*  I've been. You know, as a child at night, before I go to bed, I'd piss off each side of my bed and [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtvycG7wxJ8&t=3176.92s)]
*  I'd piss around it. I'd stand on my bed and urinate around it just to keep, you know, whatever bad [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtvycG7wxJ8&t=3182.52s)]
*  stuff could come get me to keep it away. But anyway, so we went there. Who was there? Andrew [[00:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtvycG7wxJ8&t=3190.92s)]
*  Santino, Matteo Lane, other comedians, Stavros Halkias, Fari, and he's [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtvycG7wxJ8&t=3200.12s)]
*  French comedian. Who else? Jeff Ross, a couple of the comedians. Yeah, anyway, so we went out on the [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtvycG7wxJ8&t=3212.68s)]
*  stage and we had to walk in a fashion and we had to do the, you know, and do some material on stage. [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtvycG7wxJ8&t=3221.88s)]
*  So that was part of it. And it was just wild, you know, like there's, I mean, you know, I, [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtvycG7wxJ8&t=3231.32s)]
*  this was the most nervous that I'd been to do comedy in a long time because for one, [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtvycG7wxJ8&t=3238.28s)]
*  people are coming to judge, they judge clothing. I mean, this is like fancy people. This is like [[00:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtvycG7wxJ8&t=3247.2400000000002s)]
*  the fanciest people. Everybody has a blog. Everybody has a webpage. Everybody has a lawyer. [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtvycG7wxJ8&t=3252.04s)]
*  It's people like that, you know, and so you get, it's like, I knew these people were going to be, [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtvycG7wxJ8&t=3258.84s)]
*  are judgmental about clothes anyway. They're going to, they're, they're here to judge clothing all [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtvycG7wxJ8&t=3267.4s)]
*  week. So if you throw in an outlier, like a comedian who's coming in, who's not even part [[00:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtvycG7wxJ8&t=3271.0s)]
*  of their world, we're the easiest thing for them to hate on. Oh, I can hate on this guy. Oh, easy, [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtvycG7wxJ8&t=3277.4s)]
*  done. Comedian done. So I feel, I was like, oh, these are mafers, man. And it was rich people, [[00:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtvycG7wxJ8&t=3283.56s)]
*  bro. And I don't like the rich, man. I've said it and you know it. And people say, well, man, [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtvycG7wxJ8&t=3291.08s)]
*  you make money. And yeah, I do, but I'll never be rich. I'll never be fucking infected with that [[00:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtvycG7wxJ8&t=3299.24s)]
*  shit. That shit starts in your heart, son. So I don't know, I won't be like that. And I know, [[00:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtvycG7wxJ8&t=3306.92s)]
*  because when I get around rich people, I don't like them. And I just felt that in there, [[00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtvycG7wxJ8&t=3314.76s)]
*  just that age old energy, man. You know, cause they had a rich doctor when I was young, they had a [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtvycG7wxJ8&t=3322.12s)]
*  rich veterinarian, right? And he would, he would drive through our neighborhoods. Sometimes people [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtvycG7wxJ8&t=3328.36s)]
*  would cut through from the highway there and then they had another highway. And in between the two [[00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtvycG7wxJ8&t=3334.44s)]
*  highways was our neighborhood. And off of that, people would cut through our neighborhood and [[00:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtvycG7wxJ8&t=3340.28s)]
*  drive off to one of the, down one of the highways and be nice neighborhoods. And they had this [[00:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtvycG7wxJ8&t=3345.8s)]
*  veterinarian and he would throw animals, dead animals out in our ditch and shit when they drove by. [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtvycG7wxJ8&t=3350.68s)]
*  You know, and so that shit always stuck with me, man. You know, like, oh, this is just the place [[00:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtvycG7wxJ8&t=3357.72s)]
*  where they, that's what they think of this. That's what they think of us. This is just a place where [[00:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtvycG7wxJ8&t=3367.3199999999997s)]
*  we put dead animals. And you could damn use Clorox. You would never get that shit out of my system. [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtvycG7wxJ8&t=3374.52s)]
*  But anyway, and I know this is a judgmental play. People are judging fashion. People are here to be [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtvycG7wxJ8&t=3384.84s)]
*  judged. So I know the easiest thing for some blogger, which is basically just a job where you are [[00:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtvycG7wxJ8&t=3389.96s)]
*  afraid to fucking fight. The easiest job for a blogger is to say, to point fingers at the outlier [[00:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtvycG7wxJ8&t=3397.48s)]
*  that comes in to say, this is bad. Right. Instead of saying this is good from all the bribes or [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtvycG7wxJ8&t=3406.44s)]
*  whatever they get, I don't know, or whatever their end goal is. But anyway, to say this bad. So I just [[00:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtvycG7wxJ8&t=3416.6s)]
*  knew going up against it was going to be tough. And it turned out it was okay. And we did well. [[00:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtvycG7wxJ8&t=3422.76s)]
*  And yeah, the kids super clothing, you know, it's nice, neat stuff and calm. The guy who runs, [[00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtvycG7wxJ8&t=3429.3199999999997s)]
*  it was very neat. Andrew Schultz was there. That was fun to get to spend time with him. [[00:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtvycG7wxJ8&t=3436.2s)]
*  It was great, man. That was exciting. I went for a walk. [[00:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtvycG7wxJ8&t=3442.44s)]
*  I didn't try to do too much in France because I wasn't there long. [[00:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtvycG7wxJ8&t=3450.52s)]
*  And you get out in the streets and it's, you know, it's French. [[00:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtvycG7wxJ8&t=3454.12s)]
*  People are French and, you know, just fucking French and around, dog. [[00:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtvycG7wxJ8&t=3459.08s)]
*  But we got to go out at night. We went in. They had nice music at night and just the whole [[00:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtvycG7wxJ8&t=3463.2400000000002s)]
*  experience was fancy. And it actually ended up being a good experience. Sometimes I carry old [[00:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtvycG7wxJ8&t=3467.08s)]
*  ideas into things. And so I got to kind of monitor that. But my nerves are warnings for me. [[00:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtvycG7wxJ8&t=3473.32s)]
*  And they say, Hey, this is what's up. Beware of this. And, and I'm glad that they're there. [[00:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtvycG7wxJ8&t=3485.0800000000004s)]
*  Those are instincts too. Sometimes it's not nerves, it's instincts. And you got to really ask them, [[00:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtvycG7wxJ8&t=3492.36s)]
*  are you a nerve? Are you an instinct? Tell me. You got to figure it out. Okay. Let's get into a call [[00:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtvycG7wxJ8&t=3498.12s)]

*  But I'm happy to have her. I'm happy that she is a guest every week. And I'm happy to be a little part [[01:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtvycG7wxJ8&t=3745.24s)]

*  Hey, Theo. This is John from Minneapolis, Minnesota. [[01:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtvycG7wxJ8&t=3778.04s)]
*  What's up, John from Minneapolis. And sorry about what happened here, Vikings, but [[01:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtvycG7wxJ8&t=3781.72s)]

*  I've just been uplifted by it so much. I work for my dad and I [[01:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtvycG7wxJ8&t=3798.12s)]
*  listen to your podcast almost every single day. He owns a window cleaning business and was recently [[01:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtvycG7wxJ8&t=3805.3999999999996s)]
*  diagnosed with stage four brain cancer. So me and my brother have been having to kind of take over [[01:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtvycG7wxJ8&t=3811.24s)]
*  for him. And this has been a really tough time for my family. Anyways, I know you lost your father [[01:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtvycG7wxJ8&t=3817.3999999999996s)]
*  kind of young. I'm young myself, not as young as you were, but I'm only 21. And I'm just hoping you [[01:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtvycG7wxJ8&t=3827.24s)]
*  might have some advice for me on how to move forward through this time of life. Just finding it real hard. [[01:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtvycG7wxJ8&t=3834.8399999999997s)]
*  You know, I talked about this a little bit on the Louie episode where, you know, my dad had a [[01:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtvycG7wxJ8&t=3842.8399999999997s)]
*  girlfriend in his later years and we went over to her. I was over at her house one night and she had [[01:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtvycG7wxJ8&t=3849.7999999999997s)]
*  a nice house, man. And this is the, I don't know, I don't know if you remember, but I was [[01:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtvycG7wxJ8&t=3856.6s)]
*  it looked like a, it was like a big apart, like a condo. And I'd never been in a condo before and it [[01:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtvycG7wxJ8&t=3865.64s)]
*  had like big windows and she made these roast beef sandwiches and the roast beef was like in a pot [[01:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtvycG7wxJ8&t=3874.2799999999997s)]
*  and it had like sauce with it. And I'd never seen anything like it. You know, I just felt like I, [[01:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtvycG7wxJ8&t=3882.04s)]
*  I just felt like the meat itself had just drowned itself and [[01:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtvycG7wxJ8&t=3889.64s)]
*  and done it on purpose for me. It just was that good, you know. [[01:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtvycG7wxJ8&t=3896.52s)]
*  And I remember being over there one night and [[01:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtvycG7wxJ8&t=3901.64s)]
*  my dad had gotten, I didn't know that my dad was sick, right? And in the middle of the night, [[01:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtvycG7wxJ8&t=3909.7200000000003s)]
*  we would sleep out on the couch at her place because they didn't have, [[01:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtvycG7wxJ8&t=3915.24s)]
*  because my dad was sleeping in the extra, she had an extra room, my dad was sleeping there and then [[01:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtvycG7wxJ8&t=3919.72s)]
*  he slept on the couch. The couch was nice, boy. And my dad had got up in the middle of the night [[01:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtvycG7wxJ8&t=3923.08s)]
*  and he was going down the hall towards her room and I was awake. And I was like, what is he doing? [[01:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtvycG7wxJ8&t=3931.64s)]
*  Is he, you know, was my dad sexually active? I didn't know, you know, I didn't know what they [[01:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtvycG7wxJ8&t=3939.2400000000002s)]
*  were doing, you know, I knew it could, I just didn't know. And so I kind of went over there, [[01:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtvycG7wxJ8&t=3944.6800000000003s)]
*  you know, because I'm a pervert. And I went and I saw that my dad had like, [[01:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtvycG7wxJ8&t=3952.6800000000003s)]
*  he had like diarrhea himself. And [[01:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtvycG7wxJ8&t=3961.0s)]
*  and he was going to ask her, he was asking her for help, you know, and [[01:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtvycG7wxJ8&t=3971.08s)]
*  and yeah, it just, [[01:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtvycG7wxJ8&t=3981.56s)]
*  and like six weeks after that, he passed away. I mean, that was when I first found out that he was sick. [[01:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtvycG7wxJ8&t=3983.64s)]
*  And yeah, I think it was just such a moment of like, okay, here's this guy's, [[01:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtvycG7wxJ8&t=3999.3999999999996s)]
*  is this guy's, what is, is there sex going here or what? And then it's scary. It was just a lot of stuff, you know. [[01:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtvycG7wxJ8&t=4005.08s)]
*  So yeah, I can't, you know, I don't know what's going on in your world. And so I didn't mean to [[01:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtvycG7wxJ8&t=4018.2799999999997s)]
*  make that about me. It just, that made me think about that. And I just talked about it on that [[01:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtvycG7wxJ8&t=4021.4s)]
*  Louis episode a little bit. But just that it was just scary, you know, and I remember being scared. [[01:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtvycG7wxJ8&t=4025.3199999999997s)]
*  And you know, it's so neat that your dad has a business that you and your brother are working in. [[01:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtvycG7wxJ8&t=4036.04s)]
*  That's so cool. That's a piece of him, you know. [[01:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtvycG7wxJ8&t=4042.04s)]
*  That's a piece of him. That's things that we miss in the world is when our dads would do something [[01:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtvycG7wxJ8&t=4048.12s)]
*  and then the sons would carry it on. And it wasn't like, you know, before everything got all globalized and [[01:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtvycG7wxJ8&t=4051.88s)]
*  we sold out a lot of our values for [[01:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtvycG7wxJ8&t=4060.04s)]
*  the benefit of few, you know. And [[01:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtvycG7wxJ8&t=4065.16s)]
*  sorry, that was a little political there. But it was when they, you know, more mom and pop operations. [[01:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtvycG7wxJ8&t=4072.7599999999998s)]
*  Because with mom and pop come children and then the children become the mom and pop. And then [[01:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtvycG7wxJ8&t=4079.16s)]
*  there's something you created that carries on through you, you know. But [[01:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtvycG7wxJ8&t=4085.0s)]
*  it's beautiful you guys have that, you know. And sometimes if I want to think about my dad or feel what he feels like, you know, I [[01:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtvycG7wxJ8&t=4089.8s)]
*  I'll put my hand like on my heart. [[01:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtvycG7wxJ8&t=4104.92s)]
*  Because my heartbeat came from my dad, you know, and my mom. And so I'm a remix of my parents. [[01:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtvycG7wxJ8&t=4109.64s)]
*  And when I miss my dad, you know, this is the sound that he made. [[01:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtvycG7wxJ8&t=4115.88s)]
*  It's a sound that he made that was in him. Part of the sound that's inside of me, the beat that comes in me [[01:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtvycG7wxJ8&t=4125.16s)]
*  that stays alive was in my father. And the only place it is now it's in me, you know. [[01:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtvycG7wxJ8&t=4131.96s)]
*  It's in my siblings too, but part of it is in me. And that's his sound. That is his sound. [[01:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtvycG7wxJ8&t=4138.52s)]
*  And that gives me some solace sometimes. It gives me some solace sometimes. [[01:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtvycG7wxJ8&t=4145.88s)]
*  But I'm sorry you guys are doing that. I'm blessed. It's a blessing to have a brother there to go through it with you. [[01:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtvycG7wxJ8&t=4160.6s)]
*  And you're able, you have a relationship with your father. It sounds like you're going to be able to deal with some of this and process it. [[01:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtvycG7wxJ8&t=4167.88s)]
*  And I would get some recordings with your dad if he is still alive. I couldn't tell from the call. [[01:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtvycG7wxJ8&t=4173.96s)]
*  And spend some time with him as much as you can and get some of that video and audio recorded too. [[01:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtvycG7wxJ8&t=4178.84s)]
*  Always have that. You know, I have a few pictures from my dad. [[01:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtvycG7wxJ8&t=4182.599999999999s)]
*  And you know, his other family took everything else. And yes, I'm kind of resentful about that shit. [[01:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtvycG7wxJ8&t=4190.04s)]
*  But anyway, I'm sorry you're going through that, man. Thanks for sharing. [[01:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtvycG7wxJ8&t=4203.24s)]

*  And that's what I got, man. What else? [[01:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtvycG7wxJ8&t=4212.5199999999995s)]

*  I'm so happy for him, baby. That was amazing. I can't believe I got to go to France. What the heck, man? [[01:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtvycG7wxJ8&t=4225.639999999999s)]
