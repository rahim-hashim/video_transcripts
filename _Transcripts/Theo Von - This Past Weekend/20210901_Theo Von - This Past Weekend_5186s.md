# Gingerbread Traphouse  This Past Weekend w Theo Von #356
**Theo Von - This Past Weekend:** [September 01, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6xq2Gch0ag)
*  Good evening and good morning and good time, whatever time it is for you and hello. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6xq2Gch0ag&t=0.0s)]
*  I want to start by just saying that my thoughts and well wishes are with everybody who's suffering [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6xq2Gch0ag&t=10.68s)]
*  right now from the storms, from the water, from the wreckage, from the, you know, somebody [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6xq2Gch0ag&t=17.94s)]
*  people even boating by your house, strange men boating by, you know, some strange man [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6xq2Gch0ag&t=28.400000000000002s)]
*  boating through your yard trying to holler at you or your son or your daughter or anybody, [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6xq2Gch0ag&t=35.120000000000005s)]
*  gay man or straight man or lesbian or anybody. You know what I'm saying? I'm just, I just, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6xq2Gch0ag&t=41.68s)]
*  you know, are people with their power out? I'm just saying when your yard is suddenly a water, [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6xq2Gch0ag&t=48.160000000000004s)]
*  a waterway, the perverts can get right up by the window [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6xq2Gch0ag&t=54.4s)]
*  in a little pierog or a little paddleboard. You'll see a damn a pedo on a paddleboard out there just [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6xq2Gch0ag&t=61.440000000000005s)]
*  so it's a, you know, just different times. It's, you know, you're dealing with a different [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6xq2Gch0ag&t=72.88s)]
*  textile. You're dealing with water [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6xq2Gch0ag&t=78.96000000000001s)]
*  and, and it's wild, man. Mother nature is wild, isn't she? You know, that's one thing we start to [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6xq2Gch0ag&t=80.88s)]
*  forget is we get so much, you know, we have so many apps and this and that and different control [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6xq2Gch0ag&t=88.88s)]
*  things and we think we can control it all. And you forget that you're sitting, you're playing poker [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6xq2Gch0ag&t=95.11999999999999s)]
*  with a woman that has a, she has access to a deck that's, that's really, that we, you know, we can't [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6xq2Gch0ag&t=105.28s)]
*  buy it in stores, not available in stores, as they say on the, you know, the television and whatever. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6xq2Gch0ag&t=116.96000000000001s)]
*  And mother nature drops that thing, you know, earth, wind, water, fire, whatever, shooting stars, [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6xq2Gch0ag&t=125.6s)]
*  you know, she's got these, you know, she, you know, falling boulder, quicksand, [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6xq2Gch0ag&t=132.8s)]
*  you know, mother nature has all those, you know, she can do it, she can do so many things. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6xq2Gch0ag&t=142.08s)]
*  She can do something as subtle as, you know, keep a kid's kite up in the air [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6xq2Gch0ag&t=148.64000000000001s)]
*  or as, as simple as, you know, you know, you can do something like that. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6xq2Gch0ag&t=154.72000000000003s)]
*  As brutal as just drown a village, you know. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6xq2Gch0ag&t=162.88000000000002s)]
*  There was one aquarium I saw somewhere, the animals in there all drowned, the water came in there and [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6xq2Gch0ag&t=169.84s)]
*  they're like, these animals drowned. And I'm like, what? But that's mother nature. I mean, she's got [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6xq2Gch0ag&t=174.56s)]
*  a batch of bad water. She has different batches of things that we, we don't have control over. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6xq2Gch0ag&t=181.76000000000002s)]
*  So it's interesting when nature starts to play those cards, how real things really can get and, [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6xq2Gch0ag&t=187.92s)]
*  and yeah, my thoughts are, are with anybody that's struggling or suffering or [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6xq2Gch0ag&t=193.2s)]
*  that's lost something, you know, and I'm looking to keep my eyes open to, to be supportive in, [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6xq2Gch0ag&t=198.64s)]
*  in spaces where, where people have been affected. And I'm sure a lot of you guys are as well. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6xq2Gch0ag&t=205.76s)]
*  So good to be back with you. Good to be back here together. We haven't had a solo episode in a while. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6xq2Gch0ag&t=210.88s)]
*  Thanks for your patience. One of my goals this fall is to get back on a weekly regular, [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6xq2Gch0ag&t=215.6s)]
*  you know, Monday release date or Tuesday release date of solo episodes so that, [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6xq2Gch0ag&t=224.0s)]
*  we can just kind of have, you know, a little bit of structure to our community. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6xq2Gch0ag&t=230.32s)]
*  And I'm looking forward to that. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6xq2Gch0ag&t=234.64s)]
*  You know, that water comes, the water, it's such an interesting thoroughfare water. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6xq2Gch0ag&t=236.0s)]
*  You know, if you hold your breath, you can get down in it, but that's, [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6xq2Gch0ag&t=250.96s)]
*  you know, that's really a limited time deal. You know, that's real brachial. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6xq2Gch0ag&t=256.32s)]
*  That's only as much as long as you can hold in your, in your lungs. It's hella brachial. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6xq2Gch0ag&t=260.72s)]
*  Yeah. That water, it's a water, it's a, you know, it's a, it's that dip, but you know, it's that, [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6xq2Gch0ag&t=266.71999999999997s)]
*  it's the washing off. It's the, it's the cleansing, you know, [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6xq2Gch0ag&t=273.52s)]
*  if you're eating something, you get a sip of water to kind of give you, [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6xq2Gch0ag&t=278.71999999999997s)]
*  give your mouth that little bit of restart. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6xq2Gch0ag&t=283.12s)]
*  You know, it's just interesting water, what it can do, the, what would the, [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6xq2Gch0ag&t=287.52s)]
*  the, the, the different things we use it for. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6xq2Gch0ag&t=290.32s)]
*  You know, even make electricity out of it. Who would ever thought that? [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6xq2Gch0ag&t=295.91999999999996s)]
*  That's wizardry. I mean, that is wizardry. You're looking at water and thinking, damn, [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6xq2Gch0ag&t=299.76s)]
*  one day I'm going to watch some television off of this shit. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6xq2Gch0ag&t=306.64s)]
*  I mean, that's unbelievable to stare at a damn aquarium and be like, you know what? [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6xq2Gch0ag&t=310.32s)]
*  One day I'm going to dry my hair and it's all because of this bitch, you know? [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6xq2Gch0ag&t=319.12s)]
*  Just different times, man, with that water in mind, man, and with, [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6xq2Gch0ag&t=325.84s)]

*  That's what I realized over time I realized i'm the lock [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6xq2Gch0ag&t=1828.88s)]
*  And somebody else is the key and it can almost usually be anybody else anybody that's not myself [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6xq2Gch0ag&t=1834.64s)]

*  That's the trick [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6xq2Gch0ag&t=1845.92s)]

*  and [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6xq2Gch0ag&t=1924.64s)]
*  You know, nothing's really going on emotionally or anything. Everything's kind of nice right now, but [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6xq2Gch0ag&t=1925.6000000000001s)]
*  My hair man, my hair is starting to go gray. It might be kind of hard to tell from the video [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6xq2Gch0ag&t=1931.2s)]
*  But but it's creeping in creeping in I got my first gray hair when I was like 21 [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6xq2Gch0ag&t=1935.3600000000001s)]
*  So I kind of knew this day was was gonna come but within the last year man [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6xq2Gch0ag&t=1939.6s)]
*  It's really just started to started to take over. It's it's wild and so [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6xq2Gch0ag&t=1943.92s)]
*  Need some advice dude. Do you think I should start dying it try to get some of these shampoos going that that fix this stuff [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6xq2Gch0ag&t=1948.6399999999999s)]
*  Or should I just let it roll all natural and get some like, you know, some like willy nelson braids going on [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6xq2Gch0ag&t=1955.44s)]
*  And I don't know. I'm really trying to figure it out [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6xq2Gch0ag&t=1962.72s)]
*  I'm cool with it for right now, but I like to plan ahead and kind of kind of know where i'm gonna go with this stuff [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6xq2Gch0ag&t=1965.36s)]
*  so [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6xq2Gch0ag&t=1970.3999999999999s)]
*  Gang baby, I think if a little touch isn't bad [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6xq2Gch0ag&t=1971.28s)]
*  A little touch of gray a little flash in the pan, you know [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6xq2Gch0ag&t=1975.36s)]
*  What is that? [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6xq2Gch0ag&t=1980.0s)]
*  Oh, look at him. You know, he's dying part of his head is dying [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6xq2Gch0ag&t=1981.68s)]
*  You know, it's a little hype, you know, it's like a little um [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6xq2Gch0ag&t=1986.16s)]
*  It's a pr stunt a little bit for your hair. Your hair's like hey, hey [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6xq2Gch0ag&t=1990.08s)]
*  I might take my own life and some of your hair saying that almost [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6xq2Gch0ag&t=1995.52s)]
*  Um, I think it's good to get a little [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6xq2Gch0ag&t=2000.08s)]
*  There's a lot of uh, this is this is the mistake [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6xq2Gch0ag&t=2004.48s)]
*  That I'd made when I started getting a couple grays and I don't want them to hear me say it because they [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6xq2Gch0ag&t=2009.44s)]
*  But you know what i'm saying when I started getting a couple grays [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6xq2Gch0ag&t=2018.08s)]
*  Ra wise [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6xq2Gch0ag&t=2021.06s)]
*  If they hear it though, I think feel like they'll make more um, I started pulling them out [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6xq2Gch0ag&t=2023.94s)]
*  Start pulling them out [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6xq2Gch0ag&t=2032.6599999999999s)]
*  Because you think oh, I don't want anybody to see them. Here's what happens. That's why this why that's a bad idea because [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6xq2Gch0ag&t=2035.06s)]
*  down the road [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6xq2Gch0ag&t=2041.22s)]
*  You [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6xq2Gch0ag&t=2044.58s)]
*  Will start losing your hair [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6xq2Gch0ag&t=2045.62s)]
*  and at that point [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6xq2Gch0ag&t=2048.34s)]
*  You're gonna wish you had the grays [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6xq2Gch0ag&t=2050.26s)]
*  You're gonna wish you had all hairs all hairs on deck [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6xq2Gch0ag&t=2052.82s)]
*  So I think if you want to color them you could use a there's some stuff you could use to lighten the grade or stuff [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6xq2Gch0ag&t=2057.86s)]
*  You could use to go full throttle [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6xq2Gch0ag&t=2063.0600000000004s)]
*  But I don't think you do not pluck them bro [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6xq2Gch0ag&t=2065.78s)]
*  Do not pluck them little you know, those are your soldiers too, man. They've been in the war for you [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6xq2Gch0ag&t=2069.0600000000004s)]
*  They're kind of it's kind of like the veterans administration a little bit your hair is just kind of you know [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6xq2Gch0ag&t=2075.6200000000003s)]
*  Those boys have been a war for you. They might have been the first ones out the gate [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6xq2Gch0ag&t=2081.2200000000003s)]
*  Some of them could have been public hairs that [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6xq2Gch0ag&t=2087.0600000000004s)]
*  You know migrated north or something if things got dicey down there [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6xq2Gch0ag&t=2091.38s)]
*  You know [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6xq2Gch0ag&t=2096.42s)]
*  Maybe one of your nuts went bad or something and scared the area and then bam [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6xq2Gch0ag&t=2097.7000000000003s)]
*  Some of your public hairs [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6xq2Gch0ag&t=2103.46s)]
*  Came out your top [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6xq2Gch0ag&t=2106.42s)]
*  Your head [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6xq2Gch0ag&t=2108.58s)]
*  So I think that you got to treat them like that [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6xq2Gch0ag&t=2110.74s)]
*  They might have been scared. Maybe they watched a scary movie [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6xq2Gch0ag&t=2113.7s)]
*  and you know, you fell asleep, but some of them stayed up and [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6xq2Gch0ag&t=2117.62s)]
*  And now they're grayed out [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6xq2Gch0ag&t=2121.14s)]
*  But keep them do not pluck them because down the line you will want to have any hairs you can have and you'd be like damn [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6xq2Gch0ag&t=2123.7s)]
*  That pulls them bastards out at the root [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6xq2Gch0ag&t=2131.38s)]
*  So I think I would say a little bit of touch is good but at a certain point color it up [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6xq2Gch0ag&t=2134.1800000000003s)]
*  If you're still shopping for a mate [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6xq2Gch0ag&t=2139.54s)]
*  If you still trying to touch, you know [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6xq2Gch0ag&t=2143.06s)]
*  Touch a little bit of damp on some lady or you know, if you're trying to grab rod on a man if you gay [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6xq2Gch0ag&t=2146.1800000000003s)]
*  If you're trying to grab rod on a man or touch damp [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6xq2Gch0ag&t=2153.7000000000003s)]
*  on a woman then you wanna [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6xq2Gch0ag&t=2157.3s)]
*  You're gonna want to keep your hair now if you're married or whatever you like [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6xq2Gch0ag&t=2159.54s)]

*  You know to be living at a place [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6xq2Gch0ag&t=2348.36s)]
*  But [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6xq2Gch0ag&t=2352.04s)]
*  And it's not a lot to ask [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6xq2Gch0ag&t=2353.7999999999997s)]
*  That way when you do the pledge of the legions if you do that you have the flag there it's a small bit to ask [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6xq2Gch0ag&t=2356.44s)]
*  To just show some respect [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6xq2Gch0ag&t=2368.28s)]
*  You know in a country I don't you know, it's interesting this lady, you know [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6xq2Gch0ag&t=2371.0800000000004s)]

*  You know, I guess just she just thinks people automatically get [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6xq2Gch0ag&t=2379.6400000000003s)]
*  Um, i'd love to see her make this video in afghanistan or in maybe um [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6xq2Gch0ag&t=2382.76s)]
*  Saudi arabia, I would love to see her make this there that would be [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6xq2Gch0ag&t=2389.4s)]
*  Very interesting doesn't seem like that that that would be possible [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6xq2Gch0ag&t=2395.0s)]
*  Just seems interesting that it made her feel uncomfortable the american flag [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6xq2Gch0ag&t=2401.1600000000003s)]
*  That's some of the stuff. I don't get [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6xq2Gch0ag&t=2405.96s)]

*  You know [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6xq2Gch0ag&t=2414.84s)]
*  You're just everything is already all about us. Everything's all about me me me [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6xq2Gch0ag&t=2416.44s)]
*  So you have one moment in a day where you can bring people together? [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6xq2Gch0ag&t=2421.64s)]
*  And have them do kind of just show a small homage or something that's not about them [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6xq2Gch0ag&t=2427.48s)]
*  And that this is what you choose to do instead you choose to make this tiktok [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6xq2Gch0ag&t=2435.56s)]
*  You know, i'm sure like [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6xq2Gch0ag&t=2439.72s)]
*  You know, I mean [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6xq2Gch0ag&t=2442.36s)]

*  It's a symbol. It made her uncomfortable [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6xq2Gch0ag&t=2450.68s)]
*  It just I don't know I wish there was some sort form of treason this is just my thought [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6xq2Gch0ag&t=2455.88s)]
*  Now if other people have different thoughts, you don't like the fact that's fine [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6xq2Gch0ag&t=2461.56s)]
*  I personally think it's a little strange [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6xq2Gch0ag&t=2465.16s)]
*  I think it's disrespectful [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6xq2Gch0ag&t=2469.2400000000002s)]
*  You know, I think it's weird to enjoy all the freedoms but act like [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6xq2Gch0ag&t=2471.88s)]

*  It doesn't [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6xq2Gch0ag&t=2640.52s)]
*  And maybe some people feel that this country doesn't represent them [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6xq2Gch0ag&t=2643.3199999999997s)]
*  Uh, but this is where we're at. It's just society. It's like [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6xq2Gch0ag&t=2647.72s)]

*  They're not maybe into an afterlife. They don't believe in any [[00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6xq2Gch0ag&t=3441.1s)]
*  They might not believe in you know, you're just ride surfing the ether out there after they might think it's just lights out [[00:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6xq2Gch0ag&t=3445.02s)]
*  So, of course, they're gonna bet all their you know, all their duckets on this [[00:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6xq2Gch0ag&t=3451.7400000000002s)]
*  But I think you gotta let mother nature roll through [[00:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6xq2Gch0ag&t=3455.34s)]
*  Because I think that's all that's what's gonna happen anyway [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6xq2Gch0ag&t=3460.3s)]
*  She's already switching it up. All right. Here's this other version. The thing has to pass through [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6xq2Gch0ag&t=3464.1400000000003s)]
*  That's where i'm at with it now if you disagree with me, that's fine, i'm not mad at you [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6xq2Gch0ag&t=3470.54s)]
*  I think you gotta cover your old people and keep them safe. You know [[00:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6xq2Gch0ag&t=3476.7000000000003s)]
*  I think mother nature has a bigger plan for things now also [[00:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6xq2Gch0ag&t=3479.9s)]
*  I grew up next to the primate center in covington, louisiana [[00:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6xq2Gch0ag&t=3484.38s)]
*  And they tested the polio vaccine over there [[00:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6xq2Gch0ag&t=3490.06s)]
*  This is fact go look it up [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6xq2Gch0ag&t=3493.42s)]
*  It's where they even created the polio vaccine [[00:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6xq2Gch0ag&t=3495.98s)]
*  And [[00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6xq2Gch0ag&t=3500.94s)]
*  The vaccine is a vaccine [[00:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6xq2Gch0ag&t=3503.1800000000003s)]
*  And the vaccine gave cervical cancer to millions of women [[00:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6xq2Gch0ag&t=3505.18s)]
*  But they'd already made the vaccine [[00:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6xq2Gch0ag&t=3514.54s)]
*  Sutter so they the government [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6xq2Gch0ag&t=3518.2999999999997s)]
*  And the pharmaceutical company, I don't know if it was if pharma was involved then if it was just the government doing it [[00:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6xq2Gch0ag&t=3522.14s)]
*  They just said fuck. We already paid for it all [[00:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6xq2Gch0ag&t=3528.62s)]
*  They just said fuck we already paid for it all [[00:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6xq2Gch0ag&t=3531.58s)]
*  Some of y'all is gonna have you know, that sloppy cervix going on [[00:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6xq2Gch0ag&t=3535.8999999999996s)]
*  Some of y'all is gonna have to be cervixed out [[00:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6xq2Gch0ag&t=3540.8599999999997s)]
*  And they gave it to everybody anyway, because they'd already made the vaccination [[00:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6xq2Gch0ag&t=3543.58s)]
*  See what i'm saying so [[00:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6xq2Gch0ag&t=3549.3399999999997s)]
*  So now I don't I so automatically I was born in a bed of distrust right there [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6xq2Gch0ag&t=3550.8599999999997s)]
*  Being in that area that's in the water by me [[00:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6xq2Gch0ag&t=3557.02s)]
*  So for me when you add on the fact that now everybody's just trusting pharmaceutical companies [[00:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6xq2Gch0ag&t=3562.14s)]
*  I don't trust big pharmaceutical companies, man [[00:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6xq2Gch0ag&t=3569.74s)]
*  I hate the fact that i'm addicted to antidepressants [[00:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6xq2Gch0ag&t=3573.4199999999996s)]
*  I hate the fact that during covid i've lost six friends to overdose [[00:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6xq2Gch0ag&t=3577.74s)]
*  Six friends man real human friends that I know that I could call on my phone [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6xq2Gch0ag&t=3583.66s)]
*  I've lost them to overdosing [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6xq2Gch0ag&t=3588.7s)]
*  Now some of it was uh opioid opioid overdoses, I think four of them were opioid overdoses [[00:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6xq2Gch0ag&t=3593.4199999999996s)]
*  So I don't trust big pharma dog, I don't trust these fucks man I do not [[01:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6xq2Gch0ag&t=3602.46s)]
*  So that's kind of where i'm at with it [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6xq2Gch0ag&t=3610.46s)]
*  That's kind of where i'm at with it, you know, i'm okay if mother nature takes me i'm okay if she keeps me [[01:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6xq2Gch0ag&t=3613.66s)]
*  But and you and I don't have to agree the same man [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6xq2Gch0ag&t=3622.7s)]
*  You know, and if you have a thought on it, you're welcome to hit the hotline [[01:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6xq2Gch0ag&t=3625.98s)]
*  Nine eight five six six four nine five zero three. I know we're all kind of over a lot of that kind of stuff [[01:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6xq2Gch0ag&t=3628.44s)]
*  But I don't I just don't see now that we had all the vaccination all everybody separate [[01:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6xq2Gch0ag&t=3635.74s)]
*  Everybody wear these masks all this shit and now even more people are getting it [[01:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6xq2Gch0ag&t=3641.7400000000002s)]
*  Obviously whatever we were doing to me [[01:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6xq2Gch0ag&t=3647.2400000000002s)]
*  Wasn't working [[01:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6xq2Gch0ag&t=3650.3s)]
*  So i'm just the guy man [[01:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6xq2Gch0ag&t=3652.94s)]
*  I like being a part of mother nature [[01:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6xq2Gch0ag&t=3655.6600000000003s)]
*  You know, I like seeing a lamb. I like [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6xq2Gch0ag&t=3658.86s)]
*  Smelling a rose or smelling a daffodil [[01:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6xq2Gch0ag&t=3661.82s)]
*  Some people I guess see all that shit and they don't trust it [[01:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6xq2Gch0ag&t=3666.78s)]
*  I'm not a fan of that [[01:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6xq2Gch0ag&t=3671.98s)]
*  I'm not a fan of that [[01:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6xq2Gch0ag&t=3675.1800000000003s)]
*  But that's not where i'm at [[01:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6xq2Gch0ag&t=3679.02s)]
*  I'm of the theory manless [[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6xq2Gch0ag&t=3682.38s)]
*  You know, we're already in the play in the game with mother nature to [[01:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6xq2Gch0ag&t=3687.02s)]
*  To think that she doesn't have bigger cards than us when it's obviously that she can flex when she wants [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6xq2Gch0ag&t=3690.86s)]
*  I think the little thing we're going to create is is is really going to lock it down [[01:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6xq2Gch0ag&t=3696.06s)]
*  Now, I know there's been other stuff in the past, you know [[01:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6xq2Gch0ag&t=3699.82s)]
*  You know, I think the black plague or whatever they beat it with something and polio they beat it but they also [[01:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6xq2Gch0ag&t=3705.7400000000002s)]
*  Dude, go look back on it. This is facts, man [[01:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6xq2Gch0ag&t=3711.82s)]
*  They give a lot of cervical cancer to a lot of broads out there who probably didn't want cervical cancer [[01:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6xq2Gch0ag&t=3713.9s)]
*  So you got to think about them as well [[01:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6xq2Gch0ag&t=3722.62s)]
*  Um, let's see if we can get one more two more calls and we got a single mom we're gonna hit up [[01:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6xq2Gch0ag&t=3725.02s)]

*  Yeah, thanks bro, thanks for the nice message man. Yeah, I am lucky man. I am really lucky. Uh [[01:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6xq2Gch0ag&t=3959.98s)]

*  And you know, I have a lady that's been trying really hard [[01:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6xq2Gch0ag&t=3977.66s)]
*  To stick by my side and i've been trying to uh, reciprocate her efforts [[01:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6xq2Gch0ag&t=3981.18s)]
*  in a shoulder I care and keeping things afloat but it's uh, it's it's tougher than I think [[01:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6xq2Gch0ag&t=3988.22s)]
*  You who person is and maybe it's the artist thing. Maybe it's just a fucking weird [[01:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6xq2Gch0ag&t=3995.8999999999996s)]
*  Well, man is definitely something in the artist part I think [[01:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6xq2Gch0ag&t=4001.8199999999997s)]
*  I mean, you know, because I think artists as an artist man, I noticed this about myself and I don't want to admit this [[01:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6xq2Gch0ag&t=4005.58s)]
*  I'm real sensitive [[01:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6xq2Gch0ag&t=4011.3399999999997s)]

*  You know and I always was that way [[01:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6xq2Gch0ag&t=4017.18s)]
*  and so [[01:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6xq2Gch0ag&t=4019.4199999999996s)]
*  I think that's why you make art because you have these extra feelings kind of spinning around and these extra thoughts and stuff and so [[01:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6xq2Gch0ag&t=4020.7s)]
*  You have to do something with them [[01:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6xq2Gch0ag&t=4028.06s)]
*  and so you create things that then [[01:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6xq2Gch0ag&t=4030.7s)]
*  Create that help other people have thoughts and feelings when you hear music or you see art sometimes you get a thought or a feeling [[01:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6xq2Gch0ag&t=4036.14s)]
*  So, of course the those things were created by thoughts and feelings that only make sense [[01:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6xq2Gch0ag&t=4045.4199999999996s)]
*  um [[01:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6xq2Gch0ag&t=4052.7s)]
*  So yeah, I get all this sensitivity man, uh [[01:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6xq2Gch0ag&t=4056.54s)]
*  And for me I know drugs and alcohol and stuff like that doesn't [[01:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6xq2Gch0ag&t=4061.18s)]
*  Sensitivity doesn't those things that don't it doesn't mix real well [[01:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6xq2Gch0ag&t=4065.3199999999997s)]
*  Because for me I notice i'm already a little bit high on myself in a weird way [[01:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6xq2Gch0ag&t=4071.18s)]
*  I'm a little bit already kind of artistic. I'm a little fucking [[01:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6xq2Gch0ag&t=4077.5s)]
*  I'm not drunk, but [[01:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6xq2Gch0ag&t=4084.06s)]
*  Something inside of me is I think [[01:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6xq2Gch0ag&t=4087.3399999999997s)]
*  Sometimes my heart might be drunk or my [[01:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6xq2Gch0ag&t=4090.62s)]
*  My brain might be geeked up on something god gave it, you know, I don't know [[01:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6xq2Gch0ag&t=4093.58s)]
*  But I I know it's uh [[01:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6xq2Gch0ag&t=4108.78s)]
*  I know it's being creative. It's tough because you feel a lot and you think a lot [[01:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6xq2Gch0ag&t=4112.94s)]
*  You know and just recently i've been reminded that [[01:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6xq2Gch0ag&t=4119.98s)]
*  I [[01:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6xq2Gch0ag&t=4123.099999999999s)]
*  My feelings don't matter that much [[01:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6xq2Gch0ag&t=4124.62s)]
*  They matter they're real, you know, they're real and I can have them and it's okay to share with people [[01:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6xq2Gch0ag&t=4127.18s)]
*  and [[01:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6xq2Gch0ag&t=4132.7s)]
*  But what I do is what matters [[01:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6xq2Gch0ag&t=4134.22s)]
*  You know heard you talk about a relationship and somebody that cares about you and man [[01:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6xq2Gch0ag&t=4138.78s)]
*  You know, I have this weird for me my receiver is broken [[01:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6xq2Gch0ag&t=4146.7s)]
*  You know, I can't feel people care about me as much as I I can't feel I you know, I want to [[01:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6xq2Gch0ag&t=4153.34s)]
*  And but I think my receiver my receptor is there's something wrong with my receptor [[01:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6xq2Gch0ag&t=4160.62s)]
*  And it's broken [[01:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6xq2Gch0ag&t=4166.94s)]
*  um, it's not completely broken, but [[01:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6xq2Gch0ag&t=4169.82s)]
*  I mean they you know [[01:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6xq2Gch0ag&t=4174.38s)]
*  They it ain't you know, I probably could use a replacement but they didn't issue the uh, [[01:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6xq2Gch0ag&t=4176.7s)]
*  You know when you get that card in the mail it says like the drive shaft is [[01:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6xq2Gch0ag&t=4181.580000000001s)]
*  you know, it's called like um [[01:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6xq2Gch0ag&t=4185.34s)]
*  reap [[01:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6xq2Gch0ag&t=4187.900000000001s)]
*  Recall they should have done a recall [[01:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6xq2Gch0ag&t=4189.26s)]
*  on my receptors [[01:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6xq2Gch0ag&t=4192.46s)]
*  You know, I can't feel when people care about me that much. I just can't feel it [[01:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6xq2Gch0ag&t=4194.780000000001s)]
*  I can see it and I can but it just doesn't land on me the right way [[01:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6xq2Gch0ag&t=4198.9400000000005s)]
*  So, I don't know man, maybe you have some of the same things that I have [[01:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6xq2Gch0ag&t=4206.38s)]
*  uh [[01:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6xq2Gch0ag&t=4211.42s)]
*  But the things that I do know are what I do. Those are real things. So my actions those are very real [[01:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6xq2Gch0ag&t=4212.540000000001s)]
*  You know my feelings are they try to they're real strong because i'm sensitive so I get extra feelings, bro [[01:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6xq2Gch0ag&t=4218.38s)]
*  Like i'm standing in the lunch line of like when your soul gets put together and that bitch just keeps putting feelings on my plate [[01:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6xq2Gch0ag&t=4224.3s)]
*  i'm like damn [[01:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6xq2Gch0ag&t=4231.5s)]
*  I can't even carry my tray anymore. I can barely even carry my my my my uh [[01:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6xq2Gch0ag&t=4234.14s)]

*  And so i'm heavy with feelings. I always am [[01:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6xq2Gch0ag&t=4244.06s)]
*  I'm so heavy with feelings, man [[01:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6xq2Gch0ag&t=4247.26s)]
*  And that's okay. There's nothing wrong with me. I'm not a bad person [[01:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6xq2Gch0ag&t=4250.46s)]
*  You know, it's good, you know, maybe uh, sometimes it's good [[01:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6xq2Gch0ag&t=4253.9800000000005s)]
*  You know because I can it does allow me to have extra feelings to use to create art and do certain things [[01:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6xq2Gch0ag&t=4258.06s)]
*  but [[01:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6xq2Gch0ag&t=4264.22s)]
*  But yeah, I have a really tough time connecting with people man [[01:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6xq2Gch0ag&t=4265.740000000001s)]
*  you know and [[01:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6xq2Gch0ag&t=4269.18s)]
*  There's definitely some women out there. I owe some apologies to who have stuck by my side and [[01:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6xq2Gch0ag&t=4271.18s)]
*  I just couldn't get it get it right [[01:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6xq2Gch0ag&t=4276.540000000001s)]

*  um [[01:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6xq2Gch0ag&t=4292.06s)]
*  But yeah, you know just don't be too hard on yourself [[01:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6xq2Gch0ag&t=4294.3s)]
*  But just remember your actions are the things that we can really those are where we can see the proof [[01:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6xq2Gch0ag&t=4296.38s)]
*  If I look for the proof in all my feelings man, fuck i'll be over there forever. That's a lost and found [[01:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6xq2Gch0ag&t=4302.62s)]
