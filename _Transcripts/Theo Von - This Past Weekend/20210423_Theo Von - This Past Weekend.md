*  I'd be online if I said she didn't occupy one of my a orders a lot of times and [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=6.04s)]
*  You know, she's a very loving lady that is part of the podcast community and a wonderful podcaster in her own, right? [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=11.84s)]

*  She has a new podcast called blood bath that you can check out [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=21.16s)]
*  She's a real heartbeat in the world [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=26.96s)]
*  And we're happy to have her here today [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=30.0s)]
*  Miss kalilah [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=32.24s)]
*  I'll sit and tell you [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=46.0s)]
*  Just [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=60.0s)]
*  You're always one of the comics that I always felt like [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=67.76s)]
*  Well, I like him which is [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=72.24s)]
*  Really? [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=75.04s)]
*  Thank you. I [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=76.16s)]
*  always I mean, I think it's hard whenever somebody sees you not to be like [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=78.0s)]
*  You know have some sort of [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=83.68s)]
*  Desire around you or something like that, you know, I think you see you I think you seem very desirable [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=86.80000000000001s)]
*  I have a question about that. Yeah [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=91.72s)]
*  Especially to a white man or semi white I'm semi white [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=95.64s)]
*  There's the question of desirability [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=99.04s)]
*  Have to do with who my partner is like if a guy sees me [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=101.44s)]
*  Yeah, there's the desirability level go up because he thinks that Bobby is somehow not an equal to me [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=106.04s)]
*  Or like let's say I was with like a strapping six foot four guy, okay [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=113.60000000000001s)]
*  Okay, like what do you mean like a like a tongan or something? [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=119.92s)]
*  Tongan. Yeah, love Tongans. Okay. Yeah, so you're saying so if you were like with a big like rugby player, okay [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=123.60000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, yeah rugby guy. Yeah. Yeah, whatever immediately in a guy's mind. Would I just be off-limits? [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=130.32s)]
*  Would you be off-limits if I saw you with him? [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=135.28s)]
*  Versus you seeing me with my little yeah my little boiled egg [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=137.8s)]
*  Do you know what I mean like does that matter I mean I just know Bobby has I just I feel like with Bobby [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=144.32s)]
*  There's more of and I say this only out of respect. I love Bobby and [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=150.74s)]
*  You know, I hope I get to be a pallbearer at his funeral if anything ever happens to him, which I hope nothing [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=155.12s)]
*  I said I thought you were gonna say wedding [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=158.92000000000002s)]
*  Don't please don't wish him that [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=163.16s)]
*  I'll kill myself is I will say this though and I say it out of love and respect and I tell him this a lot [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=165.6s)]
*  He is more [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=170.04s)]
*  Like you can tell that death looks for him a little you know, like he's had some of the addiction stuff. He's had [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=171.72s)]
*  You know, he's very he looks very [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=178.16s)]
*  You know, he looks really like a strong shellfish would kill him to be honest [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=181.64s)]
*  But what I'm saying is so when you see my strong shellfish we're talking like a big lobster with a big carapace [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=185.64s)]
*  Okay [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=192.16s)]
*  like [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=193.35999999999999s)]
*  Spiny lobster. No, I'm talking like something to pull a food poisoning. I [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=194.32s)]
*  Was thinking that a lobster would attack him in the ocean [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=201.51999999999998s)]
*  I could see a lobster attacking him. It may be like a pool at like a hampton [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=206.23999999999998s)]
*  But I give a beautiful laugh too, but I think a lobster attacking him like at a no [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=211.79999999999998s)]
*  I was thinking more him eating a bad shrimp or having a bad piece of pork somewhere [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=218.48s)]
*  Okay, you know especially with you guys combining forces of [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=222.2s)]
*  You guys come from a very background of a lot of street food [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=227.23999999999998s)]
*  It's very popular in your cultures. And so I think that doubles the chances of somebody has an American stomach [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=230.39999999999998s)]
*  I don't care what his culture is. That thing is not steel clad. That's not metal clad [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=236.51999999999998s)]
*  He has diarrhea all day long. Oh, yeah [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=242.18s)]
*  He actually looks like where diarrhea started [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=247.79999999999998s)]
*  I don't know if they can trace it but I could see [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=252.51999999999998s)]
*  Suddenly the fuzz just showing up at y'all's door. I mean looking it down and Bobby's just on the John [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=257.2s)]
*  You know just looking up he can't get anything. He can't keep anything down. It seems it's just intractable diarrhea all day long [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=262.3s)]
*  It's unbelievable [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=268.76s)]
*  Well, you know, he's so here's what I do think [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=270.8s)]
*  I think when you see a guy when you see a girl like you with Bobby and I love Bobby and Bobby's probably one of [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=272.48s)]
*  my 50 probably 40 favorite people I would bet 30 [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=277.64s)]
*  30 top 30 but you you think Bobby is more prone to [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=281.24s)]
*  Death I think then if I saw you with like a big six-foot guy that guy seems like always gonna live forever [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=287.76s)]
*  So Bobby there's a not in a bad way [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=293.04s)]
*  You know, I know I'm sure Bobby's gonna live for a long time, but you just see him as being like [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=295.71999999999997s)]
*  Oh anything could happen. He you know, he drives and plays games. He just he puts himself in dangerous ways [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=300.64s)]
*  so I think then there's allows a little more room for [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=305.76s)]
*  Who is gonna care for this woman if something ever happened to him and not in a bad way [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=309.68s)]
*  But if and so it's out of love [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=315.62s)]
*  I think that you look and say okay [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=317.28000000000003s)]
*  Whereas if I saw you with some guy like Bill Clinton like a young Bill Clinton or something [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=318.8s)]
*  Then I think I would be like, oh man [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=323.36s)]
*  You know even after he dies, he'll still be able to take care of her [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=326.12s)]
*  Well, I think that well, I don't know if ghost Bobby could hold you down [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=329.92s)]
*  Is what I'm saying. I [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=334.0s)]
*  Don't know. Can somebody help me out here [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=336.12s)]
*  I think Bobby would haunt this shit out of both of us. Yeah, that's true. I [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=338.92s)]
*  mean if you're [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=343.44s)]
*  I don't know what you're trying to say Theo, but you're saying [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=344.96000000000004s)]
*  Are you are you in line to catch me should he die? [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=349.84000000000003s)]
*  are you the man to take care of this woman and [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=354.16s)]
*  This damsel in distress. What is this like a is this a proposal? No [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=357.40000000000003s)]
*  I I this is what I wanted to actually hash out with you. Okay for some reason I get a barrage of messages [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=362.0s)]
*  Okay, what is barrage? I mean, that's French. Isn't it barrage? It could be just always messages [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=368.52s)]
*  pertaining or [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=374.91999999999996s)]
*  accusatory messages thinking that you and I are in some sort of [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=376.56s)]
*  That you're my side piece that you're my second [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=380.67999999999995s)]
*  and [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=383.28s)]
*  I don't know where that comes from cuz I don't feel like we've ever talked about it on our podcast or have we I have [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=384.23999999999995s)]
*  Never said anything like that. I mean, I don't know if they [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=389.67999999999995s)]
*  Do you feel like there's any attraction between us or no? I I [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=393.2s)]
*  Personally don't think so [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=397.64000000000004s)]
*  But I like you a lot. So I said do you feel like there is I don't mean that in a bad way [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=400.24s)]
*  Okay here. Let me try to break this out in like a really transparent way. I want to be honest [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=404.36s)]
*  Um [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=407.92s)]
*  There are people that I walk past that I feel like an instant like chemistry with I'm not threatened by that feeling at all [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=409.76000000000005s)]
*  It just kind of like clock it and then you know, it's it's it validates that I'm human [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=416.0s)]
*  I do have it with certain people in his life, but not you. Okay. Okay [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=421.52000000000004s)]
*  Because you feel more like family yeah [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=435.0s)]
*  I know Louisiana's not [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=438.28000000000003s)]
*  So here's what I'm saying is all right [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=442.28000000000003s)]
*  No, I I yeah I just I think that [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=447.16s)]
*  Guess when I look at you and Bobby, what was the original question really if if dudes calculate in their mind? [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=451.32000000000005s)]
*  Some a woman's desirability based on who she's with like no, okay [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=458.88000000000005s)]
*  I don't think I you know, that's a good question. Do guys calculate a woman's desirability [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=464.48s)]
*  Based on who she's with I think well some girls you see and you can just tell a lot of time [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=469.44000000000005s)]
*  I [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=475.76s)]
*  Some girls I think you see sometimes and it looks like a money type of thing [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=478.0s)]
*  Well, a lot of people assume that about me about you and Bobby [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=483.47999999999996s)]
*  Yeah, of course like that's the immediate assumption [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=486.56s)]
*  Which is I think is really unfair because I think Bobby's really cute [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=489.5s)]
*  Like I've always been into short fat boys like that's my type. Yeah, Bobby's undeniably cute Bobby's probably [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=493.15999999999997s)]
*  Bobby it's crazy Bobby even Bobby verse a black baby. I'd pick Bob [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=499.4s)]
*  And that's wild, you know use a black baby when I'm a cutie [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=503.9s)]
*  Yeah saying paper rocks black baby like maybe wins every time dude, but you do paper Bobby black baby, dude, Bobby [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=507.02s)]
*  Bobby beats black baby sometimes man [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=514.66s)]
*  So I agree I think he's definitely that [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=518.1s)]
*  He's that tamagotchi. He's one step past that tamagotchi. He's like the shitting tamagotchi, you know, he's like the [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=521.66s)]

*  I think Richmond can use anything it can get right now [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=600.46s)]
*  But that's such a good question do I see a woman or a man? [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=604.82s)]
*  Sometimes you think I think once you get to know them you can tell if it's about love or not, you know [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=609.34s)]
*  I think that kind of happens, you know, I want to know what you thought when you first met me or even I thought you [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=613.54s)]
*  Guys met online. I mean for sure [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=619.86s)]
*  For sure because that's what I thought and you're right. We did because I lived in a I lived an hour away from here [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=623.18s)]

*  I don't think it was I never thought nothing bad [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=642.1s)]
*  Like what would I even think that could be bad like you got attacked by or something you were in a [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=645.7s)]
*  I [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=649.98s)]
*  Always I always wonder like like, you know when you try to again, it's a calculation thing [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=651.1800000000001s)]
*  Like oh she has to she has to be really stupid or she has to be this or she has to have really bad breath [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=656.22s)]
*  Or her her pussy is made of you know has teeth in it [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=661.98s)]
*  Like I don't know like what dudes think like when they try to weigh out why I would be with [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=665.36s)]
*  Little munchkin. Look, I I mean I love Bobby's one of the best, you know, Bobby's one of the best comedians that I he's one of the most [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=671.6800000000001s)]
*  Bobby's one of the most entertaining man that I've ever known [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=680.32s)]
*  So I could easily see [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=683.8000000000001s)]
*  Why a woman would like him? I like him. I'm not even a woman [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=686.2s)]
*  So I could easily see if I was a woman [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=690.76s)]
*  Why wouldn't why wouldn't I still like him I would still like him I think I would not I [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=693.96s)]
*  Don't think I'd have sex with Bobby. I would feel uncomfortable having sex with Bobby. He reminds me of like kind of like a [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=699.6s)]
*  But that's me. I'm also a man and he's neither one of us is a gay man [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=706.24s)]
*  So I think what I'm trying to say is that I didn't think anything bad of you at all. I thought oh [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=711.1600000000001s)]
*  Wow, Bobby met this girl probably online, you know because he doesn't go out and do anything [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=716.64s)]
*  So that's the only reason I thought that I thought either that he must have met her online or he got like a I [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=722.0s)]
*  Don't want to say like a postmates or somebody got a post that you showed up, you know [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=728.3199999999999s)]
*  We got hella lucky off a burrito like that's what I was thinking [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=731.8399999999999s)]
*  and haha [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=736.12s)]
*  so [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=737.92s)]
*  That's all I thought and then I just thought oh, this is awesome. You know, I'm glad that Bobby has somebody that's really cool and [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=739.24s)]
*  And [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=745.0799999999999s)]
*  Then it's also I mean you're just nice to look at you remind me of like the if they met a female female jungle book [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=746.28s)]
*  Who would be in it? You know, okay. Yeah, if they had a female mogul, you know, not too far off from that if they had [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=751.8399999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I don't know what the name would be. I don't know what female mo. I don't know what mogul II means [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=758.16s)]
*  What does mogul II mean? Can you look that up? Yeah, isn't he South Asian? [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=762.52s)]
*  So yeah, cuz there was a tiger involved Bagheera, right? Yeah, oh no sure con so it had to have been Indian [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=765.36s)]
*  Yeah, sure. The gear was the panther and then blue is the bear. Yeah [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=772.1s)]
*  Mowgli means wild child Wow child. So I think I thought I'd use like a female mogul II type [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=777.5s)]
*  And then I didn't know anything else, you know, Bobby, I don't see Bobby super much. So he's kind of secretive [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=782.88s)]
*  You know, he's like a spy that's not doing a good job, but it's still being a spy [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=789.4200000000001s)]
*  He's hard to get to know. Yeah, he really is hard to get to know, you know [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=794.38s)]
*  And I know that you know, I think I suffer from some of the same things he does [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=797.8199999999999s)]
*  So I think I'm also hard to get to know and so I recognize that about him and he's also [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=801.98s)]
*  It's kind of like the blessing and a curse of having so much [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=807.14s)]
*  Like [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=812.3399999999999s)]
*  There's so much going on with but there's like it's adult ADHD [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=814.22s)]
*  It's an it's also like a living form of it like never has adult ADHD. Usually it's non-transferable [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=818.26s)]
*  Bobby it's like oh my god [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=824.66s)]

*  he's like this archipelago of [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=836.6999999999999s)]
*  of like [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=839.74s)]
*  Bullshit and like Claire's boutique. Is that right tivity and like [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=841.4599999999999s)]

*  nudity and you know, you know everything's just this thing of everything and [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=848.9s)]
*  so it's [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=854.6999999999999s)]
*  It's very easy to be [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=856.5799999999999s)]
*  Enamored by him, but also you're so it's he's so engaging in such a character [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=859.1s)]
*  that [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=864.8199999999999s)]
*  It's almost you want to see so much you want so much of whatever it is [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=866.5799999999999s)]
*  That I could imagine if I were him that it's hard to be a regular person behind it [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=871.26s)]
*  I think so or within it especially why would you be a regular person when [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=875.92s)]
*  Whatever else you are which is also you is so [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=881.0600000000001s)]

*  We get into that a lot because it's like, you know with me like the rule is like you got to take your mask off [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=889.74s)]
*  At the door because I don't really care for like the bells and whistles [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=895.6600000000001s)]
*  I don't care for him to make me laugh. Like that's like I already know all these things [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=899.58s)]
*  I know who he is to write the public [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=903.62s)]
*  Like and I think that's where I feel very blessed to know a part of him that no one will ever see [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=906.26s)]
*  Oh, yes, he is just a sweetheart and the kindest man most generous person like I've ever met I think yeah [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=913.02s)]
*  Yeah, he's always surprisingly kind of he's so he I find him to be surprisingly kind at times [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=921.62s)]
*  Yeah, but he has a hard time when you need him. He's there. He has a hard time [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=927.04s)]
*  I'm [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=931.4599999999999s)]
*  Not putting on he feels like he has to be [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=932.6999999999999s)]
*  Something every time he walks out the door. You have to put on a performance and I'm like, well, no [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=936.74s)]
*  You don't have to not around like your friends, but all his friends are you guys like people that you know? [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=941.5799999999999s)]
*  You have to be yeah [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=946.9s)]
*  And then you also create this world of podcasts and where you're always doing so, you know [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=948.06s)]
*  It's so then that kind of like doesn't perpetuate it. It's still [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=951.3s)]
*  Do you get confused? [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=955.3399999999999s)]
*  Do I get confused about like? [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=957.14s)]
*  You know cuz we podcast so much and so many hours of ourselves you're out there [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=959.86s)]
*  Do you ever get confused about like who you are outside of this like in terms of like being who you like? [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=963.54s)]

*  Kaila and we had a question that came in from Oh God right? Yeah [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=976.26s)]
*  Hey, Kalila, my name is Ryan [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=980.34s)]
*  My question for Kaila is does Bobby joke around with you a lot at home? [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=982.46s)]
*  And if he does is it easy to tell when he's choking? Oh, yeah, let me know gang gang blood stuff [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=986.98s)]
*  Gang gang is it hard to tell when he's choking did he say he said always choking by the way [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=992.9000000000001s)]
*  I could always the plumbing on the guy is backed up. It's backed up. It's back down. It's [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=997.6800000000001s)]
*  It's like go get him bored out. There's two things that happen every day in the house multiple times a day [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=1005.2600000000001s)]
*  He trips on the stairs. Yeah, and there's a big owl [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=1010.32s)]
*  I stubbed my toe every fucking day and there's always a distant [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=1012.98s)]
*  Sound of choking. Oh, yeah, and there's always me saying are you okay? [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=1018.02s)]
*  And then him getting mad like this is just how I eat [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=1021.9s)]
*  You don't not everyone chokes every time they eat [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=1025.46s)]
*  Yeah, it's a real art. You know, I mean the guy that's a thing and that's why I go back to he's on the cusp of [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=1028.78s)]
*  I don't want to see he's just a risky [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=1035.94s)]
*  He's a writ. He is he is [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=1039.42s)]
*  He's a shooting star, you know, he is a star and sometimes stars shoot too far and they burn explode [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=1041.38s)]
*  It's just risky. You know I'm saying risky he's choking already in this conversation. He's choking is dysentery [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=1048.5s)]

*  Um [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=1363.82s)]
*  I don't know how to answer this question besides saying like what can I do? [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=1368.3s)]
*  Do you stay out of it? Do you engage with it? [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=1372.14s)]
*  Some people engage in the beginning I did because it's like you can't help but like wonder what people are saying about you [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=1374.22s)]
*  But it's like there's I have no control of it. I only have control of like my friends and family. So [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=1380.38s)]
*  Unfortunately, they are bad. And if I were to jump into that it would crush my soul [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=1387.16s)]
*  Oh, yeah, I can't live there. I was disheartening in there, you know, it gets real disheartening down in the internet [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=1393.02s)]
*  So when you think about like if something ever happened to bobby, right? [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=1398.46s)]
*  Are you going back? Huh? We're not going back. I just want to finish the conversation [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=1402.54s)]

*  Well, any of those things could happen because philippines is part of the pacific rim rim of fire. Louisiana is not [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=1411.26s)]
*  I know that's what i'm saying. So you guys [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=1417.66s)]
*  just the life expectancy [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=1419.98s)]
*  I think that's the big thing when you see bobby you say oh how long well [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=1422.46s)]
*  He looks like he's still 20 years old. So you have to take that into consideration something he's doing [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=1426.14s)]
*  Because there are other asians who are 50 that don't look as young as him. That's true [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=1432.46s)]
*  So, I don't know if the recklessness and the lack of care maybe equates to lack of stress [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=1436.78s)]
*  I bet it does probably or um, he seems stress free kind of [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=1443.34s)]
*  He's neurotic, but he's stress free I don't I don't know if that's possible, but it somehow is right now, um [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=1447.82s)]

*  You can even say because he also looks kidnappable a child a child predator [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=1460.86s)]
*  No one wants those kidneys. He's like he's a smoker, but they don't want him for the kidneys. They want him for the sex [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=1466.3s)]

*  This guy could be indian [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=2126.88s)]
*  Hey, what's up, do you play from deerfield beach? [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=2129.84s)]
*  Um question for auntie. Kalyla. I'm auntie. What's your favorite part about doing the bloodbath podcast? [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=2133.1200000000003s)]
*  With the girls versus tiger belly like what are some of the different things that you enjoy with that? [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=2140.48s)]
*  Also, I think that you should rescue some cats as well as dogs. I know you've been getting a lot of dogs [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=2146.0800000000004s)]
*  Cats need love too [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=2151.84s)]
*  Bring home bobby some cats [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=2153.44s)]
*  Can keep the cats on one floor and the dogs on another well like that [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=2156.0s)]
*  I like that guy. It's almost like the sheiks or something in um [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=2160.96s)]
*  Istanbul or saudi arabia their wives the different wives get different floors of the home [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=2165.82s)]
*  First wife where it goes where the first wife I think probably upstairs [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=2172.08s)]
*  First wife is probably exhausted wants nothing to do but wants the wealth and the perks of being the first wife, right? [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=2177.04s)]
*  So I think they probably get the hierarchy. So she has no, um blowjob duties. None of the other stuff. She's tired [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=2183.84s)]
*  That's a young girl's yeah young girl's game. Yeah, um [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=2190.56s)]
*  the difference between doing a podcast with bobby is that like I feel [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=2194.56s)]
*  I don't know like [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=2198.8s)]
*  I feel angrier [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=2200.96s)]
*  When i'm in tiger belly. Mm [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=2202.96s)]
*  Because we just have bobby and I have that sort of like antagonistic sort of like [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=2205.1200000000003s)]
*  Rapport, I guess if you can call it that yeah, yeah with bloodbath. It's like they're girls, right? I feel a little bit [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=2209.76s)]
*  Like I can play around. I don't know. I don't know how to explain it. But um, i'm definitely two versions of myself. I have [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=2217.44s)]
*  Absolutely two versions of myself on those podcasts. Yeah [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=2224.32s)]
*  Yeah, I can relate to that. I think it's the same for me with this and uh king of the sting [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=2227.44s)]
*  It doesn't feel like me it feels like me but it's just like a crazy version. It's like i'm at a nightclub, right? [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=2230.96s)]
*  Right, you know, it's like i'm at a shitty nightclub in jacksonville, you know [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=2236.96s)]
*  Jacksonville bob why do you why does everyone have no it's actually tampa bobby always has stories about nightclubs in tampa in florida [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=2241.42s)]
*  Oh, there's a cuz there's a they'll put a nightclub anywhere there, you know [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=2248.72s)]
*  You'll have like a olive garden then you have a nightclub right next to the zoning in that state [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=2251.6s)]
*  Is unbelievable. You have a mortuary [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=2256.64s)]
*  Next to a strip club next to they're selling bass boats. You know, it's like [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=2259.3599999999997s)]
*  I mean you just can't even decide if you want to die or freaking, you know, get up early for some redfish [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=2263.84s)]
*  it's just like [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=2268.32s)]
*  The choices there they just [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=2270.16s)]
*  There's no differentiating between anything. They'll have a kindergarten [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=2272.24s)]
*  Um right next to a graveyard, you know, they just don't there's no [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=2276.32s)]
*  Big plan I think in florida and I think that's what florida was supposed to be [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=2280.48s)]
*  It was like it's just kind of like this catch-all [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=2284.64s)]
*  Of the united states, you know [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=2287.2799999999997s)]
*  but [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=2290.32s)]
*  Um, I wonder what it would be like if you were my second [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=2291.28s)]
*  If I was your second husband, yeah, you planted this seed in my head [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=2295.6000000000004s)]
*  And you know, I have lived with two men before no, I didn't know that [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=2299.1200000000003s)]
*  Yeah before I met bobby my last relationship was with two people. We lived together with two white men. No [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=2302.5600000000004s)]
*  One was filipino salvadorian. Oh, wow, and the other was he was a black guy and phil sales, huh? [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=2308.2400000000002s)]
*  Damn and a brother. Yeah [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=2314.32s)]
*  Wow [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=2317.0400000000004s)]
*  Why why do you what uh, and what are you what are you doing there you were just living with him were you paying rent? [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=2319.2s)]
*  Yes, I was paying rent. Okay [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=2325.36s)]
*  But wife number one, no wife number one boyfriend number one number two had slept in the same room as me [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=2327.7599999999998s)]
*  The number two because he came in a little later into the relationship was um in a different room. Who was that the brother? [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=2334.4s)]
*  Brother of my the black guy the gentleman black gentleman. No. No, he was my five-year relationship [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=2341.36s)]
*  Oh, he was the he was the number one he was my number one you guys brought on that salvadorian a pinch hit [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=2346.16s)]
*  Yeah [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=2350.08s)]
*  Yeah, huh that rafael palmero [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=2351.8399999999997s)]
*  You know what i'm saying? I like it [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=2354.72s)]
*  Look, that's wild. I mean, I wonder if we're getting more into stuff like that [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=2356.7999999999997s)]
*  You know [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=2360.56s)]
*  I think one thing is disappearing a little bit in the world or at least there's they're leading us to believe it is disappearing as like [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=2360.7999999999997s)]
*  ownership [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=2367.18s)]
*  things [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=2368.64s)]
*  um, I you know, I while I agree with that I do think that [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=2369.8399999999997s)]
*  Because I have friends who are in open relationships throuples all of these things for me personally, it's emotionally exhausting [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=2374.8s)]
*  I could never be in that position again because I thought you know my young self I was young I was in my 20s [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=2381.92s)]
*  I was like, this is so exciting. You know, I get to have sex with two men at one time [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=2387.28s)]
*  But then there's life after that and then now you have to deal with feelings [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=2392.4s)]
*  There's you know, you have to cook an extra batch of food. Oh, yeah, like there are things logistically [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=2397.6000000000004s)]
*  It's exhausting. Oh, yeah, so the sex for the 10 minute sex is just but a blip in that entire picture [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=2403.86s)]
*  Yeah, I mean you almost need a damn merchant marine [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=2410.7400000000002s)]
*  It sounds like to help keep the you know, like to supplement that, you know the food everything the logistics. It's definitely a lot. Yeah. Um [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=2412.82s)]
*  Yeah, I can't imagine. I don't think I wonder if I could have I can't keep one girlfriend [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=2419.94s)]
*  I don't know if I could keep two wives, you know [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=2424.7400000000002s)]
*  But I would have to just get really really honest with them and say look this is what's going on [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=2428.02s)]
*  You know [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=2432.66s)]
*  And that's where I kind of struggle with women is just that communication upfront the upfront communication. They call it [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=2433.78s)]
*  What do you mean? Like just telling them how things are probably going to be upfront somewhat [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=2439.22s)]
*  Well, why don't why do you have to tell someone upfront? [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=2444.34s)]
*  Why can't they just why can't you figure it out as you go because [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=2447.3s)]
*  What you're saying today might not apply three months down the line. Certainly not how you feel [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=2451.38s)]
*  Right. Yeah, not how you feel but just like some of your just be your behaviors that sort of stuff, you know [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=2456.34s)]
*  Again, but that changes right so it's like I don't need a disclaimer right out the gate [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=2461.2200000000003s)]
*  I just don't need you to lie. I don't like declarations upfront because I think declarations are a red flag [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=2466.82s)]
*  I am this guy. I'm this guy. I'm this and don't tell me who you are. Just like let me find out who you are slowly [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=2472.34s)]
*  You know, because that's that's more like applicable to like that's ultimately what's going to you know, um [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=2478.5s)]
*  That's how i'm going to decide yeah [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=2487.54s)]
*  What if I just wish I had like a fan foot to give a woman before we met, you know [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=2490.1s)]
*  What would that pamphlet say? [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=2494.02s)]
*  I would probably say good morning at the top for sure [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=2496.02s)]
*  And then let me think it would say good morning and then it would say [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=2499.94s)]
*  Thanks for reading this [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=2504.66s)]
*  I am happy that you're here [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=2506.9s)]
*  And i'm looking forward to the possibilities [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=2509.46s)]
*  I would like you to know that I don't communicate super well a lot of times [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=2514.1s)]
*  But i'm trying to work on it. So if you see opportunities to help me work on it, please help me [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=2520.02s)]
*  um [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=2526.58s)]
*  What else I have i'm a one-stripe white belt [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=2528.5s)]
*  Also in case anything gets out of hand [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=2532.18s)]
*  I can't [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=2535.3s)]
*  I I can't definitely help but I could try to help [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=2537.06s)]
*  um [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=2541.46s)]
*  What else? Uh [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=2542.5s)]
*  I'll do my best with sex not making any big promises [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=2544.5s)]
*  um [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=2549.2200000000003s)]
*  I like to be indoors and outdoors. I like to go out of town and stay in town [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=2550.58s)]
*  And I like to eat two meals a day [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=2556.58s)]
*  Those don't seem like difficult things that someone would have to deal with except for the communication part [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=2559.38s)]
*  But what do you have trouble communicating like feelings things matters of the heart? [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=2564.82s)]
*  I think so. I think I do have some stuff like that, you know [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=2569.94s)]
*  so that's why I think I just need like a [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=2572.58s)]
*  I think I just yeah, I just need to have I just need to step up and do better at it, you know [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=2576.1800000000003s)]
*  Okay, like when was the last time you've? [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=2581.78s)]
*  Been vulnerable and said like, you know [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=2584.9s)]
*  I love you like when was the last time you've ever like been that way with a woman like have you felt? [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=2587.78s)]
*  Extremely vulnerable around a woman. It's probably been a little while. I've had some vulnerable conversations [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=2594.7200000000003s)]
*  But I tend to I think then kind of not try to have them again sometimes, you know [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=2600.12s)]
*  Even though I think that it's good. You don't feel freed from it. You feel exhausted or do you feel like [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=2604.7599999999998s)]
*  What being vulnerable? Yeah [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=2610.04s)]
*  um [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=2612.12s)]
*  No, I feel freed from it. It's just hard to get to that place to do it sometimes. It's hard to really [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=2613.16s)]
*  Just do it, you know, it's hard to do it [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=2618.92s)]

*  I think I've never been in like a relationship where I knew you could do that [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=2664.12s)]
*  so I think it's harder now with a lot of people you meet because it's like [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=2666.68s)]
*  I don't know man, like people are really reckless with other people's emotions when it comes to dating and situationships [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=2670.7599999999998s)]

*  Similar to oh the bobby the the vein of being bobby. There's something really oh that androgynous kind of like [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=2743.24s)]
*  Because jamar was kind of like he kind of wears whatever he says. He's just like the free. He's a free bird [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=2751.64s)]

*  The type it's just you have I mean, I just love the type of men that you love [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=2777.8s)]
*  And I think it's good [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=2783.56s)]

*  I just feel like if you see a woman with a man [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=2789.08s)]
*  Then you think as a man you think? [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=2792.76s)]
*  I think the first thing you think oh that guy's not going to be around longer. He is going to be around long [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=2795.0s)]
*  I think that's just a natural thing. That's like nature [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=2799.56s)]
*  Maybe that's what you and I think because we come from old daddies, right? Right? [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=2802.12s)]

*  Dad's dying a lot. Yeah, right. That's true. I didn't think about that [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=2812.52s)]
*  And I think just just from a genetic standpoint [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=2817.16s)]
*  I just don't think you and I would should have kids together [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=2820.2s)]
*  Two [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=2823.64s)]
*  Old spermies. We shouldn't we could have a kid that's like 60 years old [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=2824.92s)]
*  How great would that be [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=2832.6s)]
*  Like a benjamin button, yeah, I think so. Yeah, I think you and I can make one. Yeah. Oh, that'd be amazing [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=2835.96s)]

*  And it's brian gallin [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=2845.64s)]
*  That would be the best [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=2850.04s)]
*  Career post islands he would do it just to have a new credit in town [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=2852.84s)]
*  Oh, I was on season one of kalyla's vagina [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=2859.48s)]
*  And bobby I want you to know I I look we're just having a conversation here [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=2864.7599999999998s)]
*  You don't think anything's been inappropriate here. Do you? No [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=2868.44s)]
*  He would laugh at all of this. See that's where I feel sometimes like scared about talking about stuff [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=2872.36s)]
*  Because sometimes that is don't I think in the world no one ever told me what's appropriate or what's inappropriate [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=2875.88s)]
*  Yeah, but we've known each other long enough to know like it's all [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=2880.62s)]
*  You know, it's all love. It's just [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=2884.2999999999997s)]

*  Um, no, but sometimes like I do wish that bobby would be a little bit more jealous [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=2891.58s)]
*  He just says he has no jealousy for me like at all and I think that's why i'm obsessed with him [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=2896.94s)]
*  Oh, I would be jealous. I think [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=2901.74s)]
*  I would get a tattoo on myself jealous man [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=2904.54s)]
*  For you if you wanted me to maybe if you didn't want me to I wouldn't [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=2907.1800000000003s)]
*  And I would let you have the font. I don't do well with jealous people. I get really turned off by it [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=2911.34s)]

*  Then it's like I just become a home body and I I don't know [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=2921.82s)]
*  There's something really attractive about that when somebody shows absolute faith and confidence in you. Yeah. Yeah [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=2926.0600000000004s)]

*  um [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=2971.02s)]
*  you know, it's starting to seem like [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=2972.78s)]
*  That house is just becoming like a dog pound [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=2975.1800000000003s)]
*  So many questions about dogs. Leave me alone. I feel like [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=2978.54s)]
*  You've been dodging the answer to this question [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=2982.1400000000003s)]
*  Gang gang have I been dodging this? [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=2984.78s)]
*  He's onward brother right there. I love his attitude onward brother. You go get it, huh? [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=2987.82s)]
*  You go get it dude [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=2992.3s)]
*  I feel like i've been very clear about where I stand on having children [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=2993.74s)]
*  I have I do not know anything about this the same reason that you fear. He's just gonna perish [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=2997.58s)]
*  I don't fear it. I think you alone have said vomiting [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=3003.02s)]
*  diarrhea [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=3007.64s)]
*  Fire being attacked by a lobster. Yeah, so those a lot of things people don't deal with on a regular basis [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=3008.86s)]
*  Also, I went to his birthday one time eating very dangerous food. That was filipino food and the restaurant was great [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=3014.7s)]
*  There was fish poisoning. It was right by the interstate. There was no fish. It was a steakhouse [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=3020.8599999999997s)]
*  Well some of the steak had fins on it [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=3024.8599999999997s)]
*  So it was water steak [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=3029.2599999999998s)]
*  so anyway, i'm just saying there's that's all i'm saying is as a as a as a as a natural being if you see [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=3031.1s)]
*  A woman and a a male it doesn't matter the ages or anything you one of the first thoughts is okay [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=3039.3399999999997s)]
*  Is that man gonna survive with that? Is that man gonna survive? It's just a survival thing [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=3045.5s)]
*  So I think that's what if I saw you with some like you said some six foot six rugby guy [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=3050.7s)]
*  You almost feel like oh, there's no chance at that that guy's probably gonna survive that guy could probably beat fire [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=3057.02s)]
*  That guy could beat everything no because short people live longer [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=3062.2999999999997s)]
*  Right, but I think that's with short people. Yes [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=3065.8999999999996s)]
*  If bobby's a safe short man [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=3069.02s)]
*  Wearing safe attire wearing things that are reflective clothing [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=3071.74s)]
*  But bobby he wears a lot of reflective clothing [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=3076.38s)]
*  You know that he always wears a construction shirt that no one understands why he wears but he wears it all the time [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=3080.86s)]
*  Oh, I do he's under he's under construction like no one else i've ever met and his shoes are always shining [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=3086.54s)]
*  There's always a reflector on there [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=3091.98s)]
*  But also i've seen him drive off many times into the night with no headlights on [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=3093.82s)]
*  And he will literally while it's loading shine his candy crush game at the road in order to see where he's going [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=3098.78s)]
*  So let's just say he lives a risky lifestyle. Can we just say he lives a risky? Thank you [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=3105.98s)]
*  And that is the answer to this guy's question. I [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=3111.9s)]
*  Well, it's compounded it's a couple things but that's definitely one of the reasons it's like I need a little bit more [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=3116.86s)]
*  I need him to prove that he's going to stay alive [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=3122.38s)]
*  And that he wants to stay alive like I don't want to be a single mom I don't [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=3127.26s)]
*  I don't want to be you know, if you are if you are a single mom [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=3131.98s)]
*  We definitely have a fund for single moms. We are more than willing to help you out every day. We want to let you know that [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=3135.02s)]
*  um [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=3139.98s)]
*  But so you so he needs to prove he's staying alive. Yeah [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=3140.94s)]
*  And what else has he started to display do you start to see some of those fatherly characteristics? [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=3144.38s)]
*  Because I notice one thing it's nice about bobby is [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=3148.62s)]
*  Like if I text bobby and say hey man, I need this I need you here. I need help. I need something [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=3151.9s)]
*  He will get back to me. Yes, if I text anything else [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=3157.82s)]
*  Nothing, nothing radio silence disappearing. He told me one time he asked he told me [[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=3161.66s)]
*  He had passed away once which I was like, well, you should have somebody else tell me [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=3167.1800000000003s)]

*  uh to get out of something but otherwise he is [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=3173.02s)]
*  It's odd. He's one of the most reliable guys in I know [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=3177.66s)]
*  he is and [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=3180.78s)]
*  The guy asked a question earlier like two questions before this about what it's like to live with him [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=3182.3s)]
*  And he's never not picked up a phone call. He's never not texted me back [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=3186.54s)]
*  Like he just has a bandwidth for very few people [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=3189.58s)]
*  But those people that he has a bandwidth for he really comes through for [[00:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=3193.18s)]
*  Um, but in terms of children, that's a whole nother ball game that that's another human's life [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=3196.94s)]
*  Um, he's very good with kids and but in five minutes spurts and having kids is not a five minute game [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=3201.74s)]
*  Like that is it's it's a lot and I take that stuff really really seriously. So, um, it's [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=3208.06s)]

*  That's something that we're working through but it's not out of the question. It's just [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=3222.7s)]
*  I just need just a little bit more [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=3226.7s)]
*  Yeah, I need to see that he wants to be alive for at the very least till the kid's 12 [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=3229.18s)]

*  Literally, the kid would be on the roof in that little attachment to the baby seat and bobby would be in the baby seat [[00:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=3247.1s)]
*  That's what i'm saying like or like he'd leave the baby at like the top of the car [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=3255.1s)]

*  So it's hard to relate a lot of times when they talk about it [[00:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=3407.58s)]
*  But the emotional side of it I can relate to tons [[00:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=3411.18s)]
*  It's like whenever they talk about how they're feeling in there [[00:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=3414.2999999999997s)]

*  Weird things about your life because I find them endearing when people learn about me [[01:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=4029.5s)]
*  But I think most women find them to be like a super turn-off [[01:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=4034.7799999999997s)]
*  And my buddies always tell me you should chill, you know, don't reveal who you really are [[01:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=4038.9399999999996s)]

*  He got a guy one of his friends to buy me flowers for valentine's day. Oh, that's good [[01:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=5700.0s)]
*  He didn't even hand him to me his friend handed them to me. Oh really? [[01:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=5704.959999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I think he had like alex george to like say hey dude, whatever i'll demo you right now [[01:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=5708.240000000001s)]
*  And he was playing video games. He was playing video games with alex and he was like, hey dude [[01:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=5712.72s)]
*  Can you go out to the first floor as you see and just bring it to my door? [[01:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=5717.52s)]
*  And that's how it that's that's that's the extent of the romance [[01:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=5722.8s)]
*  And I I think it comes from him not seeing it around in his life. Whereas I [[01:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=5726.64s)]
*  Just saw my dad [[01:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=5732.240000000001s)]
*  Just go all out for my mom really so it it hurts me a little bit [[01:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=5734.08s)]
*  and but it's you know [[01:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=5739.5199999999995s)]
*  There are other he makes up for it in other ways. What do you what would your dad do with your mom? [[01:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=5742.72s)]
*  He was just so devoted this is why I have a hard time [[01:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=5749.5199999999995s)]
*  This is what bobby and I struggle with because i'm like [[01:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=5752.5599999999995s)]
*  It's not that I want you to have a hundred percent romance have two percent. Yeah [[01:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=5755.12s)]
*  Something yeah, um [[01:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=5759.18s)]
*  But my dad would have dinner for my mom like cook for her write her poems like [[01:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=5762.14s)]
*  um [[01:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=5768.780000000001s)]
*  Wash her underwear [[01:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=5770.06s)]
*  Hang it up on, you know, just hand wash her clothes. You're talking about and when he was, you know [[01:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=5772.14s)]
*  My dad was really old but we didn't have a car when we our first couple years in america [[01:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=5777.26s)]
*  And my mom had to get to work. He would do something like this where he's like you don't take the bus today [[01:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=5782.780000000001s)]
*  He would call access vans because he was eligible for a senior ride [[01:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=5787.9s)]
*  And he would and mind you he he was a sick man and he was dying [[01:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=5792.86s)]
*  But he would order the access van get in the van with her to drop her off at work [[01:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=5796.54s)]
*  So she wouldn't have to take three buses there and then wait another hour at the at her work to go back in an access van [[01:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=5801.42s)]
*  But that doesn't seem like a lot but he was he he was in his late 70s at this point [[01:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=5808.3s)]
*  But things like that I saw [[01:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=5815.18s)]
*  Mattered to me. Yeah [[01:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=5817.82s)]
*  And had such a big effect on my life and bobby had didn't see that [[01:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=5819.66s)]
*  So I offer him grace in that way because he wasn't as lucky to have it in his life like I did. Yeah [[01:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=5824.22s)]
*  Yeah, that's pretty powerful man, I remember [[01:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=5834.0599999999995s)]
*  Yeah, my parents didn't have like a lot of stuff like that. I saw my parents kiss one time at like a birthday [[01:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=5836.7s)]
*  How'd you feel and it was like my dad like kissed my mom on the head? [[01:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=5841.9s)]
*  Up here or back here back here. Oh standing behind her. It was okay. It was fine. I mean how much younger was your mom? [[01:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=5845.820000000001s)]
*  Uh, she's 38 years [[01:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=5852.38s)]
*  38 years younger. Yeah, my mom was 36 years younger. Wow [[01:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=5854.540000000001s)]
*  So we're twins. Yeah [[01:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=5859.660000000001s)]
*  Yeah, symbiotic [[01:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=5861.740000000001s)]
*  Did your dad? Um, did your mom carry on relationships with other men? [[01:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=5863.26s)]
*  At all while they were seeing each other, you mean? Yeah. No, she didn't I think after they split up [[01:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=5868.780000000001s)]
*  she had a she ended up meeting a man, but [[01:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=5873.42s)]
*  Yeah, she they just I don't know my dad always slept on the couch like they just didn't have a vibe, you know [[01:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=5877.66s)]
*  So I think even now when I think about like being in separate places being in separate rooms like that kind of stuff feels normal [[01:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=5882.7s)]
*  To me, I guess you know [[01:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=5888.22s)]
*  I think you don't realize how much those little things when you're a kid really like [[01:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=5889.42s)]
*  Kind of resonate with you. They do discomfort of like [[01:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=5893.18s)]
*  I think like yeah, maybe my mom had said such discomfort with my dad being around. I don't know [[01:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=5897.1s)]
*  Maybe you're a lot more similar to bobby in that regard because while my parents were really um [[01:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=5901.9800000000005s)]
*  Were were very different ages [[01:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=5908.38s)]
*  There was love there. There was respect there was mutual devotion [[01:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=5911.26s)]
*  and um [[01:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=5915.9800000000005s)]
*  From a distance it could it looked like a 90-day fiance situation gone wrong like [[01:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=5917.58s)]
*  Rich old guy because my dad was a rich guy. Oh, damn went back to the philippines got himself like a young Philippine housey [[01:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=5923.5s)]
*  That wasn't the case. My dad eventually lost all his money and my mom never [[01:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=5929.1s)]
*  Left his side till the day he died all her friends were like, oh does he have an inheritance? [[01:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=5933.900000000001s)]
*  And she's not a single fucking dime because he was a poor gambler. He fucked up all his investments [[01:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=5938.3s)]
*  But she they were devoted to each other [[01:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=5943.34s)]
*  and that's where [[01:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=5945.740000000001s)]
*  It becomes a situation where bobby doesn't require certain things in a relationship and I do [[01:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=5947.740000000001s)]
*  Because I yearn for that love they have like I yearn for that [[01:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=5953.58s)]
*  But it's nice that you're willing to at least are you it seems like you're brave enough to try and make that [[01:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=5958.38s)]
*  For yourself, you know, even if it's not coming in 100 from the other person exactly like you want it [[01:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=5963.42s)]
*  It can't though that that's the right [[01:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=5968.3s)]
*  my [[01:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=5970.46s)]
*  I can't require bobby to give me [[01:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=5971.5s)]
*  He can't be my one-stop shop for everything. Right? I have friends for that. I have a sister for that [[01:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=5975.1s)]
*  I have a mother for that like my emotional needs [[01:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=5979.9s)]
*  You know don't have to be tended to by this man like I have a whole community for that [[01:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=5983.82s)]
*  Um, so in that regard I do tell him like hey up your romance game a little bit [[01:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=5989.5s)]
*  Yeah, I understand that you didn't grow up with christmas trees or love that you got beat up a lot [[01:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=5994.62s)]
*  But this is what I need and this is what I know you're able to give so just give that two percent [[01:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=5999.5s)]
*  I'm happy with that two percent. Right? So we're working on it managing expectations. Wow [[01:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgM-CM-K50g&t=6005.259999999999s)]
