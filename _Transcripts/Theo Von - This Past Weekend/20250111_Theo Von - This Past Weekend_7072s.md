*  Yeah. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=156.44s)]
*  Yeah, I don't want to do an impression of it. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=157.28s)]
*  I'll fuck it up, but I like it over there. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=158.85999999999999s)]
*  It's beautiful. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=160.9s)]
*  Would you like, was there? [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=162.26s)]
*  I think that it's like, [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=163.9s)]
*  it's one of the most beautiful places, [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=165.7s)]
*  but it's like very lightly populated. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=168.34s)]
*  I almost don't want to talk about it because it's so cool. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=170.94s)]
*  Cause there's not a lot of people there. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=173.42s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=174.62s)]
*  Cause also there's like some shit there that's so old. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=175.46s)]
*  They had some guide stones on this property. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=177.86s)]
*  And they said, I go, how old are these things? [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=181.78s)]
*  They're like thousands of years old. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=183.82s)]
*  We don't even know. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=185.02s)]
*  Don't know who put them there. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=185.86s)]
*  Don't know why they're there. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=187.02s)]
*  So these like 4,000, 5,000 year old stones [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=188.34s)]
*  that are sticking out of the ground, [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=191.70000000000002s)]
*  they have a stone circle there that's older than Stonehenge. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=192.86s)]
*  Hmm. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=196.06s)]
*  It's crazy. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=196.9s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=197.74s)]
*  Yeah, Stonehenge is crazy, dude. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=198.78s)]
*  I remember when in school they would teach us like, [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=200.14000000000001s)]
*  Stonehenge, it's crazy. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=202.73999999999998s)]
*  Who knows what happened, you know? [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=204.5s)]
*  Like Smurfs, aliens, [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=206.22s)]
*  like they had all this crazy shit they would teach you. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=207.61999999999998s)]
*  And then- [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=209.61999999999998s)]
*  They taught you about that in school? [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=210.45999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=211.45999999999998s)]
*  Smurfs? [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=212.29999999999998s)]
*  Or just everybody didn't know what it was about, right? [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=213.14s)]
*  But then- [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=215.57999999999998s)]
*  Stonehenge is by Smurfs? [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=216.42s)]
*  Is that it? [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=217.78s)]
*  Jamie, did you get that in Ohio? [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=218.61999999999998s)]
*  Did they teach you that? [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=220.22s)]
*  I learned about it all at the same time like him, probably. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=221.06s)]
*  Yeah, this is during the eighties, bro, early nineties. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=222.5s)]
*  And, but then we went there one time, [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=225.45999999999998s)]
*  we were touring and we drove by [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=227.78s)]
*  and literally they had an exit for Stonehenge. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=229.38s)]
*  And it was just right there. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=231.82s)]
*  It was like a rest area. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=232.98s)]
*  It was just like right off the highway. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=234.22s)]
*  And when you went there, was it impressive? [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=236.54s)]
*  No, it was like, I was impressed [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=238.34s)]
*  because I'd learned they didn't give a fuck. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=239.98s)]
*  There's like people over there just like changing their kids [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=241.62s)]
*  in front of it and stuff on the ground. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=244.26s)]
*  Like people didn't give a shit. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=245.66s)]
*  And you'd walk up to it and touch it, right? [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=247.5s)]
*  It's right there, dude. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=249.26s)]
*  They had like a sign that was like, [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=250.3s)]
*  I don't even think it said, please don't touch. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=253.22s)]
*  It was like just something more vague than that. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=254.62s)]
*  Did you ever see the Georgia Guidestones? [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=257.58s)]
*  Mm-mm. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=259.38s)]
*  The Georgia Guidestones were this thing that, [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=260.74s)]
*  I don't know if they know who built it. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=264.62s)]
*  Do they know who funded that thing? [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=266.38s)]
*  I don't think so. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=267.7s)]
*  So they were funded. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=269.5s)]
*  The Georgia Guidestones, somebody spent a lot of money [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=270.78000000000003s)]
*  to make these giant stone statues [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=273.26s)]
*  with the guides to how to keep a civilization intact. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=277.1s)]
*  And then, somebody- Oh, like the rules? [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=282.46000000000004s)]
*  Yeah. Oh, wow. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=283.98s)]
*  Yeah, it's written in a bunch of different languages. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=285.34000000000003s)]
*  So what is it? [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=288.7s)]
*  So somebody blew it up, man. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=289.82s)]
*  No. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=291.62s)]
*  Oh yeah, let's sit down at the bottom. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=292.46s)]
*  Somebody blew it up and then they decided [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=294.62s)]
*  after the person blew up part of it to destroy it all. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=298.14s)]
*  Which I don't understand that logic. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=301.54s)]
*  Why they wouldn't just rebuild it? [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=303.34s)]
*  Why didn't you just rebuild it? [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=304.74s)]
*  So a mysterious monument meant to guide [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=306.26s)]
*  into an age of reason was destroyed [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=308.62s)]
*  after an apparent bombing. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=310.46s)]
*  And that right there is like a perfect example [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=312.34s)]
*  of existence, it feels like. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=314.46s)]
*  How about just leave it there? [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=316.02s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=317.46s)]
*  Okay, June of 1979, a man going by the pseudonym [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=318.42s)]
*  of R.C. Christian approached [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=322.5s)]
*  the Elberton Granite Finishing Company [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=324.5s)]
*  with the task of building a monument. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=327.02000000000004s)]
*  He said that no one was ever to know his true identity [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=328.46000000000004s)]
*  or the group that he was representing. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=331.06s)]
*  Or the group that he, of the group, [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=333.66s)]
*  or that of the group that he was representing. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=335.54s)]
*  He seemed to have an endless supply of money [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=337.62s)]
*  to fund the project. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=339.18s)]
*  And by the terms of the legal contract, [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=340.54s)]
*  all plans had to be destroyed after completion [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=342.54s)]
*  and all information about him was held from the public. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=344.86s)]
*  The stones were finished in 1980. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=348.22s)]
*  They carry a tablet in the front, proclaiming, [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=351.34000000000003s)]
*  let these be guide stones to an age of reason. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=353.14s)]
*  Engraved in the stones are 10 guidelines meant [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=357.26s)]
*  to reestablish the planet and society, [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=359.7s)]
*  perhaps after an apocalypse. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=362.1s)]
*  They're written in eight different languages, [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=363.90000000000003s)]
*  English, Spanish, Swahili, Hindu, Hebrew, Arabic, [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=365.90000000000003s)]
*  Chinese, and Russian, amongst other commandments, [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=369.34000000000003s)]
*  preached to maintain humanity under 500 million [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=372.78000000000003s)]
*  in perpetual balance with nature. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=376.62s)]
*  Wow. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=378.21999999999997s)]
*  Rule, passion, faith, tradition, [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=379.46s)]
*  and all things with tempered reason. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=381.65999999999997s)]
*  Balance personal rights with social duties. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=384.26s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=386.82s)]
*  Be not a cancer on the earth, leave room for nature. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=387.65999999999997s)]
*  Wow. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=390.41999999999996s)]
*  Solid laws. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=391.26s)]
*  Yeah, do you think? [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=392.97999999999996s)]
*  That's solid. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=393.9s)]
*  Yeah, it seems like a great plan. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=394.74s)]
*  Do you think that humanity is supposed to reach [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=396.7s)]
*  like this place where we kind of get it all figured out, [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=399.38s)]
*  or do you think it's always just this constant ebb and flow [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=401.58s)]
*  of like step forward, step back, [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=404.9s)]
*  or two steps forward, step back? [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=409.06s)]
*  We were talking about on the podcast, [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=410.65999999999997s)]
*  like what's happening in terms of like people [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=412.85999999999996s)]
*  slowly turning into genderless aliens. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=415.26s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=418.21999999999997s)]
*  I think that's probably really what's going on. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=419.06s)]
*  I don't think humanity ever gets together. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=422.41999999999996s)]
*  I think humanity stops being humanity. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=424.85999999999996s)]
*  Because I think what keeps us from getting it together, [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=427.78s)]
*  a lot of it, is if you think about the horrors of society, [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=429.78s)]
*  like violence, war, thievery, stealing resources, [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=434.34000000000003s)]
*  all that stuff, imprisoning people, corruption, [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=438.98s)]
*  all those things are like, those are built in [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=441.7s)]
*  primal behaviors in human beings, [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=444.7s)]
*  especially with unchecked power. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=447.14s)]
*  And I think that as long as we're just human beings, [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=449.02000000000004s)]
*  we're gonna have those things. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=452.7s)]
*  We'll have less and less of them. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=453.74s)]
*  We have way less now than we had during [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=455.22s)]
*  fucking King Henry VIII. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=457.22s)]
*  Like back during King Henry VIII, [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=459.22s)]
*  you couldn't have a podcast, he would fucking kill you. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=461.18s)]
*  When he wanted to get rid of his wives, [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=463.38s)]
*  he just chopped their fucking heads off. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=464.58s)]
*  Give me get a new one. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=466.58s)]
*  Get rid of her. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=467.73999999999995s)]
*  Off with her head. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=468.94s)]
*  You couldn't do that now. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=469.78s)]
*  Was it Henry VIII that was off with her head? [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=471.02s)]
*  Wasn't he the guy? [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=474.21999999999997s)]
*  He had like a few of them. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=475.94s)]
*  He would see it now, it would be, [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=476.97999999999996s)]
*  his wife would make a TikTok about it and a heartbeat, [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=478.7s)]
*  I feel like, or her sister would. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=480.97999999999996s)]
*  Oh yeah, she would be like, that motherfucker. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=482.62s)]
*  There was nothing wrong with her head. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=484.7s)]
*  He said her head was cursed. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=487.5s)]
*  Henry is lying. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=488.62s)]
*  Yeah, nowadays are different, man. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=491.7s)]
*  So that's like Steven Pinker's work, [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=493.46000000000004s)]
*  if you follow his work on violence and crime. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=495.74s)]
*  People always wanna think that violence and crime [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=498.02s)]
*  is more now than ever before, [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=500.90000000000003s)]
*  but the reality is, when you look at [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=502.7s)]
*  the course of human history, [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=505.06s)]
*  there's never been a more safe time [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=506.62s)]
*  to be alive than right now. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=509.26s)]
*  What do you think it looks like coming up? [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=511.02s)]
*  Do you think people start to, [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=512.42s)]
*  if fear, if people continue to be so full of fear, [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=514.26s)]
*  do people like resort back to like their tribal nature [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=518.8599999999999s)]
*  or what kind of starts to happen? [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=521.74s)]
*  They definitely do if the power goes out. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=523.06s)]
*  The only thing that keeps society together is power. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=525.62s)]
*  As soon as power goes out, you have no electricity, [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=528.02s)]
*  you have no cooling, so you can't stay in places [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=530.18s)]
*  where it's too hot and you can't live in places [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=532.42s)]
*  where it's too cold. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=533.9799999999999s)]
*  You're in a bad spot there. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=535.2199999999999s)]
*  So then if you're living in a place where it's too cold, [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=536.9399999999999s)]
*  you're heavily dependent upon firewood. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=539.2199999999999s)]
*  So a big part of your day is getting firewood. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=541.3399999999999s)]
*  You have to make sure you have enough, [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=544.42s)]
*  if you're living in Siberia, [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=545.6999999999999s)]
*  you have to have a fucking shit pile of firewood [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=547.1s)]
*  and you never let that fire go out, ever. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=550.26s)]
*  I'd get a bunch. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=551.74s)]
*  Ever, you need to have a bunch. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=552.98s)]
*  I would, I'd get there early and get it. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=554.5400000000001s)]
*  You gotta keep that fucking fire going, man, [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=555.94s)]
*  because if you're stuck out there [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=558.1800000000001s)]
*  and it's 70 degrees below zero, like you'll die. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=559.5s)]
*  Dude, imagine you fall asleep and it fucking goes out [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=563.1s)]
*  and then you have to wake up the other people [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=565.7s)]
*  and tell them. And a lot of these guys [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=567.74s)]
*  aren't using matches to start fires either, [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=568.66s)]
*  because that's one of the things that survival [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=571.0600000000001s)]
*  still tell you is like you're gonna run out of matches. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=572.98s)]
*  You should learn how to start a fire without matches. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=575.62s)]
*  So you gotta learn how to start a fire [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=578.18s)]
*  with steel and flint. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=579.42s)]
*  And you know. I don't know how. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=581.54s)]
*  It's fucking not easy, man. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=582.7s)]
*  There's some fire starters you can get like, [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=584.62s)]
*  chk, chk, chk, they're pretty good. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=586.22s)]
*  Have you seen people do it, [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=587.78s)]
*  like when you go hunting and stuff? [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=588.62s)]
*  You have? I've done it, yeah. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=589.66s)]
*  I've started fires with these little flint sticks. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=590.98s)]
*  So it's like a piece of steel and a piece of flint. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=593.74s)]
*  And there's these little things called fire starters. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=597.86s)]
*  And some people make them too. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=601.1800000000001s)]
*  One of the ways they make them is they take cotton balls, [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=602.9s)]
*  like cotton swabs, and they soak them in Vaseline. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=605.7s)]
*  And so then you take tinder. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=609.82s)]
*  So you have like, some people use steel wool. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=612.94s)]
*  Oh yeah. They use different things [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=615.98s)]
*  that you can like, you can make it with like shavings [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=617.98s)]
*  and dry the shavings out. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=621.86s)]
*  And then you slowly get little sparks onto those shavings [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=623.3000000000001s)]
*  and whoo, whoo, whoo, whoo, whoo. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=626.1800000000001s)]
*  And then once you get it going, [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=628.3000000000001s)]
*  then you put some little sticks on, [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=629.22s)]
*  then you put some bigger sticks on, now you have a fire. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=630.54s)]
*  And they say that you should know how to do that [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=633.58s)]
*  because you don't want to be on that last match going, [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=635.54s)]
*  fuck, fuck. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=638.34s)]
*  Like you have to know how to actually start a fire. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=639.9s)]
*  The best way is with tools. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=642.42s)]
*  I tried to start a fire when I was in the Boy Scouts [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=644.02s)]
*  with the bow. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=645.78s)]
*  I don't know if you ever did that one [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=647.0600000000001s)]
*  with like, there's a stick and you wrap it. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=647.9s)]
*  Oh yeah, and you do it like that or whatever? [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=649.5s)]
*  Back and forth and back and forth. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=650.94s)]
*  The cotton eye gel or whatever? [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=651.78s)]
*  I got it to smoke. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=652.86s)]
*  I got blackness came out of it. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=653.86s)]
*  I never got a fire. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=655.42s)]
*  I never got it to the point [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=657.14s)]
*  where I could like light something on fire there. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=658.5s)]
*  But I was also dumb. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=661.54s)]
*  I didn't realize you got to like put little tiny pieces [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=663.06s)]
*  of wood down in there once it starts going [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=665.86s)]
*  and blow on it. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=667.78s)]
*  I didn't, I thought I was a fire was going to get going. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=668.7s)]
*  Just fucking go on. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=670.86s)]
*  I thought that thing was going to light fire eventually. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=672.02s)]
*  Yeah, it didn't. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=674.26s)]
*  What in Scotland do you see any good music? [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=676.42s)]
*  ACDC is from Scotland. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=679.58s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=681.02s)]

*  For those who are about to rock. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=685.22s)]

*  Well, they keep changing it. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=695.94s)]
*  They keep changing it. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=700.94s)]
*  It's like Berenstein Bears, you know? [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=702.14s)]
*  It's like the Mandela effect. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=704.46s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=706.02s)]

*  No, I did see that they're supposed to, [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=782.38s)]
*  that Dana White was doing something with Mark Zuckerberg. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=784.02s)]
*  And that they were- [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=789.46s)]
*  He's part of his board now. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=790.3000000000001s)]

*  That's what they said. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=793.34s)]
*  They're gonna allow more free speech [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=794.1800000000001s)]
*  and allow people to not be restricted [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=795.48s)]
*  to talk about things were hot button issues before. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=797.58s)]
*  It's great. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=800.94s)]
*  And they're gonna remove the content moderation [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=801.78s)]
*  for a type of community notes. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=805.58s)]
*  Facebook and Instagram get rid of fact checkers. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=808.38s)]
*  The problem with fact checkers is, [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=811.22s)]
*  there's been a lot of fact checkers that were just wrong. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=813.26s)]
*  And it's very ideologically based. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=816.1800000000001s)]
*  Especially anything that has to do with climate change [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=819.74s)]
*  or anything that has to do with vaccines [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=822.82s)]
*  or anything that has to do with anything pharmacologically. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=824.9200000000001s)]
*  Yeah, it says in a video posted alongside a blog post [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=829.0s)]
*  by the company on Tuesday, [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=831.1800000000001s)]
*  Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg said [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=832.4200000000001s)]
*  third party moderators were too politically biased [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=834.1s)]
*  and it was time to get back to our roots [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=836.86s)]
*  around free expression. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=838.36s)]
*  But do you think they're really, [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=839.94s)]
*  I wonder if there's something else going on [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=841.0600000000001s)]
*  because I find it hard to believe they're really willing [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=842.66s)]
*  to give up that bias. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=844.74s)]
*  Like I started- [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=847.62s)]
*  Well, it's probably not good for business to keep that bias. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=848.46s)]
*  They're in a business. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=850.5400000000001s)]
*  Their business is social media. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=852.62s)]
*  And if Twitter sets a standard, which it clearly does. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=854.58s)]
*  So Twitter is the most wild of all big platforms. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=857.86s)]
*  You can get away with a lot of shit on Twitter. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=861.1s)]
*  That has not been the case with Facebook or Instagram. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=864.38s)]
*  And if Twitter continues to have the kind of engagement [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=868.06s)]
*  that it has because it lets people go wild. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=871.26s)]
*  And I know there's a lot of criticisms [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=873.26s)]
*  about even Twitter's content moderation, [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=874.5s)]
*  but everybody has to admit, [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=876.66s)]
*  it's certainly better than everywhere else. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=878.34s)]
*  It's like, there's a dispute now [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=881.06s)]
*  about whether or not people should be demonetized, right? [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=884.92s)]
*  Whether if you're allowed to speak on the platform, [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=888.82s)]
*  if they can say, you're saying things we don't like, [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=892.46s)]
*  we're gonna be able to take away your ability to make money. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=895.34s)]
*  Well, you're kind of censoring people in a way. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=898.14s)]
*  Because you're enforcing self-censorship. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=900.82s)]
*  Because they're not gonna say [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=903.3s)]
*  those inflammatory things anymore [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=904.14s)]
*  because then they need a Adrian Ditman account, right? [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=905.58s)]
*  Right. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=909.42s)]
*  And you want them accounts to talk some shit, [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=910.26s)]
*  blow a little steam off. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=911.9s)]
*  Well, I wonder- [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=913.66s)]
*  Talk a little shit about the government. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=914.5s)]
*  Is AI, what if AI, but how do we know that the information [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=915.5s)]
*  AI isn't being adjusted to fit whatever they wanted to say? [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=920.14s)]
*  That's one thing I always thought like- [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=924.14s)]
*  Well, it is. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=925.46s)]
*  It certainly is. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=926.66s)]
*  Like that was the problem with Google's Gemini [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=927.5s)]
*  when it first came out. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=929.26s)]
*  Google's Gemini, when it first came out, [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=930.66s)]
*  they said make images of Nazi soldiers. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=931.9399999999999s)]
*  They had multicultural Nazi soldiers. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=935.42s)]
*  Did you see that? [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=937.78s)]
*  Uh-uh. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=938.62s)]
*  Oh, you have to see it. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=939.4399999999999s)]
*  You have to see it, you're gonna freak out. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=940.5s)]
*  They had all types of Nazi soldiers? [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=941.8199999999999s)]
*  They had black Nazi soldiers. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=942.66s)]
*  They had a Native American Nazi. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=944.38s)]
*  Oh, at least everybody was doing it. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=945.98s)]
*  They had a Chinese Nazi. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=946.8199999999999s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=948.14s)]
*  At least I wanted to. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=948.98s)]
*  Bro, so dumb. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=950.8199999999999s)]
*  But it's like that's when you try to be woke [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=952.1s)]
*  and you attach it to everything. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=954.06s)]
*  Look, oh, well you're not representing reality. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=956.14s)]
*  I said show me Vikings, not Chinese midgets. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=958.5s)]
*  What are you doing? [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=961.62s)]
*  Like what are you doing? [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=962.46s)]
*  Why are you showing me this? [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=963.3s)]
*  Because it's woke is not reality. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=964.8199999999999s)]
*  And if you do that with AI, like look at this. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=967.38s)]
*  Look at those images. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=969.66s)]
*  Look at that, it looks like guys from fucking Nigeria [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=971.86s)]
*  in the lower left hand corner. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=974.5s)]
*  Look at the Native American lady with her braids. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=976.06s)]
*  That's so crazy, that's a Nazi soldier. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=978.38s)]
*  She's a cutie kinda. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=980.66s)]
*  She is kinda cute. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=981.9399999999999s)]
*  But look at that, that's nuts. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=983.6199999999999s)]
*  So if that's artificial intelligence, [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=985.5799999999999s)]
*  that's not intelligent at all. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=987.42s)]
*  Because you're ignoring the reality [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=988.8599999999999s)]
*  of what a Nazi looked like. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=990.54s)]
*  Right, but you'd only need a couple generations [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=991.5799999999999s)]
*  that it feels like to end up just brainwashing. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=993.4599999999999s)]
*  100%. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=996.9s)]
*  Like that's the thing that's super scary. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=997.7399999999999s)]
*  It's like instead of controlling what people write, [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=999.2199999999999s)]
*  you control what the paper will say. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=1001.9399999999999s)]
*  100%. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=1003.78s)]
*  It's almost like controlling. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=1004.62s)]
*  He who controls the AI controls the narrative [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=1006.62s)]
*  of the whole country. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=1009.1s)]
*  And it's gonna be smarter than you and me. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=1010.14s)]
*  Like you and me, if we have an opposition to something, [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=1011.9s)]
*  maybe we could say it in a funny way. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=1014.54s)]
*  Maybe we can relate to people [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=1016.82s)]
*  because they know the way we think. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=1019.1s)]
*  But AI is gonna be way better at communicating. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=1020.38s)]
*  So it's gonna be like we're gonna look stupid. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=1022.5s)]
*  Have you ever had a debate with someone [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=1024.98s)]
*  who's way smarter than you [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=1026.02s)]
*  and they're making more points than you and you're stuck? [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=1026.94s)]
*  Your episode of the Wild Ground. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=1029.34s)]
*  It's frustrating, right? [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=1030.66s)]
*  But you're trapped and you're like, [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=1033.74s)]
*  ah, fuck, I can't really articulate this as well. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=1035.38s)]
*  Most of my life is like that. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=1038.58s)]
*  Right, so imagine that, [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=1039.98s)]
*  but with the smartest people in the world [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=1041.5s)]
*  not being able to keep up. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=1043.14s)]
*  Because AI is going to literally be like, [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=1044.14s)]
*  not just the smartest person in the world, [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=1047.7s)]
*  but all of the smartest people in the world together. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=1049.82s)]
*  Wow, fuck. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=1053.66s)]
*  Yeah, I just worry then whoever controls that [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=1055.02s)]
*  is gonna control everything. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=1058.34s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=1059.38s)]
*  And these fucking eggheads that are running us [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=1060.22s)]
*  towards the edge of the cliff have to do what they're doing [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=1062.34s)]
*  because China's doing it [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=1064.9399999999998s)]
*  and they're stealing our data for sure. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=1066.06s)]
*  But let them have it. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=1068.9399999999998s)]
*  What are they getting? [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=1069.78s)]
*  They're replicating our research. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=1071.1s)]
*  They're making AI as well. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=1072.86s)]
*  They're way ahead in a lot of stuff, man. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=1074.62s)]
*  Way ahead. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=1076.3s)]
*  China's way ahead in drone technology. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=1077.1399999999999s)]
*  Way ahead. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=1078.6999999999998s)]
*  But what is, somebody could, [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=1080.1799999999998s)]
*  sometimes I guess with drone they can come in, [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=1082.3s)]
*  I guess eavesdrop, they can see what's going on. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=1084.1799999999998s)]
*  In these commercial drones. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=1086.22s)]
*  I don't know what the military has. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=1087.54s)]
*  And this was like a big subject of the Sean Ryan podcast [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=1088.98s)]
*  the other day. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=1092.3s)]
*  Do you know about this? [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=1093.1399999999999s)]
*  Yeah, they had a guy on there who came through [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=1093.98s)]
*  and said that, oh, that Liversburg guy? [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=1095.58s)]
*  The guy who supposedly blew himself up [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=1099.54s)]
*  in the Tesla cyber truck in front of Trump Tower. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=1103.78s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=1106.62s)]
*  Right. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=1107.46s)]
*  So there's a guy who came on the Sean Ryan podcast [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=1108.3s)]
*  and said that this dude, Matthew Liversburger, [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=1111.1399999999999s)]
*  is that what I said, [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=1115.1399999999999s)]
*  who apparently was on a television show 12 years ago [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=1115.98s)]
*  with Tim Kennedy. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=1119.78s)]
*  Oh yeah, I saw that. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=1120.78s)]
*  Green Beret TV show where they did Green Beret shit. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=1122.5s)]
*  Pretty cool. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=1124.3000000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=1125.14s)]
*  So this guy wrote this manifesto. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=1125.98s)]
*  He sent this, not, I wouldn't say a manifesto, [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=1128.46s)]
*  but a statement. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=1130.5400000000002s)]
*  And in that statement, there was no indication [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=1131.5800000000002s)]
*  he was gonna blow himself up in that statement, by the way. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=1133.7s)]
*  The statement was just talking about what he knew. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=1135.38s)]
*  And what was the problem was that these Chinese drones [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=1138.94s)]

*  and that we have this technology as well. [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=1146.38s)]
*  Was that the stuff that the guy who came on here [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=1148.5800000000002s)]
*  was talking about that time? [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=1150.3400000000001s)]
*  Here's what he says. [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=1151.3799999999999s)]
*  Here's what he says. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=1152.22s)]
*  What we've been seeing with drones [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=1153.06s)]
*  is the operational use of gravitic propulsion systems [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=1154.62s)]
*  powered by aircraft, [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=1157.26s)]
*  most recently China in the East Coast, [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=1158.22s)]
*  but throughout history, the US only. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=1160.86s)]
*  Only we in China have this capability. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=1163.98s)]
*  Our open location for this activity in the box is below. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=1166.62s)]
*  China has been launching them from the Atlantic, [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=1170.34s)]
*  from submarines for years, [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=1172.1399999999999s)]
*  but this activity recently has picked up. [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=1173.4199999999998s)]
*  As of now, it's just a show of force [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=1175.6999999999998s)]
*  and they're using it similar to how they use the balloon [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=1177.58s)]
*  for Cignit and ISR, [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=1180.22s)]
*  which are also part of the integrated comm system. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=1183.02s)]
*  There are dozens of these balloons in the air [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=1185.5800000000002s)]
*  at any given time. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=1188.02s)]
*  So what is, because of the speed and stealth [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=1190.3400000000001s)]
*  of these unmanned AC, [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=1193.18s)]
*  they are the most dangerous threat to national security [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=1195.14s)]
*  that has ever existed. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=1197.38s)]
*  They basically have an unlimited payload capacity [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=1198.54s)]
*  and can park it over the White House if they wanted. [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=1201.3400000000001s)]
*  It's checkmate. [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=1203.94s)]
*  Wow. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=1204.78s)]
*  US government needs to give the history of this, [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=1205.6200000000001s)]
*  how they're employing it and weaponizing it, [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=1207.22s)]
*  how China is employing them and what the way forward is. [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=1209.5s)]
*  China's poised to attack anywhere in the East Coast. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=1212.98s)]
*  Do you think that this is just, [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=1216.54s)]
*  this seems to me also like a fear tactic? [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=1219.26s)]
*  It could be. [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=1222.1s)]
*  It could be. [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=1222.94s)]
*  Because it feels big like that. [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=1224.18s)]
*  When someone releases a letter like that [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=1225.02s)]
*  and then blows themselves up [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=1227.86s)]
*  where they don't have a chance to talk about [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=1229.74s)]
*  and shot himself in the head with a fucking desert eagle. [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=1231.18s)]
*  You ever seen a desert eagle? [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=1233.94s)]
*  It's a giant overkill of a gun. [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=1235.58s)]
*  It's like a 50 caliber pistol. [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=1237.78s)]
*  What is it? [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=1239.86s)]
*  Is it a desert eagle 50 caliber? [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=1240.7s)]
*  Yes. [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=1243.5s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=1244.34s)]
*  I mean, they found the desert eagle. [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=1245.5s)]
*  I don't know if they officially said that. [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=1247.14s)]
*  But didn't they say that he shot himself in the head? [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=1249.5s)]
*  They said there was a gunshot wound [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=1251.18s)]
*  to the head of the victim in the car. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=1252.5s)]
*  And it's the worst too because. [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=1254.66s)]
*  Yeah, they didn't even claim it was him yet. [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=1255.74s)]
*  Right. [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=1257.58s)]
*  They haven't even. [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=1258.42s)]
*  No, because the DNA is so destroyed. [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=1259.26s)]
*  I mean, he's cooked. [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=1261.38s)]
*  So they have to sample DNA and then run it through a lab [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=1262.78s)]
*  and then figure out if it's him. [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=1266.26s)]
*  It's just. [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=1267.94s)]
*  They believe it's him though. [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=1268.8600000000001s)]
*  Right. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=1269.8600000000001s)]
*  It's so crazy how when something happens now, [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=1270.7s)]
*  it's like, we get the news so fast, right? [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=1272.46s)]
*  And we get video footage of it. [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=1275.98s)]
*  Like we get a lot of things fast that you don't, [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=1277.8200000000002s)]
*  you start getting so many ideas of what's happened [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=1280.1000000000001s)]
*  and so many like angles and lanes. [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=1282.8200000000002s)]
*  And you've had two podcasts come out from different people [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=1285.18s)]
*  before you even get anything from like the authorities. [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=1287.46s)]
*  Right? [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=1291.3400000000001s)]
*  But then you feel like you can't even trust [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=1292.18s)]
*  the authorities anyway. [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=1293.66s)]
*  It's so wild how we just are having to piece. [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=1294.58s)]
*  Everyone is kind of piecing together for themselves [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=1297.54s)]
*  what has happened every time. [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=1299.6999999999998s)]
*  That's crazy. [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=1300.86s)]
*  So that shows what it actually looks like [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=1301.6999999999998s)]
*  when a 50 caliber shoots a skull that's wrapped up [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=1304.26s)]
*  in that ballistic shell. [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=1307.82s)]
*  Show one more time. [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=1309.5s)]
*  Can we show this? [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=1310.6599999999999s)]
*  Yeah, watch this. [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=1311.5s)]
*  Boom. [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=1312.3799999999999s)]
*  It just gets destroyed. [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=1313.22s)]
*  That's it's an enormous round. [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=1314.62s)]
*  I mean, it's massive overkill to shoot yourself in the head [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=1317.3799999999999s)]
*  with one of those. [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=1319.62s)]
*  But the question is why would you use a cyber truck? [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=1320.46s)]
*  Because one of the things about a cyber truck [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=1325.98s)]
*  is if you're trying to do damage, [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=1327.46s)]
*  a cyber truck is way more robust than most trucks. [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=1329.06s)]
*  I mean, you can't even, they're bulletproof. [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=1331.74s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=1333.58s)]
*  I should try to shoot an arrow through one of them out here. [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=1334.42s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=1336.54s)]
*  Which is the worst thing ever to say about a vehicle. [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=1337.38s)]
*  I have a cyber truck. [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=1338.9s)]
*  And it's the, because then everybody's like, [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=1340.5s)]
*  oh, is it fucking bulletproof, bitch? [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=1342.66s)]
*  You know? [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=1345.06s)]
*  They want to shoot at your truck. [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=1345.9s)]
*  Everybody's like, yeah. Of course. [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=1346.82s)]
*  Look at this metal queer people would yell at me and shit. [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=1348.26s)]
*  Like, what is going on? [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=1351.06s)]
*  Like, just crazy. [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=1352.58s)]
*  I mean, but people want to challenge it. [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=1354.3s)]
*  Yeah, they don't like it. [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=1356.18s)]
*  There's a lot of people that either love those things. [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=1357.42s)]
*  I'm on that side or hate them. [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=1359.58s)]
*  That's my whole family. [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=1360.94s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=1361.94s)]
*  They're fucking, ew, they think it was gross. [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=1362.78s)]
*  I feel a little embarrassed when I get out of it sometimes [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=1365.5s)]
*  or I wouldn't have to get back in it. [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=1367.8600000000001s)]
*  It's a statement. [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=1368.98s)]
*  Uh, well, I got it like five years ago. [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=1369.82s)]
*  I wanted it so bad. [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=1371.7s)]
*  And you can put it on a hundred bucks [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=1372.6200000000001s)]
*  and say you had one kind of, you know? [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=1373.9s)]
*  I got one on order. [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=1375.94s)]
*  Yeah, I got one on order. [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=1376.8600000000001s)]
*  Everybody had one. [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=1378.78s)]
*  But the thing that, [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=1379.6200000000001s)]
*  you always feel like you're working for lows, [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=1380.46s)]
*  but you're never dropping off whatever you're supposed [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=1382.02s)]
*  to drop off too. [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=1383.74s)]
*  You feel like you're in a pickup truck? [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=1384.8600000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I feel like I'm always like, [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=1386.06s)]
*  you are in a pickup truck actually. [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=1387.78s)]
*  That's a good point. [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=1389.22s)]
*  I feel like I've always got a washer dryer, [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=1390.06s)]
*  but I've just don't know how to, [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=1392.02s)]
*  it has a feeling to it like I work for a Home Depot [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=1393.78s)]
*  and I'm delivering a Whirlpool. [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=1396.42s)]
*  Yeah, like something heavy. [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=1397.74s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=1399.02s)]
*  Well, it's so heavy. [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=1399.8600000000001s)]
*  How was that feeling? [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=1400.7s)]
*  That feeling of a refrigerator, it feels like. [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=1401.54s)]
*  Bro, if you get in an accident with that thing, [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=1403.22s)]

*  How did they have a charger? [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=1454.8600000000001s)]
*  This one place had a charger. [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=1456.14s)]
*  It was like an IGA. [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=1458.18s)]
*  How long did it take you to charge that whole cyber truck? [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=1459.06s)]
*  It took me two hours to just get enough to get out of there. [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=1461.18s)]

*  Where the charging? [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=1466.22s)]

*  That's it? [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=1469.9s)]
*  Yeah. It was, it was a tough, I mean, it took me half the day [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=1470.74s)]
*  to get back to my mom's in Baton Rouge. [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=1473.02s)]
*  See, that's the problem with long distance, [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=1475.66s)]
*  unless you go to a place that has like cities [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=1477.54s)]
*  where they have the super chargers. [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=1480.26s)]
*  Yeah. Well, I, then when I drove back to Nashville, [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=1481.46s)]
*  I hit like ones that had 300, 250 kilowatt hours. [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=1483.38s)]
*  One has 400 kilowatt hours. [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=1487.3s)]
*  It was a Mercedes dealership. [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=1489.06s)]
*  Wow. So how quick would that charge you up? [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=1490.38s)]
*  That thing will charge you up, I bet in about 45 minutes. [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=1492.42s)]
*  It's still. [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=1495.5800000000002s)]
*  All the way to 320 miles. [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=1496.42s)]
*  That's still a long fucking time. [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=1498.3799999999999s)]
*  Dude, I plugged it in at my buddy's house. [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=1499.3s)]
*  It gave me two miles an hour. [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=1501.3s)]
*  So in the morning, I woke up six hours later [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=1504.18s)]
*  and had 12 miles. [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=1505.82s)]
*  That's so crazy. [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=1507.26s)]
*  Yeah. So that was, but that was just like a lamp. [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=1508.1s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=1510.54s)]
*  Basically. [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=1511.3799999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=1512.22s)]
*  It was enough. [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=1513.06s)]
*  A lot of electricity. [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=1514.26s)]
*  Enough power to read by basically. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=1515.1s)]
*  Do you really save money though? [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=1516.3799999999999s)]
*  Have you ever looked at that? [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=1518.1399999999999s)]
*  Like, it's like, how much you's paying on gas [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=1519.3799999999999s)]
*  versus how much does it cost for electricity? [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=1521.82s)]
*  I don't think you really save any money. [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=1523.7s)]
*  And especially if you have to charge on one of those trips, [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=1525.1s)]
*  then it costs like, it's pretty expensive to charge up. [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=1527.8600000000001s)]
*  Like it's not more than gas, [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=1529.8600000000001s)]
*  but it's probably half the price, dude. [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=1531.66s)]
*  And then this was the worst thing. [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=1533.26s)]
*  So in Louisiana, they put a couple of chargers [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=1534.42s)]
*  back behind this church's chicken, right? [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=1537.38s)]
*  I like your like. [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=1539.26s)]
*  I gotta tell you about this shit. [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=1540.1000000000001s)]
*  You get some hand movements in here. [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=1542.74s)]
*  Well, look. [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=1544.74s)]
*  It's like, as soon as you start doing this, [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=1545.5800000000002s)]
*  like I know you got a point. [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=1547.9s)]
*  This was my holidays, dude. [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=1550.26s)]
*  It was tragic. [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=1551.7s)]
*  So I get off, I get, they got a church's chicken, right? [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=1553.0600000000002s)]
*  So to drive, the chargers are behind a church's chicken [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=1558.06s)]
*  for some reason, but there's no lane [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=1560.78s)]
*  to just drive back to the chargers. [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=1563.86s)]
*  You have to get in the to-go lane of the church's chickens. [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=1564.98s)]
*  You have to go in. [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=1567.78s)]
*  So there's a big line at the church's chicken, right? [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=1569.1399999999999s)]
*  So I get in line. [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=1571.1399999999999s)]
*  I have to wait in line to go to the lady at the order thing. [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=1572.1399999999999s)]
*  You know, it's like, take your order at the to-go order. [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=1574.6599999999999s)]
*  And I'm like, I'm just going to the charger. [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=1577.62s)]
*  So then I go back there and now I have to like meander [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=1579.4199999999998s)]
*  back and forth, like back and forth to get my car to park. [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=1583.34s)]
*  And it's hardly any room. [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=1586.26s)]
*  Now I'm just facing the people who were waiting in line [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=1587.5s)]
*  to pick up their chicken. [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=1589.46s)]
*  And there's two types of people in the world. [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=1591.3s)]
*  There's like people that wait in line at a church's chicken [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=1592.78s)]
*  in a drive-through to get food [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=1595.26s)]
*  and people who have a electric vehicle, right? [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=1596.7s)]
*  They're just, they're two different people. [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=1600.74s)]
*  Very. [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=1604.3799999999999s)]
*  Oh, so all these people are like, [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=1605.22s)]
*  and then I had to leave, right? [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=1606.86s)]
*  So I sit there in charge. [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=1608.5s)]
*  I had to leave. [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=1610.02s)]
*  Some lady is like, wouldn't let me back in line [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=1611.18s)]
*  because she didn't want me getting her chicken, right? [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=1614.7s)]
*  She's like, can't get my chicken. [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=1616.6200000000001s)]
*  And I'm like, I fucking, I don't want your chicken, right? [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=1618.5s)]
*  I'm just trying to get out of here. [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=1622.94s)]
*  But there was no way to go around the line. [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=1624.5s)]
*  Like you had to get in the line to leave. [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=1626.22s)]
*  Oh, that's the dumbest thing I've ever heard of. [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=1627.7s)]
*  So you had to order chicken [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=1629.46s)]
*  in order to use their electricity. [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=1630.8200000000002s)]
*  No, but I had to promise a lady [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=1631.98s)]
*  I was not going to get her chicken, dude. [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=1634.02s)]
*  I'll give you $11 not to ever fucking [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=1636.38s)]
*  even get any chicken from this place. [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=1639.1000000000001s)]
*  11? That's not enough. [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=1641.5400000000002s)]
*  Or 27 or whatever. [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=1642.8200000000002s)]
*  It just made me mad, dude. [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=1644.1399999999999s)]
*  But anyway, just that whole, but just- [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=1645.3799999999999s)]
*  How fast was that charger? [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=1646.74s)]
*  That charger was pretty quick. [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=1647.98s)]
*  It's 250 kilowatts an hour. [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=1648.98s)]
*  I'd say about an hour and 15 minutes you could charge her. [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=1650.1799999999998s)]
*  And you were ready to go an hour and 15 minutes? [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=1652.6999999999998s)]
*  I got out of there pretty, I got out of there early. [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=1654.6999999999998s)]
*  I cut out early. [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=1656.3799999999999s)]
*  But it was just a lot, man. [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=1657.62s)]
*  I love driving a Tesla around town [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=1658.82s)]

*  Mark Zuckerberg started doing jujitsu [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=2275.1200000000003s)]
*  and nothing turns you into a libertarian like jujitsu. [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=2276.86s)]
*  Really? [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=2279.98s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=2280.82s)]
*  Nothing turns you into a person who really values [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=2282.14s)]
*  hard work and discipline and struggle like jujitsu. [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=2285.54s)]
*  Because exposure of character on a level [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=2291.18s)]
*  that nothing else is like it. [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=2295.14s)]
*  Wow. [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=2297.24s)]
*  I hadn't thought about that that much. [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=2298.08s)]
*  Yeah, because you expose character in a way [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=2299.1s)]
*  that it's almost impossible, even with other martial arts. [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=2302.06s)]
*  Because with other martial arts, [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=2305.14s)]
*  you can only spar so much, man. [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=2306.14s)]
*  Believe me, because I spar too much. [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=2308.14s)]
*  You spar a lot, you get hurt. [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=2310.22s)]
*  And you get hurt, eventually you get dinged up [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=2312.3399999999997s)]
*  to the point where your brain [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=2314.7s)]
*  is just not firing so well anymore. [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=2316.14s)]
*  Like I was reading this horrible story, [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=2318.8399999999997s)]
*  where they're talking about Parkinson's, [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=2321.3799999999997s)]
*  and Muhammad Ali's daughter was talking about, [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=2322.98s)]
*  she remembers when she was young, [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=2326.2s)]
*  when he fought Leon Spinks the second time, [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=2328.06s)]
*  she could tell afterwards that he talked different. [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=2330.66s)]
*  You know? [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=2335.5s)]
*  It's gotta be tough for a kid, huh? [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=2337.18s)]
*  And you probably pretend that he doesn't, [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=2339.14s)]
*  because you don't wanna hurt his feelings or whatever. [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=2340.7799999999997s)]
*  Well, you must be so scared if you're a kid [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=2342.58s)]
*  and your father is a fighter. [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=2344.94s)]
*  That has to be so terrifying. [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=2346.42s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=2347.9s)]
*  Especially watching your father. [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=2348.74s)]
*  I've seen people that bring their kids to a fight, [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=2349.7799999999997s)]
*  and then they get flatlined. [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=2352.2599999999998s)]
*  And you see the terror in the kid's eyes, [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=2353.9s)]
*  where their father is fucking laid out, unconscious, [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=2357.5s)]
*  bleeding from his mouth, [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=2360.24s)]
*  and the doctor's holding his head up, [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=2361.3399999999997s)]
*  and his feet are twitching. [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=2362.7799999999997s)]
*  Yeah, and sometimes the kid doesn't even know [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=2365.5s)]
*  if the dad won or not, he's still cheering, [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=2367.06s)]
*  and you're like, this doesn't make any sense. [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=2368.66s)]
*  This kid is crazy. [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=2371.1s)]
*  Well, that kid might have other problems. [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=2372.3399999999997s)]
*  That kid might be already sparring already. [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=2373.62s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=2375.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=2376.02s)]
*  They might have that kid sparring young. [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=2376.8599999999997s)]
*  There's an argument for sparring young, [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=2379.16s)]
*  because you can't hurt each other. [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=2380.5s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=2382.06s)]
*  Sometimes I'll see reels on the internet [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=2382.8999999999996s)]
*  of on social media of kids that are young sparring. [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=2385.42s)]
*  It's really funny. [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=2387.7799999999997s)]
*  Sometimes they don't know what to do. [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=2388.62s)]
*  As long as they learn control, [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=2390.2999999999997s)]
*  they gotta learn control. [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=2391.62s)]
*  But if they learn control when they're young, [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=2392.8199999999997s)]
*  and they learn not to hit each other hard, [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=2395.18s)]
*  but just to do it fast, man, they can get so good, [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=2396.74s)]
*  because they don't hurt each other [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=2399.18s)]
*  the way adults hurt each other. [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=2400.62s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=2401.8199999999997s)]
*  Once you get to be 170 pounds, man, [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=2402.66s)]
*  you can generate a lot of force. [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=2404.54s)]
*  And so if you're sparring hard with another guy [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=2406.66s)]
*  that's 170 pounds, you're blasting each other [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=2408.62s)]
*  in the face and the legs and the body. [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=2410.7s)]
*  It's like, oh, God, you do so much damage. [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=2412.58s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=2415.02s)]
*  So much damage. [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=2415.8599999999997s)]
*  But little kids don't do that kind of damage. [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=2416.68s)]
*  They just slap each other a little. [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=2418.14s)]
*  Pat, pat, pat. [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=2419.14s)]
*  They just tap each other. [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=2419.9799999999996s)]
*  It's a good way to learn. [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=2421.2599999999998s)]
*  Oh, if I could go back and be a kid? [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=2422.5s)]
*  Is that what you'd do? [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=2424.7s)]
*  I mean, I would slay it. [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=2425.54s)]
*  Because if you could go back in time being a kid, [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=2426.62s)]
*  think of all the stuff you would do. [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=2428.62s)]
*  Well, let me tell you this. [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=2429.98s)]
*  If you were 90 years old right now, [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=2431.46s)]
*  oh, God, if I go back in time when I was 44 and limber. [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=2432.98s)]
*  It's true, huh? [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=2435.7799999999997s)]
*  That's what you would do. [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=2436.62s)]
*  Back in time, Theo Vaughn, for 2025. [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=2437.46s)]
*  Oh, my God. [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=2440.58s)]
*  I should have taken jujitsu back then. [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=2441.7s)]
*  I could have been a bad ass in 10 years. [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=2443.22s)]
*  If you take jujitsu right now, by 54, [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=2445.2599999999998s)]
*  you could be a black belt. [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=2447.2599999999998s)]
*  You think I could? [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=2448.22s)]
*  100%. [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=2449.06s)]
*  Yeah, you're an addict. [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=2450.1s)]
*  All you have to do is get addicted to jujitsu. [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=2451.22s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=2453.14s)]
*  That's what happens to a lot of addicts. [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=2453.98s)]
*  You can easily get addicted to running. [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=2455.06s)]
*  Come marathon runners. [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=2456.86s)]
*  Like my friend John Joseph, he became an Ironman guy. [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=2458.1s)]
*  Just started doing Ironman. [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=2461.2599999999998s)]
*  What about Goggins? [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=2462.42s)]
*  Did he ever suffer with addiction? [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=2463.5s)]
*  I don't know if he did or not. [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=2464.54s)]
*  Food, addiction, food. [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=2465.38s)]
*  Oh, yeah, that's right, huh? [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=2466.22s)]
*  Yeah, I think we all have that. [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=2467.06s)]
*  I get sugar sometimes. [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=2469.1s)]
*  Sugar's a good one. [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=2471.54s)]
*  God, I just want something. [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=2472.38s)]
*  Look at that Gatorade. [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=2473.66s)]
*  Is that a sugar-free Gatorade or a regular? [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=2474.5s)]
*  I told him it's sugar-free. [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=2476.22s)]
*  Zero. [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=2477.2599999999998s)]
*  I asked him to get sugar for you. [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=2478.1s)]
*  Zero's good. [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=2478.94s)]
*  You want a little bit of it? [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=2479.78s)]
*  No. [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=2480.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=2481.44s)]
*  Is that what I want to hit? [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=2482.28s)]
*  You want a taste in this whiskey? [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=2483.1s)]
*  I want a gram of this shit. [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=2484.02s)]
*  Dude, I would get so, [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=2485.2200000000003s)]
*  I've just been getting so dehydrated. [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=2486.78s)]
*  First of all, why is dehydration more of a thing now? [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=2488.18s)]
*  Dude, when I was growing up, nobody was like, [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=2490.82s)]
*  are you dehydrated? [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=2492.7000000000003s)]
*  We were talking about that the other podcast. [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=2493.54s)]
*  And we just, that's why it's important, [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=2494.38s)]
*  if you're gonna listen, you gotta listen to both podcasts. [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=2496.78s)]
*  Listen to that one first, [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=2499.38s)]
*  because we started talking about dehydration, [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=2500.66s)]
*  but then you got, [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=2502.3s)]
*  I think you started talking about zebras or something. [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=2503.26s)]
*  I did? [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=2504.86s)]
*  Yeah, you went off in a different direction. [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=2505.7000000000003s)]
*  Nah, you went off in a different direction, dude. [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=2506.52s)]
*  You started talking about bombs and aliens. [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=2509.06s)]
*  You haven't met you, dude. [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=2512.74s)]
*  I gotta introduce you to you. [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=2515.3799999999997s)]
*  You're gonna be intrigued. [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=2518.7799999999997s)]
*  I'd be fascinated. [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=2521.2999999999997s)]
*  But no, I think, what was I saying? [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=2523.1s)]
*  Hydration is important, though. [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=2525.66s)]
*  That's why electrolytes are important. [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=2526.9399999999996s)]
*  Why is it a big thing now? [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=2528.9799999999996s)]
*  You remember saying years ago, [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=2530.06s)]
*  nobody was like, 10 years ago, [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=2531.1s)]
*  nobody was like, people were like, [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=2532.3799999999997s)]
*  yes, stay hydrated, but nobody was like, [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=2533.5s)]
*  there wasn't this big crazy thing about it. [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=2535.3399999999997s)]
*  Well, there was once they figured out Gatorade. [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=2537.2599999999998s)]
*  So do you know what the original Gatorade ingredients were? [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=2539.7799999999997s)]
*  It was like citrus juice, like lemon juice, [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=2543.8999999999996s)]
*  salt, sugar, and water, I believe. [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=2546.4599999999996s)]
*  Pull that up. [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=2550.02s)]
*  So this was a criticism that someone was bringing up [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=2551.58s)]
*  on one of them Instagram reels, [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=2553.74s)]
*  and they were talking about the original Gatorade [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=2555.3399999999997s)]
*  versus the Gatorade that they have now [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=2557.58s)]
*  with all these crazy dyes and the color blue [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=2559.1s)]
*  and all this fucking, all the weird shit. [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=2561.8599999999997s)]
*  Like, Gatorade didn't used to be like that. [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=2563.8599999999997s)]
*  Gatorade was just like a hydration drink [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=2565.8999999999996s)]
*  that was pretty fucking good, pretty fucking good. [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=2568.2599999999998s)]
*  Like, hydration drinks are legit. [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=2571.3399999999997s)]
*  Electrolytes, that's a legit thing. [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=2573.06s)]
*  You really do need, you need sodium, [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=2575.22s)]
*  you need magnesium, you need, you need electrolytes. [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=2578.1s)]
*  Trace minerals. [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=2580.2999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, all that stuff's fucking really good for you. [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=2581.14s)]
*  And when you sweat a lot, [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=2583.18s)]
*  it helps to replenish it in your body. [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=2584.22s)]
*  Do you think, do you believe in that hydrogen water stuff [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=2586.2999999999997s)]
*  where it's like you charge water? [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=2590.1s)]
*  Yeah, it's legit. [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=2591.3399999999997s)]
*  It is? [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=2592.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=2593.02s)]
*  You gotta drink it like right after you make it. [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=2593.8599999999997s)]
*  The original Gatorade invented in 1965 by UFs, [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=2596.42s)]
*  is that University of Florida? [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=2600.1400000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=2601.26s)]
*  Robert Cade consisted of glucose, sodium, potassium, [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=2602.1s)]
*  and water. [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=2605.42s)]
*  That's it. [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=2606.26s)]
*  So, sodium, potassium, water, and some sugar. [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=2607.1s)]
*  The same formula we use for oral rehydration in cholera. [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=2610.2200000000003s)]
*  It worked, but it tasted like tiger piss. [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=2614.2200000000003s)]
*  Then Pepsi bought Gatorade and Michael Jordan [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=2616.54s)]
*  sweetened it with high fructose corn syrup and voila! [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=2618.94s)]
*  Michael Jordan brought us into the high fructose [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=2622.78s)]
*  corn syrup maze. [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=2625.3s)]
*  It was it. [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=2627.0600000000004s)]
*  Yeah, I remember he was the best ever. [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=2628.0600000000004s)]
*  Who's done better with sneakers than that guy? [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=2629.7000000000003s)]
*  Nobody, Jordans it became his name. [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=2632.46s)]
*  But also it became a thing. [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=2634.34s)]
*  It's a part of a brand that's a huge brand [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=2635.6600000000003s)]
*  and it's bigger than the brand. [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=2639.2000000000003s)]
*  Jordans are bigger than Nikes. [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=2640.7000000000003s)]
*  Like if you have Nikes on, that's one thing. [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=2642.54s)]
*  If you have Jordans on, like oh, he's got Jordans on. [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=2643.98s)]
*  That's wild, huh? [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=2645.7000000000003s)]
*  Theo Vons weren't Jordans, look at that, yeah. [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=2646.54s)]
*  I've never been a big shoe guy, really. [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=2649.5800000000004s)]
*  I got these jelly roll shoes on, he gave me. [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=2651.46s)]
*  Oh, those are tight. [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=2653.9s)]
*  These are like Hey Dudes are called. [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=2655.74s)]
*  Oh yeah, I got a pair of those. [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=2656.58s)]
*  But they're men, they're really men's slippers. [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=2657.5s)]
*  Something about it, yeah. [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=2659.3s)]
*  Yeah, they're slippers, Jordans slippers. [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=2660.7s)]
*  It's like let me go on the- [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=2661.78s)]
*  What are you gonna do if you have to fight? [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=2662.62s)]
*  Not put these on and go out on the porch. [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=2664.22s)]
*  On the porch. [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=2665.78s)]
*  I can see Theo scrapping on the porch. [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=2667.1s)]
*  By the way, I've seen more fist fights online [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=2670.86s)]
*  over the last three years than I have in my entire life. [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=2673.82s)]
*  My entire life of actually seeing street fights, [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=2677.2599999999998s)]
*  my entire life of being out in comedy clubs [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=2680.06s)]
*  and nightclubs and bars and seeing street fights. [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=2682.78s)]
*  I've seen more in the last three years [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=2685.42s)]
*  than all that combined. [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=2688.2200000000003s)]
*  Do you feel like we get an unrealistic view of reality [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=2689.5s)]
*  because of all the stuff that we see online? [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=2693.42s)]
*  You do. [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=2694.98s)]
*  But if you don't go and see an actual bar fight, [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=2695.82s)]
*  you don't know reality. [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=2698.98s)]
*  Like I remember I was 21 years old, I was in Boston. [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=2700.82s)]
*  I went to this bar and I saw this dude [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=2705.46s)]
*  break a Heineken bottle on this dude's face. [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=2707.5800000000004s)]

*  The dude did it so quickly out of nowhere. [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=2712.82s)]
*  His first move was break a Heineken bottle [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=2714.9s)]
*  on this guy's face and just cut this guy's face wide open. [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=2716.86s)]
*  It was blood was pouring down his face. [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=2720.0600000000004s)]
*  I was like, that is crazy. [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=2722.1800000000003s)]
*  And I was as close to that guy as I am to Jamie. [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=2724.78s)]
*  It was right there at the bar. [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=2727.98s)]
*  I watched it all go down. [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=2729.38s)]
*  I was like, that's, and put in my head, [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=2730.46s)]
*  like don't ever talk shit to somebody at a bar. [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=2734.1000000000004s)]
*  Like deescalate always. [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=2736.42s)]
*  Too many weapons around. [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=2738.38s)]
*  Well, just there's people out there [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=2739.3s)]
*  that will just break a fucking bottle over your face. [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=2740.82s)]
*  Especially if you threaten them. [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=2743.6600000000003s)]
*  I don't know what that guy said. [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=2744.9s)]
*  I don't know what happened. [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=2745.82s)]

*  I saw, I heard loud arguing and then smash. [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=2749.06s)]

*  It just gushed down his face. [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=2759.38s)]
*  I mean, this guy got ruined for life. [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=2761.86s)]
*  He has a giant scar on his face [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=2763.7400000000002s)]
*  for the rest of his life for sure. [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=2765.54s)]

*  any memory of it. [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=2801.46s)]
*  I was watching this video that I just saw on Instagram [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=2802.94s)]
*  the other day of this guy who was a former Muay Thai fighter [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=2805.54s)]
*  in Mexico, and he got in a fight with these dudes [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=2809.18s)]
*  and just started KOing dudes left and right. [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=2812.5s)]
*  He KO's like four or five dudes, and one of them died. [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=2815.3s)]

*  absolutely happens in street fights. [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=2821.7799999999997s)]
*  You knock a person out, they fall down, [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=2823.34s)]
*  they bounce their head off the concrete, [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=2825.54s)]
*  and they fucking die, and it happens all the time. [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=2827.02s)]
*  It happens all the time. [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=2830.86s)]

*  So 25% of them died. [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=2837.58s)]
*  One out of four, he KO's all four of them. [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=2839.22s)]
*  One dude never wakes up, and now he's charged with murder. [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=2841.7s)]

*  We, in Thailand, rode the elephants, [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=3097.14s)]
*  and I was like, I don't think this is cool. [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=3099.7400000000002s)]

*  They're wandering through the jungle. [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=3114.14s)]
*  While you're there, you hear trees, branches snapping, [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=3116.1s)]
*  and you see elephants just making their way [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=3120.3s)]
*  through the jungle to this group. [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=3121.98s)]

*  You watch the elephant, and you say nice things to it. [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=3131.7s)]
*  You develop this little relationship with the elephant. [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=3134.58s)]
*  Then you ride the elephant through the jungle. [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=3136.86s)]
*  The elephant takes you, and then at the end of it, [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=3139.02s)]
*  you bathe the elephant. [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=3141.7400000000002s)]
*  You get the elephant in the water, and you wash them. [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=3143.18s)]

*  You give them free food, and you give them a little massage. [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=3149.2599999999998s)]
*  But I made a video about it, I think. [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=3151.3799999999997s)]
*  Yeah, I definitely did. [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=3153.62s)]
*  I was like, I don't recommend it. [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=3155.1s)]
*  I was like, it's cool, [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=3157.02s)]
*  because I was hanging out with this elephant in the video. [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=3157.98s)]
*  They're really sweet creatures. [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=3160.2599999999998s)]
*  They're so gentle, but they're so big. [[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=3161.5s)]
*  And they're deciding not to kill you. [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=3164.2999999999997s)]
*  And you're riding them, [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=3167.66s)]
*  which is like, why do you have to ride them? [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=3168.66s)]
*  Why do we have that fatuation with people [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=3170.62s)]
*  that want to take pictures of like, [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=3174.7799999999997s)]

*  Well, the tigers are all drugged up, too. [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=3189.58s)]
*  That was another thing we did in Thailand. [[00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=3191.2999999999997s)]
*  You gotta be careful, dude. [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=3192.74s)]

*  I'll send this to you, Jamie, because you see it [[01:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=3939.14s)]
*  and you're like, what the fuck? [[01:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=3941.12s)]
*  These are real people. [[01:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=3942.56s)]
*  Where this guy is explaining how they do this. [[01:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=3943.94s)]
*  And he's explaining how they take people [[01:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=3947.64s)]
*  and push them over the edge. [[01:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=3950.28s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[01:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=3952.56s)]
*  People that are maybe a little bit lost [[01:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=3953.44s)]
*  and they give them a nudge to get them to do things. [[01:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=3956.88s)]
*  Well, it all makes sense. [[01:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=3961.64s)]
*  I mean, just like religion can find you or just like- [[01:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=3962.48s)]
*  Sure, the government can find you when you're vulnerable. [[01:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=3964.92s)]
*  Yeah, something can find you when you're vulnerable. [[01:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=3966.84s)]
*  Well, that's the kid that shot Trump. [[01:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=3968.84s)]
*  That's what a lot of people think that is too. [[01:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=3971.28s)]
*  The tin foil hat conspiracy [[01:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=3972.84s)]
*  is that they found this very vulnerable kid. [[01:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=3975.0s)]
*  He did a Black Rock commercial. [[01:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=3977.12s)]
*  And then a year and a half later, whatever it was, [[01:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=3978.6800000000003s)]
*  he's shooting at Trump off of a roof. [[01:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=3981.7599999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=3983.68s)]
*  So listen to this. [[01:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=3984.6s)]
*  Oh, just set him up. [[01:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=3985.8799999999997s)]
*  So CIA agent explains how the government baits and tricks [[01:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=3987.24s)]
*  mentally unwell social media users into committing crimes [[01:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=3989.9599999999996s)]
*  they wouldn't normally commit. [[01:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=3992.9199999999996s)]
*  And so it says you set them up. [[01:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=3995.2s)]
*  You create the situation to where they have no choice [[01:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=3997.4199999999996s)]
*  but to act on their impulse. [[01:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=3999.7999999999997s)]
*  That means they act on that impulse. [[01:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4001.2s)]
*  Then we call that entrapment. [[01:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4002.72s)]
*  We call it a nudge. [[01:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4004.2799999999997s)]
*  A nudge. [[01:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4006.04s)]
*  A nudge. [[01:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4006.8799999999997s)]
*  Sometimes you just gotta get a quick little, [[01:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4008.3599999999997s)]
*  just to see what happens, right? [[01:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4010.52s)]
*  How does that happen? [[01:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4012.44s)]
*  You put a post out there [[01:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4013.4s)]
*  or you have someone fake profile say something [[01:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4015.24s)]
*  that triggers, that we know is gonna trigger that, right? [[01:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4019.08s)]
*  Like we already know your history. [[01:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4021.64s)]
*  If we're to that point, we already know everything about it. [[01:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4023.44s)]
*  So we're like, oh, this will piss them off. [[01:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4026.12s)]
*  Sometimes you like the views and just wait for it to follow. [[01:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4030.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4033.0s)]
*  Nothing like putting on a fake social media thing [[01:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4033.8399999999997s)]
*  to like really get people mad. [[01:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4035.08s)]
*  Mm-hmm. [[01:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4036.68s)]
*  Post fake news. [[01:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4037.7999999999997s)]
*  Sometimes it's me. [[01:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4038.92s)]
*  Fake. [[01:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4040.1600000000003s)]
*  That's crazy. [[01:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4042.32s)]
*  Post a little bit. [[01:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4043.1600000000003s)]
*  So this is a guy's name is Gavin O'Blennis [[01:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4044.28s)]
*  and says CIA contracting officer, former FBI, San Diego. [[01:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4047.2000000000003s)]
*  Like is that to protect or serve? [[01:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4051.28s)]
*  Like what is that for? [[01:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4053.6400000000003s)]
*  You imagine that government money is being spent [[01:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4054.6000000000004s)]
*  to manipulate vulnerable people into doing things [[01:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4058.5600000000004s)]
*  that they wouldn't ordinarily do? [[01:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4061.96s)]
*  That's crazy. [[01:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4063.6000000000004s)]
*  I could totally imagine that. [[01:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4064.48s)]
*  I mean, that's what's scary about- [[01:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4065.5600000000004s)]
*  Why is it always these chatty gay guys that get busted? [[01:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4066.4s)]
*  Well, this guy obviously, it seems like was trying [[01:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4068.96s)]
*  to flirt with whoever he's talking to me. [[01:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4071.32s)]
*  And I'm not saying the guy enjoys buddies or whatever. [[01:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4073.48s)]
*  I'm just saying it seemed like that to me. [[01:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4076.96s)]
*  Yeah, chatty gay guys. [[01:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4079.4s)]
*  That's how they keep busting them. [[01:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4080.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4082.2400000000002s)]
*  They get hot guys on Grindr [[01:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4083.08s)]
*  to go meet up with chatty gay guys. [[01:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4084.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4087.4s)]
*  I wonder how they set that up. [[01:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4088.2400000000002s)]
*  I wonder if you have to have a bunch of verified fucks [[01:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4089.08s)]
*  in order for people to take it. [[01:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4091.36s)]
*  Like where's your blue check mark? [[01:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4092.4s)]
*  You gotta be really gay, buddy. [[01:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4093.92s)]
*  You gotta get a pink check mark. [[01:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4095.48s)]
*  Someone's fucked you. [[01:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4096.76s)]
*  All right, this guy's legit. [[01:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4097.6s)]
*  And you think there's a lot of people being fake gays [[01:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4099.64s)]
*  or whatever to help the government? [[01:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4102.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4105.4400000000005s)]
*  All that James O'Keefe stuff, [[01:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4106.280000000001s)]
*  back when he was at Project Veritas, [[01:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4108.360000000001s)]
*  they'd always bust these gay guys. [[01:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4109.88s)]
*  James O'Keefe, the author? [[01:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4111.52s)]
*  No. [[01:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4112.4800000000005s)]
*  No, the investigative journalist. [[01:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4113.320000000001s)]
*  Oh, I didn't see that. [[01:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4115.160000000001s)]
*  Very controversial investigative journalist [[01:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4116.0s)]
*  that does these undercover ops where he finds, [[01:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4117.84s)]
*  he gets one of his guys to wear a camera. [[01:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4121.84s)]
*  I'm thinking Robert O'Keefe, I think. [[01:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4124.200000000001s)]
*  I don't know who you're thinking of. [[01:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4125.92s)]
*  But James O'Keefe was with Project Veritas, [[01:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4127.28s)]
*  now he's got his own thing. [[01:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4130.16s)]
*  What is it called? [[01:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4132.04s)]
*  The James O'Keefe's, [[01:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4133.48s)]
*  OMG something? [[01:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4135.92s)]
*  OMG, right? [[01:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4136.92s)]
*  O'Keefe Media Group. [[01:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4138.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4139.4s)]
*  And so, looking into this guy, he might, that might, [[01:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4140.24s)]
*  might be a bullshit artist. [[01:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4142.96s)]
*  He might have been lying just so he could get laid, you know. [[01:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4143.88s)]
*  That's what I felt like 100%. [[01:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4146.5199999999995s)]
*  This guy seems like, [[01:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4148.08s)]
*  Just what someone claimed to look into him [[01:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4149.28s)]
*  and said he didn't work there. [[01:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4150.599999999999s)]
*  He's VA employed, advanced medical support assistant. [[01:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4151.92s)]
*  Okay, it says this guy is my age. [[01:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4155.84s)]
*  He was checking in patients at the VA [[01:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4158.44s)]
*  when I started as an FBI agent, [[01:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4160.08s)]
*  and that was 10 years older than many in 2022. [[01:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4162.08s)]
*  He was a secretary at the FBI. [[01:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4165.28s)]
*  Be skeptical people, geez. [[01:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4167.88s)]
*  So he might be just, well, it seemed like he was, [[01:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4169.5599999999995s)]
*  but also he probably does know how they do it. [[01:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4172.88s)]
*  Maybe he's not even saying that he does it [[01:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4177.0s)]
*  because he has a low position, [[01:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4178.76s)]
*  but if he's explaining how the FBI does it, [[01:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4180.08s)]
*  and he does work for the FBI. [[01:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4182.96s)]
*  It makes sense. [[01:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4185.16s)]
*  Do you think we can trust our FBI anymore? [[01:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4186.0s)]
*  I think you can trust some of them, [[01:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4189.2s)]
*  but the FBI is like people, and people in positions of power. [[01:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4190.84s)]
*  They get corrupted. [[01:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4194.6s)]
*  Some do get corrupted. [[01:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4195.92s)]
*  Some are great patriots. [[01:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4197.16s)]
*  It's just like everything else, man. [[01:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4198.36s)]
*  And the CIA, the same thing? [[01:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4199.76s)]
*  I think with every fucking group of people [[01:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4201.32s)]
*  that are in power that don't have a lot of oversight, [[01:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4203.36s)]
*  or where the organization itself has been corrupted. [[01:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4205.4s)]
*  You know, there's a lot of people that think the FBI, [[01:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4209.16s)]
*  back in the day, not the same people a lot today, [[01:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4211.0s)]
*  but had something to do with [[01:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4213.68s)]
*  Martin Luther King's assassination. [[01:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4214.52s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[01:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4215.92s)]
*  You know, there's a lot of people that think [[01:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4216.76s)]
*  they had something to do with Malcolm X's assassination. [[01:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4217.88s)]
*  Kennedy. [[01:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4220.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4221.68s)]
*  There's a lot of fucking theories, [[01:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4222.52s)]
*  and I don't know the truth. [[01:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4224.400000000001s)]
*  I don't know the truth. [[01:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4226.52s)]
*  But when you look in the January 6th thing, [[01:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4227.64s)]
*  and you said, didn't they admit they had 26 agents there? [[01:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4229.28s)]
*  Is that what they admitted to, Jamie? [[01:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4232.8s)]
*  Because it's the most recent discussion [[01:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4236.8s)]
*  about what actually took place in January 6th. [[01:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4238.4400000000005s)]
*  Like, how many of those people? [[01:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4240.68s)]
*  This article is talking about, this is 20? [[01:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4241.6s)]
*  20. [[01:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4244.200000000001s)]
*  I just wonder what starts to happen, [[01:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4245.76s)]
*  if you don't, if as a society you don't believe and trust, [[01:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4248.080000000001s)]
*  I believe that the trust overall in government, [[01:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4251.320000000001s)]
*  and government authority in America really as a whole, [[01:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4255.8s)]
*  is kind of starting to dissipate. [[01:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4260.52s)]
*  Along with the trust in the media. [[01:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4263.280000000001s)]
*  Right. [[01:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4264.76s)]
*  At the same time, both things. [[01:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4265.6s)]
*  So then what, has that ever happened in history, [[01:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4266.4400000000005s)]
*  and then I'm sure it has, and where do we go from here? [[01:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4268.88s)]
*  Well, we never lived in a time. [[01:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4272.4400000000005s)]
*  I guess that's too big of a question. [[01:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4274.28s)]
*  When you say, has it ever happened in history, [[01:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4275.12s)]
*  sure, things have fallen apart before, [[01:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4277.24s)]
*  but has it ever come back together again? [[01:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4279.12s)]
*  Maybe not, but maybe it didn't have the internet back then. [[01:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4281.52s)]
*  Right. [[01:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4284.400000000001s)]
*  So what people are looking at, [[01:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4285.24s)]
*  like with Trudeau resigning and Trump winning, [[01:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4286.24s)]
*  and then all this talk of Robert Kennedy getting in, [[01:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4288.68s)]
*  the Make America Healthy Again movement, [[01:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4292.12s)]
*  that we might be able to see legitimate change [[01:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4294.04s)]
*  this go-around. [[01:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4296.84s)]
*  Like with Vivek and Elon being in charge [[01:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4297.84s)]
*  of government efficiency, we might be able to see, [[01:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4300.2s)]
*  I'm hopeful, I'm really hopeful, [[01:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4303.16s)]
*  for the first time in a long time, [[01:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4304.56s)]
*  but I'm curious to see what can actually get done. [[01:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4306.24s)]
*  Who do they have to answer to, Vivek and Elon? [[01:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4308.56s)]
*  Who do they have to first present stuff to? [[01:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4310.64s)]
*  Somebody said it was Marjorie Taylor Greene, [[01:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4313.0s)]
*  is that true, or is that somebody who made that up? [[01:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4314.72s)]
*  There it is, they're in. [[01:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4316.16s)]
*  I met her at a party, actually. [[01:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4317.0s)]
*  Yeah, did you? [[01:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4321.28s)]
*  I didn't know that it was her, [[01:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4322.12s)]
*  I don't know a ton about politics, [[01:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4323.0s)]
*  but it was definitely interesting, though. [[01:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4324.4400000000005s)]
*  I'm fucking sure. [[01:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4326.92s)]
*  Tucker had that party for Alp, he has a new. [[01:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4328.08s)]
*  Yeah, it's nicotine pouches, they're good. [[01:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4330.6s)]
*  I haven't done them. [[01:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4333.4400000000005s)]
*  They're legit. [[01:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4334.52s)]
*  But yeah, it seemed cool. [[01:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4335.4400000000005s)]
*  Mel Gibson was there, that was pretty cool. [[01:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4337.4400000000005s)]
*  So I went without nicotine pouches for five days, [[01:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4338.68s)]
*  see what that was like. [[01:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4341.52s)]
*  What happened? [[01:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4342.360000000001s)]
*  When I tried the eights, when I came back, [[01:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4343.6s)]
*  I got these Lucy's, these breakers, the eights, [[01:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4345.360000000001s)]
*  I couldn't take it, it was too much. [[01:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4348.64s)]
*  Because five days off, I was like, whoa, this is too much. [[01:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4350.52s)]
*  And what happened, you get to sit down somewhere, [[01:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4352.84s)]
*  did you just? [[01:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4354.24s)]
*  I got to take it out of my mouth. [[01:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4355.08s)]
*  Then I switched to these threes. [[01:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4357.04s)]
*  I'm on this athletic nicotine, these threes. [[01:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4358.5599999999995s)]
*  So I've been taking these while I do podcasts, [[01:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4361.879999999999s)]
*  but completely killed my desire to just pop them in [[01:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4363.759999999999s)]
*  throughout the day. [[01:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4366.679999999999s)]
*  Because I was used to the eights, [[01:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4367.759999999999s)]
*  so I was popping them eights all day long. [[01:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4368.96s)]
*  But then I realized when I wasn't taking them [[01:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4371.0s)]
*  for the five days, I'm like, ooh, I'm a lot more calm. [[01:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4372.719999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4374.879999999999s)]
*  I'm a lot less ramped up. [[01:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4375.719999999999s)]
*  I don't need to be ramped up while I'm on vacation. [[01:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4376.879999999999s)]
*  I don't have to do any podcasts. [[01:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4378.839999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I don't need to be alive as much. [[01:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4380.28s)]
*  Well, I just mean, enjoy, just be chill. [[01:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4382.759999999999s)]
*  Why be alert? [[01:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4387.24s)]
*  Why be so alert? [[01:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4388.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4388.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4389.759999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4390.599999999999s)]
*  The thing is, you get used to being so alert. [[01:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4391.44s)]
*  And then you want them all the time. [[01:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4393.679999999999s)]
*  Want them before I lift. [[01:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4394.719999999999s)]
*  Fucking give me an eight before I lift. [[01:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4395.5599999999995s)]
*  Oh, I want something all the fucking time, dude. [[01:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4396.719999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4398.639999999999s)]
*  I want a fucking. [[01:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4399.48s)]
*  Want another sniff? [[01:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4400.32s)]
*  I wish I had that tracheal. [[01:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4401.16s)]
*  I'd just fucking. [[01:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4402.0s)]
*  Want another sniff? [[01:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4402.82s)]
*  Boof shit right into my neck all day. [[01:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4403.66s)]
*  Yeah, I'll take whatever you got, boy. [[01:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4404.719999999999s)]
*  Here we fucking go. [[01:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4406.44s)]
*  I heard a buddy the other day saying he's sober. [[01:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4408.0s)]
*  Oh, you're in, dude. [[01:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4410.599999999999s)]
*  Oh. [[01:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4412.16s)]
*  Oh. [[01:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4414.759999999999s)]
*  You look like a Jets fan. [[01:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4415.72s)]
*  I'm like looking at fireworks right now. [[01:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4417.04s)]
*  My eyes are closed. [[01:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4419.4800000000005s)]
*  It's just fireworks. [[01:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4420.56s)]
*  Oh yeah, give me some of that. [[01:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4422.08s)]
*  I'm dying off. [[01:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4422.92s)]
*  Ooh, fireworks. [[01:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4423.76s)]
*  Katy Perry dust, buddy. [[01:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4424.6s)]
*  Oh, enjoy. [[01:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4426.68s)]
*  You wanna see me ride it, don't you, love? [[01:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4427.88s)]
*  Imagine if Katy Perry takes her panties off. [[01:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4429.72s)]
*  Mm. [[01:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4431.52s)]
*  And that's it. [[01:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4433.0s)]
*  Oh no. [[01:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4433.88s)]
*  And I shouldn't have said the first part either [[01:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4435.200000000001s)]
*  because he's married. [[01:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4436.64s)]
*  But he said Katy Perry does this. [[01:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4437.4800000000005s)]
*  Yes, be respectful. [[01:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4438.4800000000005s)]
*  I am. [[01:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4439.76s)]
*  Well, let's imagine not a real Katy Perry, [[01:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4440.6s)]
*  but a robot Katy Perry, because that's coming. [[01:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4442.4400000000005s)]
*  Yeah, and we met Catherine Perry, who grew up down there. [[01:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4444.64s)]
*  Different gal. [[01:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4446.76s)]
*  She's from Toledo. [[01:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4447.6s)]
*  She's the girl that got body slammed. [[01:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4448.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4450.12s)]
*  Take a snap. [[01:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4452.360000000001s)]
*  Oh, you went deep, son. [[01:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4453.56s)]
*  You went so deep. [[01:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4456.240000000001s)]
*  You got that into your hairs. [[01:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4457.360000000001s)]
*  Here, give me that back before you hurt yourself. [[01:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4459.08s)]
*  Come on in. [[01:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4460.4800000000005s)]
*  You were reluctant to give it back. [[01:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4462.04s)]
*  You were thinking about going in. [[01:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4463.240000000001s)]
*  I'll fucking go again, boy. [[01:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4464.280000000001s)]
*  Huh? [[01:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4466.88s)]

*  Like whoever did it is a goddamn genius. [[01:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4597.2s)]
*  Because I was offended by the fact [[01:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4599.12s)]
*  that the chip was so dry. [[01:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4601.28s)]

*  and it wouldn't be as offensive. [[01:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4606.36s)]

*  Those were good. [[01:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4646.24s)]
*  You can't outlaw that stuff. [[01:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4647.08s)]
*  Just because some people have no self control. [[01:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4648.0s)]

*  I think three times. [[01:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4679.32s)]
*  But I said hi to him. [[01:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4680.799999999999s)]
*  Like, you know, like that. [[01:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4682.679999999999s)]
*  Was he like famous when you saw him? [[01:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4684.84s)]
*  He was famous for comedians. [[01:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4686.5199999999995s)]
*  He was famous. [[01:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4688.4s)]
*  He had been on Rodney Dangerfield's [[01:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4689.24s)]
*  young comedian special. [[01:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4690.88s)]
*  And that was a big deal back then. [[01:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4692.24s)]
*  This was before he even had his big HBO special. [[01:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4693.639999999999s)]
*  He was just this weird guy who was connected to Kinnison. [[01:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4697.759999999999s)]
*  And then the first time I saw him live, [[01:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4702.719999999999s)]
*  I was like, holy shit. [[01:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4704.24s)]
*  He was doing things that are so different [[01:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4706.2s)]
*  than any of the other comedy that was popular back then. [[01:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4708.12s)]
*  It was all like, he had something to say about things. [[01:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4712.24s)]
*  It was like cultural, it was like cultural commentary [[01:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4716.2s)]
*  with jokes. [[01:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4720.96s)]
*  But the cultural commentary was as much a part [[01:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4722.4s)]
*  as what he was saying was the fact that it was funny. [[01:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4724.44s)]
*  That was totally unique. [[01:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4726.44s)]
*  And then it became a thing where everybody was copying him. [[01:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4728.28s)]
*  Oh really? [[01:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4731.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4731.96s)]
*  So he was like one of those guys that people just started [[01:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4732.8s)]
*  being like, without even, [[01:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4734.04s)]
*  you think without even realizing it? [[01:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4734.88s)]
*  Yeah, without realizing it and realizing it [[01:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4736.36s)]
*  and just openly plagiarizing him. [[01:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4738.5599999999995s)]
*  He was very plagiarized by a bunch of people. [[01:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4740.2s)]
*  But he was just doing something different [[01:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4742.839999999999s)]
*  because his interests were different. [[01:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4745.2s)]
*  He was following his interests. [[01:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4746.639999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4748.24s)]
*  That's what he was interested in talking about. [[01:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4749.32s)]
*  And he was touring so much that he was working so much [[01:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4751.36s)]
*  that he had so much material [[01:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4755.0s)]
*  because he was just constantly playing in all these places. [[01:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4756.36s)]
*  And unlike a lot of really respected comedians, [[01:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4760.04s)]
*  he didn't do his tours in the big cities. [[01:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4763.5199999999995s)]
*  He was like touring around the deep South. [[01:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4765.8s)]
*  He called it his flying saucer tour [[01:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4768.360000000001s)]
*  because everywhere he would tour [[01:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4770.360000000001s)]
*  was where flying saucers would be spotted [[01:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4772.08s)]
*  like these weird fucked up cities. [[01:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4774.68s)]
*  And so he developed this like really intelligent act [[01:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4776.84s)]
*  that would work on dumb crowds. [[01:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4779.400000000001s)]
*  Very unique guy. [[01:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4781.6s)]
*  Like low brow, high art kind of stuff or something. [[01:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4783.400000000001s)]
*  Well, some of it was low brow. [[01:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4785.92s)]
*  Some of it was high brow. [[01:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4787.280000000001s)]
*  Some of it was just funny. [[01:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4788.400000000001s)]
*  Great social commentary on the war. [[01:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4790.0s)]
*  He was just great. [[01:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4792.6s)]
*  It was just a different thing. [[01:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4793.6s)]
*  He wasn't as like laugh out loud funny as like Richard Jeni. [[01:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4795.04s)]
*  But I remember me and Richard Jeni watched him once [[01:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4798.56s)]
*  and he said, God, every time I see that guy, [[01:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4800.52s)]
*  I'm like, I gotta do more of that. [[01:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4801.96s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[01:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4803.76s)]
*  Richard Jeni said that. [[01:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4804.68s)]
*  I saw him say it. [[01:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4805.72s)]
*  And so I'm like, wow. [[01:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4807.12s)]
*  Richard Jeni to me at that time [[01:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4808.12s)]
*  was one of the greatest comics alive. [[01:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4810.24s)]
*  He was so good in the 1980s. [[01:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4812.4400000000005s)]
*  Like people don't realize. [[01:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4814.72s)]
*  I've told this story before, just for you. [[01:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4816.0s)]
*  There's one time he was at the East Side Comedy Club. [[01:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4818.96s)]
*  And East Side Comedy Club was a big comedy club [[01:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4821.24s)]
*  in Long Island. [[01:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4824.12s)]
*  Great club, awesome club. [[01:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4825.0s)]
*  Richie Menterveni used to own it. [[01:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4826.44s)]
*  And we were there on Sunday [[01:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4828.12s)]
*  and the dude who was the MC over the weekend was depressed. [[01:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4830.96s)]
*  He was like, Richard Jeni did four different hours. [[01:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4834.24s)]
*  And he goes, he didn't repeat a joke once [[01:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4837.68s)]
*  and every hour he killed. [[01:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4839.2s)]
*  He goes, he did four completely different hours [[01:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4841.32s)]
*  and no one could do that back then. [[01:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4843.2s)]
*  So for Richard Jeni to tell me [[01:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4845.08s)]
*  that he was watching Bill Hicks, [[01:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4846.92s)]
*  like I gotta do more of that. [[01:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4848.36s)]
*  Like that's how influential he was. [[01:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4849.92s)]
*  Did you see George Carlin perform then too? [[01:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4853.16s)]
*  Yeah, I saw George perform a bunch of times. [[01:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4855.5599999999995s)]
*  I saw George perform in a time [[01:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4857.72s)]
*  where he wasn't doing so good. [[01:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4859.16s)]
*  He was struggling with his drugs you think? [[01:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4860.72s)]
*  I don't know man. [[01:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4862.44s)]
*  I saw him bomb in New Hampshire. [[01:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4863.28s)]
*  I took my roommates to a casino. [[01:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4865.599999999999s)]
*  Saw him play in a casino in New Hampshire [[01:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4867.4s)]
*  and he fucking ate shit. [[01:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4869.32s)]
*  It was weird. [[01:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4871.28s)]
*  It was weird. [[01:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4872.44s)]
*  It's like it wasn't worked out. [[01:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4873.28s)]
*  It's like he would go on stage with notebooks. [[01:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4874.599999999999s)]
*  And he was just kind of like working out ideas. [[01:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4878.5599999999995s)]
*  He had a very different way of doing comedy. [[01:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4880.32s)]
*  Like his way of doing comedy was [[01:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4882.92s)]
*  he would write everything out [[01:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4884.24s)]
*  and then he would bring notebooks on stage [[01:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4886.12s)]
*  and perform it as he wrote it. [[01:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4888.44s)]
*  Like he didn't do it like, [[01:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4890.599999999999s)]
*  almost like doing a one man show. [[01:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4891.599999999999s)]
*  And then every year he would film it for HBO. [[01:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4893.759999999999s)]
*  Damn. [[01:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4895.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4896.759999999999s)]
*  It was a totally different style of doing comedy. [[01:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4897.599999999999s)]
*  And so he went through periods in time [[01:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4899.44s)]
*  where he was doing real well [[01:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4900.84s)]
*  and he was real funny. [[01:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4902.4s)]
*  And then he went through some dark times [[01:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4903.5599999999995s)]
*  where he was bombing a lot. [[01:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4905.0s)]
*  And that's unfortunately the first time I saw him. [[01:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4906.12s)]
*  Have you ever seen Roll Tide Willie? [[01:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4910.44s)]
*  That guy. [[01:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4914.0s)]
*  Who's that? [[01:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4916.12s)]
*  Do you know who that is? [[01:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4917.36s)]
*  I'll put you on him. [[01:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4918.2s)]
*  He's like, I guess he's kind of a comedian now. [[01:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4920.28s)]
*  He played football for Alabama and then he got injured. [[01:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4922.0s)]
*  He was in the military. [[01:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4926.2s)]
*  See if you can pull up something of him. [[01:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4930.639999999999s)]
*  What does he do? [[01:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4933.639999999999s)]
*  Does he just say his crazy things? [[01:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4934.48s)]
*  He loves Alabama. [[01:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4935.32s)]
*  He's like a... [[01:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4936.16s)]
*  Like a mascot? [[01:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4938.599999999999s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[01:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4940.04s)]
*  He's like a mascot. [[01:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4940.88s)]
*  He likes alcohol. [[01:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4941.72s)]
*  He looks like he likes alcohol. [[01:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4943.400000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4944.72s)]
*  Sitting here watching and waiting on the Bama Gang. [[01:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4945.56s)]
*  Look right here on this side. [[01:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4949.320000000001s)]
*  Chilling. [[01:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4950.88s)]
*  Chilling. [[01:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4951.72s)]
*  Don't give a piss. [[01:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4953.0s)]
*  Don't give a piss about nothing but the Tide. [[01:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4956.24s)]
*  What you doing with... [[01:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4960.52s)]
*  The Tide, Alabama Tide, he likes. [[01:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4961.360000000001s)]
*  Wow. [[01:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4963.2s)]
*  That's one of his favorites. [[01:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4964.04s)]
*  You gotta give people the freedom [[01:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4964.860000000001s)]
*  to not give a fuck about anything but the Tide. [[01:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4966.08s)]
*  Right? [[01:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4968.96s)]
*  That's one of the... [[01:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4969.8s)]
*  Right? [[01:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4970.64s)]
*  If you're gonna have transgenders going into the men's room [[01:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4971.4800000000005s)]
*  or the women's room, you're gonna have to have that guy too. [[01:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4973.56s)]
*  You gotta be tolerant of that guy. [[01:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4976.68s)]
*  Oh, 100%, man. [[01:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4980.320000000001s)]
*  How come you're not? [[01:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4981.320000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4982.16s)]
*  Why are you so judgmental? [[01:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4983.0s)]
*  Like that guy, have some tolerance. [[01:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4984.92s)]
*  Yeah, he served for our country too. [[01:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4986.52s)]
*  Did he? [[01:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4988.2s)]
*  Yeah, he got injured in the... [[01:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4989.04s)]
*  I think he got injured. [[01:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4990.6s)]
*  He was in the military with my friend's dad. [[01:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4993.16s)]
*  But he... [[01:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4995.52s)]
*  I think he played at University of Alabama, [[01:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4997.360000000001s)]
*  but now he's like the biggest fan. [[01:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=4999.4800000000005s)]
*  But he's kind of a mascot for Alabama. [[01:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5000.8s)]
*  He's like the... [[01:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5004.84s)]
*  They call it... [[01:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5005.68s)]
*  He goes by Roll Tide Willie. [[01:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5006.52s)]
*  Okay. [[01:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5008.64s)]

*  Why did you wanna bring him up? [[01:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5010.320000000001s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5012.8s)]
*  Just came to mind? [[01:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5013.72s)]
*  Yeah, I just think we're just talking about... [[01:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5014.8s)]
*  What were we talking about? [[01:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5015.92s)]
*  Oh, comedians, entertainers. [[01:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5016.76s)]
*  I think entertainment's getting interesting [[01:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5018.160000000001s)]
*  because a lot of people are getting entertainers too [[01:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5019.6s)]
*  just off of social media reels, right? [[01:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5021.320000000001s)]
*  Right. [[01:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5024.0s)]
*  So it's like you're finding somebody... [[01:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5024.84s)]
*  You might wanna watch like Jessica McGowan or something. [[01:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5025.68s)]
*  Who's that? [[01:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5032.04s)]
*  Shit, the lady from Buffy the Vampire Sire [[01:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5033.240000000001s)]
*  I'm talking about? [[01:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5035.400000000001s)]
*  Or, you know... [[01:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5036.240000000001s)]
*  Gwyneth Paltrow. [[01:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5039.12s)]
*  Or watch like a... [[01:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5040.56s)]
*  Or watch Roll Tide Willie. [[01:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5044.64s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[01:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5045.68s)]
*  It's just so... [[01:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5046.52s)]
*  It's... [[01:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5047.360000000001s)]
*  Entertainment's just super interesting now. [[01:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5048.200000000001s)]
*  Well, it's definitely open to more things, right? [[01:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5050.04s)]
*  Like Tim Dillon turned me on to that family in New Jersey [[01:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5052.360000000001s)]
*  that goes to Costco and yells out about cookies. [[01:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5054.88s)]
*  Oh, the booms. [[01:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5058.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5059.72s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[01:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5060.56s)]
*  That's unfortunate, right? [[01:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5061.38s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, it's crazy. [[01:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5062.22s)]
*  And the one kid... [[01:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5065.52s)]
*  We saw how many millions of people watch that. [[01:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5066.36s)]
*  That's way more than watch CNN. [[01:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5068.04s)]
*  We bring the boom, yeah, that kid. [[01:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5069.4400000000005s)]
*  And the one kid I heard didn't even make good grades, [[01:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5071.24s)]
*  unfortunately, which is like... [[01:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5073.16s)]
*  Well, he's not even in school. [[01:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5074.6s)]
*  Why should he? [[01:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5076.16s)]
*  He's gonna make that Costco TikTok money. [[01:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5077.08s)]
*  They better not ban TikTok. [[01:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5079.68s)]
*  Imagine that family becomes homeless [[01:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5081.04s)]
*  because some heartless politicians decide [[01:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5082.88s)]
*  to stop that Chinese spyware. [[01:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5084.68s)]
*  How about let those morons stay on that shit? [[01:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5086.76s)]
*  Let them steal their passwords. [[01:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5088.92s)]
*  Let them go boom. [[01:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5090.76s)]
*  I'm on there. [[01:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5092.4800000000005s)]
*  You should be. [[01:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5094.12s)]
*  But they're taking all... [[01:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5095.04s)]
*  They're taking... [[01:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5096.12s)]
*  But yeah, I guess I'm wondering sometimes [[01:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5097.2s)]
*  what are the Chinese actually taking [[01:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5098.64s)]
*  that they already have for me? [[01:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5100.0s)]
*  Except, I mean, they could geolocate me. [[01:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5101.24s)]
*  Your DNA. [[01:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5103.400000000001s)]
*  They're gonna clone you. [[01:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5104.24s)]
*  You're gonna be like Alex Jones. [[01:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5105.56s)]
*  They're gonna have a different version of you. [[01:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5106.68s)]
*  Half my family's in recovery. [[01:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5108.16s)]
*  You can have it, bud. [[01:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5109.42s)]
*  Okay. [[01:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5110.44s)]
*  You can fucking have it, dude. [[01:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5111.28s)]
*  Do you think any of those drones are Chinese? [[01:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5116.679999999999s)]
*  How could we have in our airspace [[01:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5119.839999999999s)]
*  a drone from another country and we don't know it? [[01:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5122.32s)]
*  That's why... [[01:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5124.679999999999s)]
*  All of them... [[01:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5125.639999999999s)]
*  Is it that we don't know it [[01:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5126.48s)]
*  or we can't do anything about it? [[01:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5127.32s)]
*  Oh, we could do something about it. [[01:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5130.0s)]
*  Well, you have to decide to do something about it. [[01:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5131.879999999999s)]
*  And the Biden administration doesn't seem [[01:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5134.16s)]
*  like they're the type that would just be [[01:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5136.28s)]
*  shooting shit out of the sky. [[01:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5137.799999999999s)]
*  That's your point. [[01:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5139.16s)]
*  Whereas Trump, that motherfucker [[01:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5140.16s)]
*  will shoot some shit out of the sky. [[01:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5143.44s)]
*  They didn't tell him about some of the balloons [[01:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5144.96s)]
*  that China had circling the country [[01:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5146.68s)]
*  because they were worried he was gonna have them [[01:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5148.32s)]
*  shot out of the sky. [[01:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5149.68s)]
*  No way. [[01:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5150.5199999999995s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[01:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5151.34s)]
*  They openly admitted that they didn't tell Trump [[01:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5152.18s)]
*  about some of the balloons. [[01:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5154.16s)]
*  Remember when they shot that balloon out of the sky? [[01:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5155.18s)]
*  When they shot that balloon out of the sky, [[01:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5157.32s)]
*  we were talking about this the other day, they missed. [[01:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5158.599999999999s)]
*  One of those missiles missed. [[01:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5161.76s)]
*  And went where? [[01:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5163.599999999999s)]
*  Who fucking knows? [[01:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5164.44s)]
*  It's like New Year's Eve in San Antonio, dude. [[01:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5167.8s)]
*  Imagine if you're hiking, you're out there [[01:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5170.92s)]
*  in the wilderness, like this is amazing. [[01:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5171.88s)]
*  I've got my jet boil, I'm gonna cook up some ramen tonight. [[01:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5173.5199999999995s)]
*  Yeah, eight times. [[01:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5177.56s)]
*  And boom, right in the face, right in the face, [[01:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5178.4s)]
*  a missile that was meant for a Chinese balloon. [[01:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5182.92s)]
*  And they're never gonna admit to that, they'll say it was. [[01:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5185.24s)]
*  You vanished. [[01:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5187.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5188.0s)]
*  There's nothing to even test. [[01:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5188.84s)]
*  You'll be on one of those 411 documentaries or something. [[01:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5189.66s)]
*  You get hit in the face with a missile, [[01:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5191.8s)]
*  there's nothing left. [[01:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5193.48s)]
*  That's on YouTube, dude. [[01:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5194.8s)]
*  There's nothing left. [[01:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5195.64s)]
*  They don't even know you were there. [[01:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5197.4s)]
*  You got ate by wolves, who knows what happened to you. [[01:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5199.84s)]
*  Baby girl is gone. [[01:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5202.6s)]
*  You're gone, there's nothing, you're pink mist. [[01:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5203.84s)]
*  They're gonna scrape you off the leaves, do a DNA test. [[01:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5207.04s)]
*  Yeah, dude. [[01:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5210.84s)]
*  You get hit with a missile out of a fucking fighter jet. [[01:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5212.24s)]
*  It wouldn't be enough, there'd be barely enough [[01:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5215.36s)]
*  for a wolf to lick a little bit of you off a rock. [[01:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5216.8s)]
*  Okay, let's imagine that Beirut bomb. [[01:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5219.0s)]
*  Okay. That Beirut bomb. [[01:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5221.5199999999995s)]
*  What do you do? [[01:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5222.72s)]
*  You see it fall and what do you do? [[01:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5223.5599999999995s)]
*  You don't do anything. [[01:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5224.5599999999995s)]
*  You gotta do something. [[01:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5225.96s)]
*  You don't do a thing. [[01:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5226.8s)]
*  You just go, oh no, and then you vaporize. [[01:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5228.12s)]
*  You prepare yourself for the next dimension. [[01:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5231.12s)]
*  How long do you get? [[01:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5232.8s)]
*  I say if it's two pieces. [[01:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5233.64s)]
*  You don't get any time at all. [[01:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5234.48s)]
*  Come on, man. It just happens so fast. [[01:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5235.96s)]
*  If you're in the epicenter of one of those bombs [[01:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5237.5199999999995s)]
*  and it just goes off, you don't have any time. [[01:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5240.0s)]
*  It's just, boom, vaporize. [[01:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5242.48s)]
*  The whole city's vaporized. [[01:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5244.4s)]
*  What if you're 2,000 yards off? [[01:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5245.68s)]
*  You might live, who knows? [[01:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5249.16s)]
*  You might be behind a fucking building [[01:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5250.5599999999995s)]
*  and the building might stay up [[01:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5252.8s)]
*  and you just get your eardrums blown out [[01:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5254.2s)]
*  and you get the kind of concussion [[01:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5256.6s)]
*  that you usually get from a horrible car accident. [[01:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5258.360000000001s)]
*  Who knows? [[01:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5261.4400000000005s)]
*  I would imagine there's a level [[01:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5262.72s)]
*  where you could be far enough away [[01:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5264.6s)]
*  where it's not death, like instant death, [[01:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5266.52s)]
*  but where's that level? [[01:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5269.0s)]
*  Where is it? [[01:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5270.280000000001s)]
*  It's not close. [[01:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5271.120000000001s)]
*  Close, you're dead for sure. [[01:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5271.9400000000005s)]
*  So how far out do you have to be [[01:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5273.0s)]

*  and now you can't see? [[01:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5277.8s)]
*  Who knows? [[01:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5279.240000000001s)]
*  Now you have no memory of your childhood. [[01:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5280.08s)]
*  It's like a concussion of epic proportions [[01:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5281.88s)]
*  even if you survive. [[01:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5284.400000000001s)]
*  Depending on how far out you are. [[01:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5286.04s)]
*  And then you get far out enough [[01:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5288.04s)]
*  that it doesn't affect you at all. [[01:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5289.84s)]
*  You can see it from a distance. [[01:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5291.04s)]
*  That's gotta be crazy too [[01:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5292.16s)]
*  to know that you could've just been over there [[01:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5293.2s)]

*  Do you hear about the dude that survived Hiroshima [[01:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5298.08s)]
*  and then he went to Nagasaki to work [[01:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5300.6s)]
*  and then he survived Nagasaki? [[01:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5302.2s)]
*  He survived both of them? [[01:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5305.2s)]
*  He just survived both of them. [[01:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5306.04s)]
*  Still alive? [[01:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5307.08s)]
*  Still alive. [[01:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5307.92s)]
*  I think he died recently. [[01:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5308.74s)]
*  But this dude, he went from, [[01:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5310.08s)]
*  yeah, I think he died a while ago [[01:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5312.24s)]
*  now that I'm thinking about it. [[01:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5313.84s)]
*  This dude went, he was in Hiroshima, [[01:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5314.96s)]
*  bomb blew up, killed how many people? [[01:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5317.64s)]
*  150,000 people instantaneously. [[01:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5320.92s)]

*  Nagasaki gets hit. [[01:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5327.2s)]
*  It was less than two miles from the blast zones of both. [[01:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5330.64s)]
*  Jeez. [[01:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5333.32s)]
*  And did he say how he survived each time? [[01:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5335.04s)]
*  What was the guy's name? [[01:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5336.56s)]
*  I can't pronounce the first name, I'll show you. [[01:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5338.52s)]
*  Give him some credit. [[01:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5340.4400000000005s)]
*  Give Theo a shot at it. [[01:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5341.28s)]
*  What's his name? [[01:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5344.24s)]
*  Sumitomo, Sumitomo Yamaguchi. [[01:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5346.48s)]
*  Yeah, Tatsumo Yamaguchi. [[01:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5351.5199999999995s)]
*  Tatsumo Yamaguchi was less than. [[01:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5354.2s)]
*  Been quite a few fires, named Yamaguchi. [[01:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5355.76s)]
*  Two fires. [[01:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5357.96s)]
*  Less than two miles from the blast zones [[01:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5358.8s)]
*  of Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombings [[01:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5360.8s)]
*  and miraculously survived both without debilitating injuries. [[01:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5362.8s)]
*  My double radiation exposure [[01:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5366.16s)]
*  is now an official government record, Yamaguchi said. [[01:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5367.5599999999995s)]
*  I can tell you the younger generation, [[01:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5370.24s)]
*  the horrifying history of the atomic bombings [[01:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5371.76s)]
*  even before I die. [[01:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5373.6s)]
*  Do you think we should have done that, Joe, that bomb? [[01:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5375.2s)]
*  Wow, he lived, he died of stomach cancer at 93. [[01:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5377.92s)]
*  Oh my God. [[01:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5381.280000000001s)]
*  That's incredible, he lived that long. [[01:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5382.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5384.0s)]
*  Stomach cancer, one of us because of the bomb. [[01:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5385.6s)]
*  I mean, he died at 93. [[01:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5388.320000000001s)]
*  But some Asians live very long. [[01:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5390.52s)]
*  You can get 120 years out of it. [[01:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5393.04s)]
*  Do I think we should have dropped the bomb on people? [[01:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5394.52s)]
*  No. [[01:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5396.64s)]
*  Yeah, me neither. [[01:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5397.4800000000005s)]
*  No, it's fucking insane. [[01:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5398.320000000001s)]
*  It's so insane. [[01:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5399.76s)]
*  But it just goes to show you that somewhere inside of us, [[01:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5400.96s)]
*  there's an evil that will be evil, you know? [[01:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5403.12s)]
*  Bro, look at this. [[01:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5405.56s)]
*  No, go up, go up, go up. [[01:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5407.4s)]
*  He opposed the country's role in World War II [[01:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5409.64s)]
*  and became so despondent about the war [[01:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5411.68s)]
*  that he considered killing his wife and infant son [[01:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5413.4400000000005s)]
*  with sleeping pills if Japan lost. [[01:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5416.12s)]
*  Holy fuck, dude. [[01:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5418.96s)]
*  Company man. [[01:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5420.2s)]
*  Jesus Christ, that's so scary. [[01:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5421.4400000000005s)]
*  It's heartbreaking. [[01:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5423.16s)]
*  So this guy was lit with a blaze, [[01:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5424.52s)]
*  the lightning of a huge magnesium flare. [[01:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5426.56s)]
*  He saw the plane coming. [[01:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5429.759999999999s)]
*  Oh my God. [[01:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5430.959999999999s)]
*  He saw the Enola Gay fly over Hiroshima [[01:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5432.48s)]
*  and drop an item carried by two parachutes. [[01:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5435.12s)]
*  Suddenly, he said the sky lit with a blaze. [[01:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5438.2s)]
*  Oh my God. [[01:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5440.919999999999s)]
*  Do you have a bomb shelter? [[01:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5441.759999999999s)]
*  Joe, do you have a bomb shelter at home? [[01:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5442.759999999999s)]
*  I should probably get one, [[01:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5444.799999999999s)]
*  but I really think that if a nuclear war breaks out, [[01:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5445.639999999999s)]
*  you really wanna be right where the nuke hits. [[01:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5448.48s)]
*  You wanna end, you don't wanna be in Maryland. [[01:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5451.599999999999s)]
*  You don't wanna live in a zombie apocalypse post-war. [[01:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5453.0s)]
*  What am I doing? [[01:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5457.5199999999995s)]
*  I think I fainted for a while. [[01:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5458.96s)]
*  Not above. [[01:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5460.2s)]
*  Oh, the ground roared in an ear-shattering noise [[01:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5461.04s)]
*  ripped through the air, [[01:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5464.0s)]
*  tossing Yamaguchi into the air [[01:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5464.84s)]
*  as a fireball imploded overhead. [[01:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5466.64s)]
*  He was dropped face first into a muddy furrow. [[01:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5469.08s)]
*  The protective measures he took likely saved his life. [[01:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5471.76s)]
*  A woman who had been walking beside him [[01:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5474.36s)]
*  shortly before the blast disappeared altogether. [[01:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5475.88s)]
*  I think I fainted for a while. [[01:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5480.08s)]
*  When I opened my eyes, everything was dark. [[01:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5481.44s)]
*  I couldn't see much. [[01:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5483.44s)]
*  It was like the start of a film at the cinema [[01:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5484.32s)]
*  before the picture has begun [[01:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5485.92s)]
*  when the blank frames are just flashing up [[01:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5487.32s)]
*  without any sound. [[01:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5489.92s)]
*  Unreal. [[01:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5491.08s)]
*  Fuck, dude. [[01:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5492.0s)]
*  Look at it look like. [[01:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5492.96s)]
*  Fuck. [[01:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5494.599999999999s)]
*  Can you even fathom, one second it looks one way, [[01:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5495.799999999999s)]
*  and the next second it looks another way. [[01:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5498.48s)]
*  And no one's ever done this before [[01:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5499.96s)]
*  that we know of on Earth. [[01:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5501.36s)]
*  And then they just decided to drop it on a city. [[01:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5504.12s)]
*  Jesus, and they did it again. [[01:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5508.16s)]
*  Boom, boom. [[01:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5509.96s)]
*  The scene in the Oppenheimer, [[01:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5511.639999999999s)]
*  when they're deciding where to do it, [[01:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5512.84s)]
*  if that's how it went down is crazy. [[01:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5514.12s)]
*  Nuts. [[01:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5515.799999999999s)]
*  I gotta watch that. [[01:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5516.76s)]
*  That movie's crazy. [[01:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5517.64s)]
*  Is it? [[01:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5518.64s)]
*  It's crazy, yeah. [[01:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5519.4800000000005s)]
*  Because you get to see, first of all, [[01:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5520.320000000001s)]
*  that dude, Cillian Murphy, that guy's incredible. [[01:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5523.08s)]
*  He's incredible. [[01:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5527.240000000001s)]
*  Yeah, he's good. [[01:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5528.56s)]
*  That's the dude from the Peaky Blinders. [[01:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5529.400000000001s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[01:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5530.72s)]
*  He's so good. [[01:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5531.56s)]
*  He's such a good actor. [[01:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5532.52s)]
*  And so he nailed this tortured genius Oppenheimer [[01:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5534.84s)]
*  and this creation that he made. [[01:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5539.56s)]
*  It'd be so scary, something you thought was probably [[01:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5541.4800000000005s)]
*  for a purpose in the beginning [[01:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5543.72s)]
*  and then you changed your mind during it. [[01:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5544.96s)]
*  Also, you have to do it, because if you don't do it, [[01:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5546.24s)]
*  if the Germans get it, they're gonna kill everybody. [[01:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5548.48s)]
*  Still wounded and heavily bandaged, [[01:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5552.12s)]
*  Yamaguchi returned to work on August 9th, [[01:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5554.32s)]
*  the day Nagasaki was bombed. [[01:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5556.599999999999s)]
*  He was providing his supervisor a detailed account [[01:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5559.2s)]
*  of the Hiroshima bombing when the landscape [[01:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5561.72s)]
*  outside the office suddenly lit up in a blinding light [[01:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5563.84s)]
*  and Yamaguchi felt the floor as shock waves [[01:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5567.08s)]
*  destroyed the windows. [[01:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5569.44s)]
*  Suddenly, the same white light filled the room, [[01:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5570.96s)]
*  he later recalled. [[01:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5573.0s)]
*  I thought the mushroom cloud had followed me from Hiroshima. [[01:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5574.12s)]
*  Wow. [[01:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5577.76s)]
*  That's crazy. [[01:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5580.2s)]
*  Actually, you just gotta shh. [[01:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5581.04s)]
*  When you talk about it, it happens again. [[01:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5581.88s)]
*  That's crazy. [[01:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5583.16s)]
*  A reinforced stairwell in the office [[01:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5584.84s)]
*  protected the conference room [[01:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5586.04s)]
*  where Yamaguchi and his colleagues were. [[01:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5587.32s)]
*  Jesus Christ. [[01:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5588.76s)]
*  They just heard his story and he says, [[01:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5591.32s)]
*  someone took cover in a manner similar [[01:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5593.84s)]
*  to how he described in Hiroshima. [[01:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5595.36s)]
*  His wife was soaked in black rain and was poisoned, [[01:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5597.12s)]
*  as their daughter later recalled. [[01:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5600.5199999999995s)]
*  In the subsequent weeks, Yamaguchi suffered [[01:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5602.12s)]
*  high fever, severe hair loss, continuous vomiting, [[01:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5604.8s)]
*  and other symptoms from radiation poisoning. [[01:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5606.92s)]
*  Motherfucker, dude. [[01:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5609.6s)]
*  How much would have to happen in America [[01:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5611.6s)]
*  for things to get to a place where people are just like, [[01:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5613.4800000000005s)]
*  every man for himself? [[01:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5616.4800000000005s)]
*  Do you feel like? [[01:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5617.76s)]
*  Like that, like that kind of thing. [[01:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5618.6s)]
*  Power going out, yeah. [[01:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5619.88s)]
*  What keeps us together is electricity right now, [[01:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5622.16s)]
*  the way society is structured. [[01:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5624.64s)]
*  We are so dependent upon electricity [[01:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5626.12s)]
*  that without electricity, we don't have anything. [[01:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5628.52s)]
*  We don't have any cooling. [[01:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5630.52s)]
*  We have no ice. [[01:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5631.8s)]
*  We have no way of processing water. [[01:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5632.8s)]
*  We're fucked. [[01:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5637.0s)]
*  Without electricity, we have no transportation. [[01:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5637.84s)]
*  We're really fucked without electricity. [[01:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5640.08s)]
*  Electricity without oil, without any fuel at all, [[01:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5643.0s)]
*  we're doomed. [[01:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5646.08s)]
*  We're fucking doomed and all we have is burning things. [[01:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5647.2s)]
*  And do you think for the first day, [[01:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5650.400000000001s)]
*  people would be kind of organized, [[01:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5651.96s)]
*  like let's see what happens here watching the news [[01:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5653.2s)]
*  and then the second day, shit would get AWOL? [[01:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5654.88s)]
*  Like how quick would people? [[01:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5656.64s)]
*  As soon as people ran out of food, [[01:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5658.400000000001s)]
*  and that doesn't take long. [[01:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5660.52s)]
*  That's a few days. [[01:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5662.240000000001s)]
*  It's a few days. [[01:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5664.360000000001s)]
*  And then everyone's like, [[01:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5665.6s)]
*  oh, I'm gonna get a rifle, learn how to hunt. [[01:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5666.72s)]
*  Good luck. [[01:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5668.400000000001s)]
*  Not at the last minute. [[01:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5669.52s)]
*  What are you gonna put an ad at the last minute? [[01:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5670.56s)]
*  Sorry it's so late guys. [[01:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5672.200000000001s)]
*  Need to learn how to hunt or whatever. [[01:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5673.8s)]
*  But now by the way, if everybody goes hunting, [[01:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5675.4400000000005s)]
*  here's the dirty secret about hunting. [[01:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5677.4400000000005s)]
*  The reason why hunting works is because everybody [[01:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5679.320000000001s)]
*  doesn't hunt. [[01:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5681.0s)]
*  If everybody hunted, there'd be no more animals. [[01:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5681.96s)]
*  They almost did that in the 1800s, man. [[01:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5684.160000000001s)]
*  They started doing what they call market hunting. [[01:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5686.52s)]
*  And market hunting almost wiped out [[01:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5688.84s)]
*  everything in this country. [[01:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5691.72s)]
*  Almost wiped out all the elk, wiped out most of the buffalo, [[01:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5692.88s)]
*  almost wiped out white tailed deer. [[01:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5696.8s)]
*  Really? [[01:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5698.64s)]
*  Yeah man, because people were hunting them. [[01:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5699.4800000000005s)]
*  They could hunt as much as they wanted? [[01:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5701.64s)]
*  As much as they wanted, there was no regulation, [[01:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5702.76s)]
*  and they were selling the meat, [[01:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5704.56s)]
*  and there was no refrigeration. [[01:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5705.96s)]
*  So you have to kill them all the time. [[01:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5707.6s)]
*  So they would hire professional hunters, [[01:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5709.4400000000005s)]
*  and that's how they would get their meat. [[01:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5711.56s)]
*  And they were just devastating populations of animals. [[01:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5712.64s)]
*  I mean, you've seen the piles of buffalo bones, right? [[01:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5715.76s)]
*  Terrifying. [[01:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5719.08s)]
*  They killed millions of buffalo in a few years. [[01:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5720.04s)]
*  They brought the herds down to nothing in a few years. [[01:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5723.0s)]
*  Got that close to total extinction. [[01:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5726.320000000001s)]
*  And was that because people were like expanding west [[01:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5728.84s)]
*  and they needed food? [[01:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5730.88s)]
*  They needed food, they needed the skins, [[01:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5731.92s)]
*  they wanted the tongues. [[01:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5734.360000000001s)]
*  Pickled tongues was a big delicacy on the East Coast. [[01:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5735.88s)]
*  So it would shoot them for their tongue only, [[01:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5738.6s)]
*  which is crazy. [[01:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5740.360000000001s)]
*  So you take one of the biggest animals [[01:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5741.68s)]
*  that lives in North America, [[01:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5743.84s)]
*  and you're slaughtering it just for the smallest organ, [[01:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5745.08s)]
*  or the smallest thing, their tongue. [[01:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5748.4800000000005s)]
*  Yeah, so people did that already. [[01:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5751.72s)]
*  And if there's no power, there's not enough food. [[01:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5754.24s)]
*  There's just not. [[01:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5757.24s)]
*  We don't have enough wild game [[01:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5758.6s)]
*  for 330 million people for a year. [[01:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5760.08s)]
*  Forget about forever. [[01:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5762.68s)]
*  We don't, huh? [[01:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5763.76s)]
*  We don't. [[01:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5764.6s)]
*  We definitely don't. [[01:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5765.4800000000005s)]
*  We definitely 100% don't. [[01:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5767.0s)]
*  And the only reason why you can have [[01:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5768.68s)]
*  these giant populations of people like Los Angeles, [[01:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5770.16s)]
*  the only way you can have that is farmers. [[01:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5773.2s)]
*  You have to have farmers. [[01:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5775.48s)]
*  You have to have people that are fucking fully dedicated [[01:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5776.48s)]
*  24 hours a day to growing animals and food [[01:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5778.4s)]
*  all the time to supply those people. [[01:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5781.04s)]
*  So if you looked at the amount of farmers [[01:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5783.44s)]
*  versus the amount of people that they feed, it's crazy. [[01:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5785.12s)]
*  Oh, that's a great point how exponential it probably is. [[01:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5788.36s)]
*  Crazy. [[01:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5790.48s)]
*  So if all that's gone, [[01:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5791.76s)]
*  then all those people have no food. [[01:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5793.28s)]
*  And then where are they getting it? [[01:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5795.24s)]
*  Are they gonna be willing to, [[01:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5797.4s)]
*  how are they gonna learn how to herd cattle? [[01:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5799.88s)]
*  And the farmers are gonna be sitting there [[01:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5802.2s)]
*  licking their chops. [[01:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5803.68s)]
*  Well, they're gonna be killed most likely. [[01:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5804.96s)]
*  Oh, people are gonna try to get them for their food. [[01:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5806.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5808.72s)]
*  But the farmers will be ready. [[01:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5809.5599999999995s)]
*  For a while. [[01:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5810.88s)]
*  How long can you hold off millions of people with guns? [[01:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5813.04s)]
*  United States has more guns than most of the world. [[01:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5816.32s)]
*  We have 40% of the firearms on earth. [[01:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5819.12s)]
*  Fuck yeah. [[01:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5823.5599999999995s)]
*  We can, they can do it for a while, I guess. [[01:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5824.4s)]
*  See if that statistic is true. [[01:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5827.5599999999995s)]
*  I believe it is. [[01:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5828.8s)]
*  I think the American people have an exponential number [[01:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5829.92s)]
*  in comparison to every other country. [[01:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5834.92s)]
*  We have so much more weapons than any other country. [[01:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5837.08s)]
*  And I think we have more guns than the entire Chinese army [[01:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5839.400000000001s)]
*  by a large. [[01:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5842.68s)]
*  No way, really? [[01:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5843.52s)]
*  Yeah, by a large amount. [[01:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5844.36s)]
*  They just, the American population has more guns. [[01:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5845.6s)]
*  It's so embedded in our culture. [[01:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5848.6s)]
*  Cause I'll meet people sometimes in like, [[01:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5849.8s)]
*  you guys have all the guns. [[01:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5851.32s)]
*  It's like, what do you, [[01:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5852.4800000000005s)]
*  there's no way to not have guns here. [[01:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5853.32s)]
*  Well, there's more guns than there are people here. [[01:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5855.8s)]
*  But how would you even do it if somebody were like, [[01:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5857.36s)]
*  you should get rid of gun, right? [[01:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5859.28s)]
*  Cause you hear people say that sometimes. [[01:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5860.24s)]
*  Well, you're not gonna get rid of guns altogether. [[01:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5861.8s)]
*  You're not gonna eliminate the technology, right? [[01:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5863.88s)]
*  So the technology, if it exists, [[01:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5866.4s)]
*  someone's gonna have the guns. [[01:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5867.719999999999s)]
*  Who's gonna have those guns? [[01:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5868.92s)]
*  Well, you're gonna have the government's [[01:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5870.04s)]
*  gonna have the guns. [[01:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5871.2s)]
*  So you're basically giving the guns to people [[01:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5872.04s)]
*  that are known liars, [[01:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5873.639999999999s)]
*  who've been manipulating and controlling people [[01:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5874.92s)]
*  from the beginning of time. [[01:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5876.8s)]
*  You can't have that. [[01:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5878.24s)]
*  And the reason why the United States has such a unique [[01:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5879.08s)]
*  freedom is because the First Amendment is protected [[01:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5882.08s)]
*  by the Second Amendment. [[01:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5886.04s)]
*  Didn't Chris Rock have a bit about that? [[01:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5887.8s)]
*  I believe he did. [[01:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5889.6s)]
*  I'm not sure if he did. [[01:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5891.4800000000005s)]
*  I believe Chris Rock had a bit about that. [[01:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5892.320000000001s)]
*  He probably did. [[01:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5893.16s)]
*  I think he did. [[01:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5894.24s)]

*  What's up, Jamie? [[01:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5897.320000000001s)]
*  35 to 50% of the guns, [[01:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5898.16s)]
*  somewhere in the range of 270 million [[01:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5900.64s)]
*  out of the 645 million total. [[01:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5902.76s)]
*  Guns in America? [[01:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5907.04s)]

*  That's big estimates. [[01:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5909.2s)]

*  protecting that little dog. [[01:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5920.84s)]
*  Dogs used to be there to protect us. [[01:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5922.24s)]

*  We need to protect Carl. [[01:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5937.4s)]
*  He can't protect us. [[01:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5938.599999999999s)]
*  That's how soft people have gotten. [[01:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5939.599999999999s)]
*  We gotta listen to him snoring. [[01:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5942.599999999999s)]
*  Can you hear him? [[01:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5946.04s)]

*  It's so cool. [[01:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5955.96s)]
*  I was telling Joey for a while, [[01:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5956.8s)]
*  I orchestrated getting the two of them together [[01:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5957.72s)]
*  at the mothership. [[01:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5959.32s)]
*  I'm like, I've gotta get you guys together. [[01:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5960.16s)]

*  I'm like, Joey, you guys gotta bring the band back. [[01:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5963.04s)]
*  He goes, we're gonna, we're gonna, we're gonna. [[01:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5965.08s)]
*  Joey and Lee in California, when they had that show, [[01:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5968.08s)]
*  it was in this weird little office building. [[01:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5972.8s)]
*  It was so bizarre. [[01:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5975.44s)]
*  You'd park out there. [[01:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5976.28s)]
*  You'd be lucky to find a spot. [[01:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5977.48s)]
*  It had a really 80s vibe out there. [[01:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5978.839999999999s)]
*  They had one kind of neon kind of light [[01:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5981.4s)]
*  that was kind of like, they'd have their door [[01:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5983.639999999999s)]
*  for their office open a little bit. [[01:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5985.92s)]
*  And it didn't seem like it was an office. [[01:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5987.799999999999s)]
*  It seemed like it was a place where they shot [[01:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5989.24s)]
*  kind of quick porn over. [[01:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5991.16s)]
*  Did you ever see the one episode [[01:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5992.4s)]
*  where they had an office building at one point in time [[01:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5993.879999999999s)]
*  with a bunch of other people that had office buildings [[01:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5995.92s)]
*  and Joey was too loud and they were yelling at him [[01:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5997.639999999999s)]
*  to be quiet. [[01:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=5999.92s)]
*  He was like, shut the fuck up. [[01:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=6000.759999999999s)]
*  Really? [[01:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=6002.0s)]
*  No, it was amazing. [[01:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=6004.84s)]
*  We used to share a wall with a nail salon for a while. [[01:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=6007.24s)]
*  Really? [[01:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=6009.92s)]
*  Yeah, and they'd always be chattering in there [[01:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=6010.76s)]
*  and yelling about stuff. [[01:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=6012.52s)]
*  It was fun. [[01:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=6013.44s)]
*  Oh, that's okay. [[01:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=6014.28s)]
*  Some of that was fun, dude. [[01:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=6015.1s)]
*  I remember we used to share a wall with a fighter [[01:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=6015.94s)]
*  and the kid for a while and that was so much fun. [[01:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=6017.48s)]
*  We'd bang on the wall at each other. [[01:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=6019.68s)]
*  Well, you guys had, like, there was a bunch of podcasts [[01:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=6020.92s)]
*  that were being done in like a couple areas [[01:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=6022.64s)]
*  like that in California where they had little podcast studio [[01:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=6025.12s)]
*  places where several sets would be. [[01:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=6028.24s)]
*  It was so much fun. [[01:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=6030.16s)]
*  Those guys, they'd always ran into some money problem. [[01:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=6031.04s)]
*  There was always like some producer [[01:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=6033.68s)]
*  that was taking too much money [[01:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=6035.08s)]
*  and they wanted to control the show [[01:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=6036.42s)]
*  and I ran into so many dudes that had podcast deals [[01:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=6038.14s)]
*  that went south and it was again, the same kind of thing, [[01:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=6042.28s)]
*  power and corruption. [[01:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=6045.3s)]
*  There was so many guys who had podcast deals [[01:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=6047.16s)]
*  and then the people that they did this, [[01:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=6049.48s)]
*  that had this network wound up owning their podcast [[01:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=6052.04s)]
*  and selling their podcast and they were like, [[01:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=6054.52s)]
*  what the fuck, they just got robbed. [[01:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=6055.76s)]

*  You got literally robbed. [[01:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=6059.36s)]
*  But we still had ownership, you know? [[01:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=6061.56s)]
*  Yeah, but they stole your ad revenue, right? [[01:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=6063.68s)]
*  Yeah, for a year. [[01:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=6065.76s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, there was a lot of dirty business [[01:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=6067.280000000001s)]
*  in the podcast world. [[01:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=6068.96s)]
*  It was dark. [[01:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=6069.8s)]
*  Well, it's the Wild West, right? [[01:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=6070.64s)]
*  It was a completely new thing and all of a sudden, [[01:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=6071.92s)]
*  when the Money Spigot opened, it just opened like, woo! [[01:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=6074.0s)]
*  Like, I made no money for like five years. [[01:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=6077.4800000000005s)]
*  I just did it for funsies [[01:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=6080.280000000001s)]
*  and then all of a sudden, the Spigot just opened. [[01:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=6082.0s)]

*  in interesting content? [[01:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=6110.04s)]

*  was playing pool and going to pool halls. [[01:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=6262.32s)]

*  Oh, that's sweet. [[01:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=6587.66s)]
*  It was adorable. [[01:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=6588.5s)]
*  That's what he's gonna do. [[01:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=6589.339999999999s)]
*  He's gonna do that for people. [[01:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=6590.179999999999s)]
*  Same thing. [[01:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=6591.0s)]
*  I wanna suck your cock. [[01:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=6591.839999999999s)]
*  Daddy loves you. [[01:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=6592.679999999999s)]
*  I wanna suck your cock. [[01:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=6595.379999999999s)]
*  Hey. [[01:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=6597.179999999999s)]
*  Hey. [[01:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=6598.0199999999995s)]
*  What you doing with all that cut? [[01:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=6598.86s)]
*  I think this is his copy. [[01:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=6603.46s)]
*  Take me to the river. [[01:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=6605.299999999999s)]
*  I'm looking around just Twitter [[01:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=6606.7s)]
*  and he tweeted that yesterday. [[01:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=6608.419999999999s)]
*  No, he didn't. [[01:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=6609.96s)]
*  Look at that. [[01:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=6610.799999999999s)]
*  I'm gonna post, comment, and tag anyone [[01:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=6611.62s)]
*  if you can show support right now more than ever. [[01:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=6613.5s)]
*  Why am I in the back? [[01:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=6616.26s)]
*  Is that really true? [[01:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=6618.0199999999995s)]
*  That's a real photo. [[01:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=6618.98s)]
*  You don't forget it happening? [[01:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=6619.82s)]
*  You don't remember that podcast? [[01:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=6621.3s)]
*  That was right after you did Bernie Sanders. [[01:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=6623.66s)]
*  That guy came in. [[01:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=6625.0199999999995s)]
*  What is it like for you? [[01:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=6628.14s)]
*  Can I ask you this? [[01:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=6629.26s)]
*  You're interviewing legitimate people now. [[01:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=6630.3s)]
*  You interviewed Trump. [[01:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=6633.04s)]
*  You interviewed Bernie Sanders. [[01:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=6634.46s)]
*  You interviewed, who else? [[01:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=6637.12s)]
*  JD Walsh. [[01:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=6639.54s)]
*  Who else did you interview? [[01:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=6640.5s)]
*  You've interviewed a lot of very interesting people. [[01:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=6642.38s)]
*  Are you enjoying that? [[01:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=6644.82s)]
*  Yeah, I think I am, man. [[01:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=6646.3s)]
*  I think I've been trying to learn more. [[01:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=6647.54s)]
*  So that's been one of my goals. [[01:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=6649.94s)]
*  You're doing a great job. [[01:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=6651.1s)]
*  Thanks, John. [[01:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=6652.26s)]
*  You get silly, you're still yourself. [[01:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=6653.1s)]
*  You're still silly, but you're having real conversations [[01:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=6654.74s)]
*  with these people. [[01:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=6656.94s)]
*  Thanks. [[01:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=6657.76s)]
*  Bobby Kennedy. [[01:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=6658.6s)]
*  Yeah, for sure. [[01:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=6660.02s)]
*  I knew Bobby, which was lucky, [[01:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=6661.22s)]
*  and we were going through Vermont [[01:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=6662.82s)]
*  and Bernie said he would come on the podcast, [[01:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=6664.5s)]
*  so that was super fortunate. [[01:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=6666.02s)]
*  And then Dana helped. [[01:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=6667.74s)]
*  I wanted to talk to Trump [[01:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=6670.74s)]
*  because his brother had died of alcoholism [[01:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=6671.58s)]
*  and it was a world that I had spent a lot of my life [[01:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=6673.3s)]
*  in and dealing with. [[01:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=6676.86s)]
*  And so I wanted to just see if he was normal [[01:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=6677.9s)]
*  about something like that, I guess. [[01:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=6682.179999999999s)]
*  So yeah, but I think it's been interesting. [[01:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=6683.86s)]
*  I think I felt like a lot of responsibility. [[01:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=6686.179999999999s)]
*  I started to have some ego issues, I think. [[01:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=6688.78s)]
*  I was just trying to be like, [[01:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=6690.9s)]
*  just know what you're doing, man. [[01:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=6693.58s)]
*  You don't have some big responsibility. [[01:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=6695.74s)]
*  I think I had this ego trap where it made me feel, [[01:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=6698.16s)]
*  I just had to kind of manage some stuff for a little bit. [[01:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=6700.72s)]
*  But I've been feeling better now. [[01:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=6703.08s)]
*  I think- [[01:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=6704.12s)]
*  Like what was the trap? [[01:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=6704.94s)]
*  I think you just start to think, [[01:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=6706.94s)]
*  oh, well, I'm important, right? [[01:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=6708.12s)]
*  And it's okay if I have importance to myself [[01:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=6709.88s)]
*  and there's things that I want to examine [[01:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=6713.48s)]
*  and learn for myself and that sort of thing. [[01:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=6716.639999999999s)]
*  But your role as an important person. [[01:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=6718.98s)]
*  Right. [[01:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=6720.92s)]
*  You started thinking about that [[01:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=6721.76s)]
*  because you're getting a lot of views. [[01:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=6722.58s)]
*  Right, I think it started to just scare me. [[01:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=6723.599999999999s)]
*  So I got nervous and then I had people [[01:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=6725.24s)]
*  that would ask me about stuff [[01:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=6727.36s)]
*  that I felt like I didn't know about [[01:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=6728.679999999999s)]
*  or people would think that I knew more than I did [[01:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=6729.94s)]
*  or I had something to do with the election. [[01:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=6733.139999999999s)]
*  Things like that made me super kind of nervous. [[01:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=6735.2s)]
*  Got it, yeah. [[01:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=6738.0s)]
*  And so I think I just was trying to manage that for a bit. [[01:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=6738.839999999999s)]
*  But I've been feeling better about it [[01:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=6742.12s)]
*  and I know some places are things to be funny. [[01:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=6744.36s)]
*  Some places are things that mean something to me. [[01:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=6746.24s)]
*  Just learning about healthcare and people getting screwed. [[01:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=6749.219999999999s)]
*  There are some smaller causes. [[01:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=6752.0199999999995s)]
*  I can't learn about everything, [[01:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=6753.5599999999995s)]
*  but there's some things that I do care about [[01:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=6754.719999999999s)]
*  that I can seek more information about. [[01:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=6756.36s)]
*  Right. [[01:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=6759.679999999999s)]
*  And then to just try to get more interested in things. [[01:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=6760.5199999999995s)]
*  Just be, learn about, [[01:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=6762.799999999999s)]
*  wanna open myself up to learn about more things. [[01:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=6765.28s)]
*  That's the key, knowing when to just listen, [[01:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=6768.48s)]
*  when to try to be funny, just fuck around. [[01:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=6771.48s)]
*  Learn how to be yourself. [[01:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=6774.5599999999995s)]
*  The more you do them, the more relaxed you get [[01:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=6776.36s)]
*  when you do them. [[01:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=6778.0s)]
*  Yeah, that happens too. [[01:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=6779.44s)]
*  This is probably the most relaxed [[01:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=6780.839999999999s)]
*  I've felt like being around you today. [[01:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=6781.88s)]
*  Around me. [[01:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=6784.28s)]
*  I think I just like, [[01:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=6785.12s)]
*  yeah, sometimes you get nervous. [[01:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=6787.44s)]
*  Do you get nervous just because so many people are listening? [[01:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=6789.44s)]
*  Is that what it is? [[01:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=6791.44s)]
*  The numbers? [[01:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=6792.4s)]
*  Yeah, I think at first. [[01:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=6793.32s)]
*  And then I think, yeah, I mean, I look up to you. [[01:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=6794.64s)]
*  I think it's so like, you know, [[01:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=6797.28s)]
*  and you're the champ, you're the best. [[01:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=6799.28s)]
*  And so it's like, I don't know if it's a ner, [[01:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=6801.92s)]
*  I don't know what it is, [[01:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=6804.8s)]
*  but sometimes I feel some thing, you know? [[01:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=6805.62s)]
*  Well, thank you, but you don't need to. [[01:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=6808.44s)]
*  You don't need to feel that. [[01:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=6809.92s)]
*  You and I have been friends for a long fucking time. [[01:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=6811.16s)]
*  You could be yourself. [[01:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=6812.96s)]
*  You remind me of that and I appreciate it. [[01:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=6813.84s)]
*  Because it does help. [[01:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=6815.76s)]
*  I think it's just like an old thing of like, [[01:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=6816.84s)]
*  it's like an old energy thing [[01:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=6819.4400000000005s)]
*  that doesn't make any sense anymore. [[01:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=6820.6s)]
*  You know? [[01:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=6822.4400000000005s)]
*  But sometimes like that template is still there a little bit. [[01:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=6823.28s)]
*  Right, right. [[01:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=6825.56s)]
*  Well, that's a Hollywood template, right? [[01:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=6826.400000000001s)]
*  Like the people that are more established and bigger. [[01:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=6828.2s)]
*  It's like, oh, there's Johnny Carson. [[01:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=6830.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=6832.28s)]
*  You know, there's that, you know, gets. [[01:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=6833.12s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[01:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=6834.16s)]
*  Yeah, you always, [[01:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=6835.4800000000005s)]
*  anytime I think that way, [[01:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=6836.4800000000005s)]
*  you always bring it back down to a super normal place. [[01:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=6837.4800000000005s)]
*  So thank you. [[01:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=6839.88s)]
*  But it should be super normal. [[01:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=6841.68s)]
*  That's really the appeal of all this that we do [[01:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=6843.08s)]
*  is that it is super normal. [[01:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=6845.32s)]
*  Is that a guy like you can have no pretense [[01:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=6846.5199999999995s)]

*  Yeah, even seeing Shane, seeing Shane for literally, [[01:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=6937.320000000001s)]

*  Right away. [[01:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=6946.56s)]
*  And so even earlier, we go back to, [[01:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=6947.38s)]
*  you're like, I got Shane Gillis back here. [[01:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=6949.52s)]
*  I thought you were, it was like a new beverage [[01:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=6951.24s)]
*  or something he had made. [[01:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=6952.76s)]
*  And so I go back and there's a sauna back there by your gym. [[01:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=6954.16s)]
*  We never saw the gym before. [[01:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=6958.0s)]
*  I can't believe you never saw the gym. [[01:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=6959.32s)]

*  Yeah, the gym's great, [[01:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=6962.32s)]
*  but I didn't think he had a Shane Gillis on tap. [[01:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=6963.24s)]
*  So we fucking go in there [[01:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=6965.84s)]
*  and there's a meat closet where you're drying aged beef. [[01:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=6967.719999999999s)]
*  I actually do have one of those. [[01:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=6971.48s)]
*  Of course. [[01:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=6972.759999999999s)]

*  of Shane Gillis hanging in that bitch. [[01:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=6977.16s)]
*  And he just puts his head up near the glass [[01:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=6979.5599999999995s)]
*  and that moment alone, like, oh, that was the best. [[01:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=6981.44s)]
*  Does it make you want to move here? [[01:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7shjsOnamU&t=6984.599999999999s)]
