*  You're a doctor of [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=94.88s)]
*  Well, I'm an MD. So okay. I'm a physician [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=97.44s)]
*  And I'm and a physician is what just a doctor a medical doctor [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=101.67999999999999s)]
*  I'm a doctor of medicine and I'm a doctor of medicine [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=106.47999999999999s)]
*  I'm a doctor of medicine and I'm a doctor of medicine [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=109.52s)]
*  And [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=111.72s)]
*  I'm and a physician is what just a doctor a medical doctor like you go to four years of medical school after college and okay [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=113.44s)]
*  That's not like dr. Dre. That's not no, no, it's it's like the [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=120.28s)]
*  in the United States, you know, the MD is sort of the [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=124.8s)]
*  What people think of when they think of physician those are you know, that's the standard process you go to medical school [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=128.68s)]
*  Okay, then you usually do a residency to sort of sub specialize into a different area of training [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=135.04s)]
*  Okay, and then you go to work and [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=140.68s)]
*  So these days you're working in a ketamine [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=145.72s)]
*  How did you get working in a ketamine therapy and like where are you at with it right now? Like [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=148.0s)]
*  Are you actually practicing it? Are you running a practice that provides? [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=152.64s)]
*  the therapy to people so both [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=157.68s)]
*  I [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=161.51999999999998s)]
*  was [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=162.68s)]
*  It's kind of one of those [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=164.07999999999998s)]
*  Long routes to get back to where you started [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=167.24s)]
*  and I [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=170.88s)]
*  Originally trained as a general surgeon a long time ago [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=172.24s)]
*  and then I went into anesthesia and I did that for about a decade and [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=177.35999999999999s)]
*  Ketamine therapy [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=182.28s)]
*  Sort of became [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=184.6s)]
*  More studied as a result of its use in anesthesia and [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=189.04s)]
*  Because it's an anesthesia medication, but it had some interesting side effects that they they looked at over time [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=194.76s)]
*  that they couldn't explain and [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=200.04s)]
*  That research is what has brought us to [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=202.72s)]
*  ketamine therapy today in the use of [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=205.92s)]
*  treatment resistant [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=210.28s)]
*  depression and other you know [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=212.35999999999999s)]
*  Mental health problems. What exactly is it used to treat the therapy? [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=216.07999999999998s)]
*  So you can use it to treat a lot of different things. It depends on what you're doing with it [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=220.68s)]
*  The way it is used [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=226.04s)]
*  Most often is to help people who have had a lot of problems with depression who have failed [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=228.04s)]
*  a lot of other therapeutic approaches and so so what [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=235.0s)]
*  Ketamine offers is a new tool [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=240.88s)]
*  to [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=243.92s)]
*  Help people who are [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=245.95999999999998s)]
*  still suffering tremendously [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=248.72s)]
*  kind of springboard back onto the road of life and and [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=251.2s)]
*  It is [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=256.64s)]
*  It's really interesting that the way it works. It doesn't work like normal [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=258.64s)]
*  Antidepressant medicines it has nothing in common with them [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=263.71999999999997s)]
*  The way it's almost a new technology then I guess in approaching [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=267.24s)]
*  Treating depression so that the the easiest way to describe it is why they started studying it to begin with okay [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=272.8s)]
*  And that was back almost 20 years ago [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=279.59999999999997s)]
*  No, dang they they realized that when they gave ketamine to patients getting operations [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=282.6s)]
*  They required less narcotic pain medicine [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=288.8s)]
*  During the operation in the hospital and after the hospital stay [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=293.32s)]
*  Than than other patients. They said why is this just doesn't you know? Why are they having less pain? They had no explanation [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=297.88s)]
*  So they they looked at it and what they discovered was that what it does is it changes? [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=304.72s)]
*  Your perception of pain [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=310.8s)]
*  So you can see something that you've experienced as less painful [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=313.76s)]
*  Hence you don't need as much medication to cover your pain [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=320.12s)]
*  I see so you're not feeling as much pain because you're not seeing it [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=324.8s)]
*  You're not seeing the seed of whatever it was as as painful so therefore like the growth of the pain isn't as severe at that time [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=329.24s)]
*  The way the best way I like describe it to people is yeah, I have two daughters and in [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=337.4s)]
*  Say we go get flu shots and one daughter gets a flu shot and she's like ow and [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=343.44s)]
*  My other daughter she gets a flu shot and she's like and her response is much more. Okay, we know that the the shot is the same [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=348.08s)]
*  But the response is different. So one is perceiving something with more distress than the other and the way ketamine works is it helps [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=357.56s)]
*  Your pain sort of shift from that [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=367.71999999999997s)]
*  That more visceral response to a more that hurt, but I'm okay [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=371.52s)]
*  Response. Okay. It's a persp- it like it's like changing the lens on how you see pain [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=377.36s)]
*  so that you can see things and you can kind of look at them from a distance and sort of [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=383.12s)]
*  Go around things that have happened to you and you can kind of connect to yourself [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=389.71999999999997s)]
*  From those places and it's a it's [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=393.68s)]
*  It's not spiritual, but it's not far from it, right? [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=399.28000000000003s)]
*  Do you think it gives you like a look at yourself like you kind of see yourself? [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=402.44s)]
*  Whereas a lot of us have a tough time seeing ourselves because we're in ourselves, you know, exactly. Yes 100% because [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=407.56s)]
*  It's like if you're on the playing field [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=414.4s)]
*  You can't really see what's going on and it sort of puts you up in the stands of your life [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=417.4s)]
*  That's interesting and you have a lot of places in your past or a lot of patients that have come to me is [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=423.12s)]
*  you know, you're living your life and [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=428.92s)]
*  life's hard and [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=431.56s)]
*  people get hurt and [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=433.48s)]
*  Depending on where they are in their life [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=436.76s)]
*  They sort of package that up and they put it away because they don't want to feel that anymore [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=438.2s)]
*  But it doesn't really go away. And so [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=443.44s)]
*  Those those let's call them firewalls [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=446.6s)]
*  There are no-go places in your brain [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=450.0s)]
*  But they're still sort of resonating through your existence. So they're shaping [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=452.40000000000003s)]
*  typically [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=457.52000000000004s)]
*  Your relationships in your career, right? And that's like that [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=458.72s)]
*  that [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=463.92s)]
*  What is that movie? [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=465.12s)]
*  Kung Fu Panda, you know, I was thinking of Master Uguay and his [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=467.28000000000003s)]
*  We often find our destiny by trying to avoid it [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=473.36s)]
*  Oh, yeah, interesting. Yeah, I was thinking of that movie where that boat gets stuck in Boston [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=476.16s)]
*  You know I'm talking about where they go fishing. You know, I'm talking about [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=480.32000000000005s)]
*  And there's all the storm perfect storm. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Yeah [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=483.12s)]
*  I didn't have a good ending though [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=487.76000000000005s)]
*  Yeah, it didn't but um, so I see what you're saying [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=490.24s)]
*  So yeah, it kind of gives you an experience to step outside of yourself [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=493.76000000000005s)]
*  So were you able to see that whenever you was working in anesthesia? [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=496.16s)]
*  Were you able to see people having that experience agree able to visually? [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=498.8s)]
*  See that experience [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=503.36s)]
*  See that or were you not able to grasp kind of the concept of it of of exactly that until [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=505.84s)]
*  I'm guessing later which we haven't discussed yet until you got into actually [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=512.24s)]
*  experience in uh [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=516.38s)]
*  Using ketamine when I was when I was practicing anesthesia. Um [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=518.24s)]
*  I used to do that hitman anesthesia guys that hit me and that rolls in there [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=523.04s)]
*  That's the guy a lot of people some people don't even need they'll be like they just want the anesthesia some people [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=526.4s)]
*  I have a buddy who's addicted to um [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=531.6s)]
*  He was addicted to uh inoculations [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=535.2s)]
*  And he's breaking into walgreens and doing all the damn, uh [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=537.92s)]
*  Whatever it is the covid in the book. I don't know if it was cove is before this so he's just doing flu shots, you know [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=542.0s)]
*  But that's you know people get people get [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=548.48s)]
*  People get into certain things, you know, but um, anyway, I don't know. I told you that exactly [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=551.6s)]
*  But um what i'm trying to tell you right now is just that okay. So yeah, so [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=555.36s)]
*  Were you able to see stuff whenever you were working in as an anesthesiologist? [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=559.84s)]
*  Were you able to see some of that or was it more like that you got a a stronger idea to work with ketamine like [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=563.28s)]
*  And understand it later on what I noticed was that [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=570.24s)]
*  When we used it and we didn't use it a lot. I mean you just give them it as part of anesthesia. They did better [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=573.76s)]
*  So everything seemed to work better. They just sort of seemed more functional [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=580.16s)]
*  They had [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=584.8s)]
*  What we saw was they just they they felt better they they came out of it better [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=586.3199999999999s)]
*  They they got up they got around [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=591.44s)]
*  And um, and that was sort of how the ball got rolling on why is this happening? [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=593.7600000000001s)]
*  And then you know, then they started figuring out that hey, this is actually doing something in the brain [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=597.6s)]
*  for real not just some [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=603.12s)]
*  accident and [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=605.82s)]
*  Then they started [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=607.6s)]
*  Experimenting not experimenting but they started, you know using it in a more of a clinical sense for people who are really struggling [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=609.1s)]
*  Because before ketamine the really the only thing that they had [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=614.8800000000001s)]
*  was um [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=618.8000000000001s)]
*  Ect, you know putting electricity through your head, right? [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=620.08s)]
*  And I have taken care of a lot of patients with that and they did not like that [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=622.96s)]
*  And I can see why so what did you ever have to do that to people? I did actually [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=627.44s)]
*  I'm not not i'm not even familiar with that. Yeah, I I did it when I was an anesthesia [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=632.4000000000001s)]
*  resident about a decade ago, they they'd bring us a bunch of patients from the [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=638.32s)]
*  psychiatric hospital and they'd line them up and [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=643.26s)]
*  We put them to sleep and the psychiatrist would [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=646.08s)]
*  Shock their heads and we were like wide-eyed and like is this real and [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=649.0400000000001s)]
*  I guess it helped so you would put them to sleep first. Yeah, just very briefly [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=656.08s)]
*  So you just with a like propofol or something? Okay [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=660.88s)]
*  So you just you would just make them unconscious just for a few minutes [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=663.2800000000001s)]
*  And I remember this this the psychiatrist she had like this [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=666.5600000000001s)]
*  had a hair that was like huge and it was like gray and kind of [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=670.48s)]
*  Like back to the future style, yeah and uh, and she would [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=675.04s)]
*  she would put these probes on this guy on these guys heads and like [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=679.4399999999999s)]
*  and you know, we're kids and we're just like [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=684.3199999999999s)]
*  Okay [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=688.4s)]
*  Wow, and zap them decently. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=689.4399999999999s)]
*  Yeah, because we had to paralyze them because when you when you shocked them they'd be like [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=692.16s)]
*  And what was supposed to be happening? [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=696.4s)]
*  So my understanding is kind of bootleg, you know, my understanding is it actually helps a lot of people [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=698.24s)]
*  but it is not [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=704.0799999999999s)]
*  Riddle accessible. So we were doing this in a [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=706.56s)]
*  hospital in a recovery room with an anesthesia team [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=711.4399999999999s)]
*  In sort of the critical care area of the hospital, so that's not something that is accessible to [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=715.76s)]
*  99 of the population right any given day and and so that's sort of the problem so so so this [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=722.0s)]
*  electroconvulsive therapy this uh, [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=729.8199999999999s)]
*  In which small electric currents are passed through the brain triggering a brief seizure [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=732.3199999999999s)]
*  changes in the brain chemistry quickly reverse symptoms of certain mental health conditions. So this was [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=736.8s)]
*  This was almost [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=741.92s)]
*  This was kind of like a ketamine. This is ketamines kind of like that. No, okay [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=743.52s)]
*  No, this is what they were doing early on. This was the only alternative [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=748.9599999999999s)]
*  Okay, so you go to provide what? Uh relief from depression [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=753.1999999999999s)]
*  Okay, I see what you're saying because they still have a therapy [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=756.88s)]
*  I have friends that go and get electrocuted a little bit every day. Yeah. Yeah, so so that is sort of like the um, [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=759.76s)]
*  Oh, yeah, there's a good one. See that guy right there on the left. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah, he's going deep [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=767.36s)]
*  Yeah, that's what they did. He's got a candle in his mouth that dude's that's that's so when he bites down from the electricity [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=772.24s)]
*  He doesn't break his teeth. Oh my god [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=777.28s)]
*  Yeah, right [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=779.92s)]
*  You know, so it's hard that's frankensteinish. It's hard to get a lot of people to sign up for that because [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=781.84s)]
*  I mean you google it and you see that and you're like no i'll pass [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=786.72s)]
*  Yeah, they're grilling that brother up man. Unfortunately, that's pretty heavy. It seems like to me [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=790.5600000000001s)]
*  um [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=795.12s)]
*  so [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=796.48s)]
*  So how so how did they evolve out of this? So this isn't really practiced readily anymore [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=798.0s)]
*  It wasn't easy. You said there was you had to have a lot of people on site to do it. So ect [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=801.6800000000001s)]
*  Um is still used in limited form today. The the problem with it is it's a pretty big deal to do [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=807.2800000000001s)]
*  and so [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=815.2800000000001s)]
*  you don't have [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=816.48s)]
*  Doctors offices do an ect. These are special circumstances usually with patients who have profound problems [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=818.1600000000001s)]
*  usually patients who are in [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=825.2800000000001s)]
*  Uh inpatient psychiatric hospitals. These are not people who are [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=827.5s)]
*  Out walking trying to hold jobs. So this is a different [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=831.7600000000001s)]
*  Level different level, you know people who come and seek care for depression [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=836.96s)]
*  They they you know get talked to by their doctor their provider and they get [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=842.9s)]
*  You know put on a medication or something and they they go to a therapist and they try and work through that [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=846.98s)]
*  And usually at some point [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=852.34s)]
*  Um some people sort of hit the wall with that [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=855.0600000000001s)]
*  Not everybody but a lot of people are hitting the wall with it and what they do is with ect [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=858.4200000000001s)]
*  No with just just going to um, so almost no one gets referred for ect [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=863.62s)]
*  Yeah, that's I mean because that seems like yes you're saying that's more like in psych wards and stuff like that like bottom of the barrel [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=868.8199999999999s)]
*  Really? They're trying to jump start. I mean it looks like the damn lord's jumper cables [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=874.02s)]
*  It is it's it literally is it's like you're trying to jump off the brain [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=877.86s)]
*  Trying to get it hit to fire again. Yeah, and so that's like people who are like, you know in in hospitals [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=882.18s)]
*  Mostly people who are not holding down jobs people are not having [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=888.98s)]
*  Relationships because they can't okay, right [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=893.28s)]
*  So so so the rest of people who are struggling, you know, they go to their doctor they get put on antidepressants [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=896.5s)]
*  They go to a lot of therapy, right? That's me. That's been me. I'm an example of that [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=902.9799999999999s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, and so so you're you're sort of chugging along and and [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=906.9s)]
*  You're existing [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=911.9399999999999s)]
*  But you're not really, you know, if you look at like the road of life [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=913.62s)]
*  you want to be on the middle of it and you want to be [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=917.14s)]
*  Comfortably cruising down it, you know, and these are the people who they're like on the shoulder [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=920.9s)]
*  Or they fall off into this they go off and on the side of their shoulder and they they have a hard time pulling themselves [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=926.18s)]
*  Back up and it's because they're the the medicines they help [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=931.3s)]
*  But they don't necessarily get people to a place of [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=937.9399999999999s)]
*  Well-being that they're seeking. Mm-hmm. You know, there's there's [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=941.4599999999999s)]
*  Existing and then there's like really living [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=945.3599999999999s)]
*  Right. Yeah, I think I can definitely test testament to that. Yeah, I kind of feel like [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=948.5799999999999s)]
*  Like I don't understand one of the reasons I went to get the ketamine therapy is because I didn't know why i'm still on [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=954.58s)]
*  Antidepressants, it's like one of the weirdest medicines that you know [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=960.88s)]
*  I was having a tough time when I was like 20 and I went in they put it on they put me on it [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=964.02s)]
*  Or I agreed to be on it, you know, I mean I took part in it and and then [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=969.3s)]
*  Now 20 years later i'm still on it. So it's kind of like [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=974.26s)]
*  Like if you broke your leg, you wouldn't have a cast on forever probably [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=978.1s)]
*  So some of that to me is like what's going on here? [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=980.74s)]
*  Like is this something I need to be on forever? [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=983.14s)]
*  So that's one of the reasons that I went in probably to check it out, you know [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=985.22s)]
*  and you know, it's [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=989.14s)]
*  the work [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=991.7s)]
*  that is being done in this is [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=993.0600000000001s)]
*  Amazing I mean [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=996.9s)]
*  There are some very smart people who sort of helped shape this sort of treatment path and [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=999.54s)]
*  The way I I look at it [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=1007.46s)]
*  Is I look at people who come to me and they have all these symptoms they either they're depressed they're anxious they can't sleep [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=1010.4200000000001s)]
*  They're they have like attention problems. They they zone out because they can't zone in [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=1019.0600000000001s)]
*  Then you have people who like trying to kill themselves [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=1025.38s)]
*  Or they're addicted to things and what it really is is [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=1029.22s)]
*  Somewhere within them. They have a lot of pain [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=1032.74s)]
*  Okay, they have a lot of distress [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=1035.54s)]
*  Something is is primarily wrong [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=1037.94s)]
*  and [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=1041.78s)]
*  That is not going away with the antidepressants. They're just more like a band-aid [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=1042.82s)]
*  To it they're covering the symptom as opposed to addressing the symptom. Right? So the driver [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=1047.3799999999999s)]
*  is usually [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=1052.74s)]
*  Pain that is from somewhere in that person's past [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=1054.26s)]
*  That they have not been able to truly grieve over [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=1058.18s)]
*  And feel like sort of reconnected to themselves [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=1061.94s)]
*  and and [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=1064.98s)]
*  As you probably [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=1066.34s)]
*  experienced to some degree [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=1068.26s)]
*  When you went into the ketamine room [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=1070.5s)]
*  you [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=1073.06s)]
*  Could see your pain you could see [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=1074.26s)]
*  Around in yourself and you could kind of go places those those firewalls [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=1077.06s)]
*  You could kind of look in places that you couldn't look in before because you had the capacity to [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=1081.78s)]
*  You were sort of protected by the ketamine so you could look around corners in your mind and see [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=1086.82s)]
*  Oh, yeah [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=1092.5s)]
*  That's there [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=1093.6999999999998s)]
*  You know, I wish I'd had a better I was in there with a therapist [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=1095.46s)]
*  And I I think they were just more of like there if I had an issue [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=1099.14s)]
*  um [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=1104.3400000000001s)]
*  I sometimes wish that somebody would have been like prodding me more or telling me how to [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=1105.3s)]
*  It's almost like when you go snorkeling. That's what it kind of felt like a little bit [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=1111.38s)]
*  It was like i'm looking at [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=1115.54s)]
*  A lot was going on. You know if I felt like i'm a roller i'm on a roller coaster [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=1118.66s)]
*  I felt like the world is kind of felt like I was on space mountain sometimes with my eyes closed [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=1122.58s)]
*  You know just kind of like moving through like did you have the round shapes or the square shapes? [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=1127.06s)]
*  I mean, I I mean [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=1132.1s)]
*  I think there was a turf war going on because there was a lot of there was some real [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=1134.6599999999999s)]
*  I think it was a lot of shapes out there. You know, it was definitely like somebody was [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=1139.1399999999999s)]
*  um, I mean if I remember one time literally yelling out that I was a cryptocurrency, I thought I was [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=1143.3s)]
*  Just like I went it got pretty gnarly, you know, like it got pretty gnarly like I remember one time thinking [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=1148.58s)]
*  There's no way i'm going to end up back in my chair in this therapist office [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=1155.62s)]
*  I don't know how i'm going to get there from where I am [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=1159.22s)]
*  I've had some fun, you know [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=1163.22s)]
*  so that kind of stuff was kind of exciting and I think sometimes I got too caught looking at the the the the [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=1165.3799999999999s)]
*  Experience and not using the experience, right? [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=1171.1999999999998s)]
*  So that's why I wish that there had been more before I went in to get it that I had had more of an understanding of [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=1175.3s)]
*  How to navigate the universe a little bit and how to use the experience. Yeah [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=1182.82s)]
*  Because that I that I didn't have that that's sort of a um [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=1189.06s)]
*  So we're learning as we go, right? [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=1193.22s)]
*  And so what in this this is relatively recent [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=1195.3s)]
*  Um ketamine assisted psychotherapy. So what is it and and that's exactly what we're talking about is we know ketamine helps [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=1199.86s)]
*  We know it works [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=1206.18s)]
*  Do we know exactly how it works people are debating it because you have competing interests. You have competing ideologies [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=1207.3799999999999s)]
*  But we know that people [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=1213.94s)]
*  feel better [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=1216.58s)]
*  Now what we want to try and do [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=1218.1s)]
*  Is make that a more durable state [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=1220.1s)]
*  Not you come in and get your ketamine you feel good for a couple days and then you [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=1223.7s)]
*  You come back a month later and you get more ketamine because [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=1227.46s)]
*  That's going to present a societal problem in time [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=1230.66s)]
*  If you're if you're always on ketamine [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=1234.02s)]
*  You know, we've kind of done the opiate thing. So that that's one thing I [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=1236.58s)]
*  that is [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=1239.8600000000001s)]
*  We don't want to do because you have some places that are like giving you to go home with [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=1241.78s)]
*  and that is sort of like [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=1245.8600000000001s)]
*  Um [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=1249.78s)]
*  You can do a lot more with ketamine assisted psychotherapy you can use that place you're in [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=1252.42s)]
*  to visit [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=1257.7s)]
*  the pain [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=1259.54s)]
*  That has brought you to this distress state [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=1260.82s)]
*  Yeah, there was a moment. I remember [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=1263.8600000000001s)]
*  There was a moment where I got to see my dad be around my dad, right? [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=1266.1000000000001s)]
*  And i'd never my dad died when I was like 16 and he was really older man [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=1269.38s)]
*  He was 86 when he passed away and and I was 16 so he was older when I was born [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=1272.82s)]
*  He was an adult, you know, he was senior citizen [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=1276.66s)]
*  but um [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=1279.7s)]
*  I got to have like this experience around him [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=1281.3s)]
*  It was like a real like it felt like I was around him [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=1283.62s)]
*  and I got to let him I I got to [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=1287.9399999999998s)]
*  You know, I felt like my dad never knew how much I loved him [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=1291.6999999999998s)]
*  I felt like I had just never gotten to an age where I could tell him that I loved him, you know [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=1294.02s)]
*  And I didn't realize how much that was kind of haunting me. I think somewhere inside of me, you know, like um, [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=1299.4599999999998s)]
*  Exactly. I just never knew like that. That was such a big thing going on [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=1304.5s)]
*  underneath me somewhere and uh [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=1309.12s)]
*  And I literally got to have [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=1312.34s)]
*  a moment or a little bit a couple moments with him in a [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=1314.6599999999999s)]
*  Emotional state kind of it felt like anyway to me. It felt very real to me that I was letting him know [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=1319.12s)]
*  How much I loved him, you know, yeah and that [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=1326.26s)]
*  And that's priceless because there's no there was no other way to do that [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=1329.3799999999999s)]
*  I mean there may there may have been but I I hadn't found that yet. Yeah [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=1331.86s)]
*  that that is like [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=1336.98s)]
*  core to [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=1339.3799999999999s)]
*  what [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=1341.3s)]
*  Ketamine is psychotherapy gives people access to it's like those little gaps those little holes in our heart [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=1342.5s)]
*  That that happened to us when we're young [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=1348.74s)]
*  Shape a lot of our life [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=1351.54s)]
*  and so to be able to reach back in time [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=1354.02s)]
*  and [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=1356.82s)]
*  and find yourself then and there and that that sort of that [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=1357.62s)]
*  Grief pain of separation that you you didn't get to have with him. You could connect to yourself [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=1362.5s)]
*  And and sort of complete almost in a way like the grieving process so you could release [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=1369.22s)]
*  That tension from yourself. Yeah that that distress that's that's like that's [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=1374.5s)]
*  In there and it's always in there and it's [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=1379.7s)]
*  You don't know how to get it out [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=1382.98s)]
*  and you're pushing through life and a couple decades go by and you're like [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=1384.9s)]
*  I'm still haunted by things and some people are not [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=1389.3s)]
*  Able to even see some of those things [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=1393.14s)]
*  Because i've taken care of people [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=1395.7s)]
*  I mean i've taken care of some pretty funny people, you know [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=1398.02s)]
*  like I have [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=1401.14s)]
*  Trees on my in my room where I do it and they're like sitting there and they're you know [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=1403.3s)]
*  They're giggling and and then you know, they're like that tree just got up and ran out of here and i'm like, okay [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=1407.78s)]
*  And but then some of them [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=1412.98s)]
*  Started singing for me and then some people start like trying to do yoga poses in their chair [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=1414.9s)]
*  Really? I'm like i'm like you can't quite do that right now and right and they you know [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=1419.38s)]
*  So [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=1425.14s)]
*  No, I mean it's it gets a little wild [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=1426.34s)]
*  Well, I remember even being a child I remember getting something was wrong with my penis when I was young and they had to like [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=1428.18s)]
*  Like I had like a small urine hole or whatever. I mean I could pee probably [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=1434.18s)]
*  11 feet, you know what i'm saying? Like I could really pee [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=1438.26s)]
*  And it was people were like oh he's magic and stuff people, you know small town people think you're [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=1441.86s)]
*  you know with a rival church or something, you know all kind of shit, but [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=1446.5s)]
*  Um [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=1450.02s)]
*  So anyway, yeah, they said they had to cut the whole larger on my urethra, I think it's go urethra [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=1451.3s)]
*  so [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=1456.58s)]
*  I remember we went in they put my anesthesia and when I came out [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=1457.7s)]
*  I asked where all the big black women are at [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=1461.22s)]
*  and I remember the doctor telling my mom that like [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=1465.22s)]
*  We thought it was just the craziest thing and my mom had said that [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=1468.66s)]
*  Before when I was even younger [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=1473.14s)]
*  I'd had a surgery and I had a law a big black nurse was my nurse was the nurse [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=1474.42s)]
*  so I wonder if maybe there was just some moment that was like stuck in my head like through those little kind of deals, but [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=1478.98s)]
*  um [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=1484.98s)]
*  but anyway, I I don't know why I went off on this tangent, but um [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=1486.1s)]
*  I guess I just wanted to know like yeah, I guess is there [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=1490.58s)]
*  What's happening during the experience when somebody gets the ketamine? What's happening? [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=1493.86s)]
*  so [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=1498.74s)]
*  The way the way I do it is I I put a ivy in them so I can like [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=1500.34s)]
*  Turn it up and turn it down so you can slow down if they start getting overwhelmed [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=1504.82s)]
*  Okay, because sometimes people you can you can just see it, you know [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=1508.18s)]
*  they're like because it's like there lots coming at them and and i'm sitting there and and [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=1511.8600000000001s)]
*  you [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=1517.06s)]
*  they [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=1518.42s)]
*  tend to start having like their blood pressure and their heart rate go up because they're getting like they're seeing stuff and okay, so you [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=1519.22s)]
*  Want to kind of try to minimize that you want to make it? [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=1524.42s)]
*  constructive yet [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=1527.92s)]
*  Sufficient to [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=1531.54s)]
*  Like have the experience it can't be so low that you're like I didn't feel anything [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=1533.22s)]
*  Right, but you don't want to like, you know [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=1536.66s)]
*  Ruin them. I mean not ruin them, but you don't want to make it so overwhelming. It's no longer useful [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=1539.78s)]
*  Right. I see what you're saying. Yeah, so you want to kind of have a find a balance and um, yeah [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=1544.5800000000002s)]
*  That's what the one I did the place that I went they they they did it and then they kind of just it was a low dose [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=1548.74s)]
*  Until they kind of got to you to a level where they could where it seemed like it was manageable and effective [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=1553.94s)]
*  I guess to communicate with the therapist. Yeah, because what I do is you know [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=1559.6200000000001s)]
*  The way the research was done is you do six six infusions and I like to have them come in and I don't usually [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=1563.9399999999998s)]
*  Have somebody start ketamine right away [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=1571.02s)]
*  I usually want to talk to him because I want to know like their life narrative to some degree and then you kind of get [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=1572.86s)]
*  An idea where where the boundaries are like you can tell like I go through this thing where I'm like, okay, how was [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=1579.1799999999998s)]
*  You know, where'd you live? Where'd you move? How was that place? How was this place? How was first grade? [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=1587.02s)]
*  How was second grade and you keep going through it and [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=1592.5s)]
*  Things start popping up pretty fast and people don't realize what's in their head and then they're like, oh, yeah [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=1595.6200000000001s)]
*  I forgot about that and [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=1600.5s)]
*  But you can kind of tell and this is not in ketamine [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=1603.1000000000001s)]
*  This is just sort of getting to know them because you got to know what are you gonna do with the ketamine experience? [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=1605.18s)]
*  So I want to have like a roadmap right and and then as we do this [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=1609.5s)]
*  The first couple of sessions you want to get their their sort of like get everything chugging [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=1614.98s)]
*  You just want to get them into a better state of well-being so that their capacity [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=1619.6200000000001s)]
*  to examine some of these long-standing things is [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=1623.8200000000002s)]
*  Available to them. Okay, you don't want them to not be able to [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=1628.78s)]
*  To sort of explore this you want them to be in fighting good enough fighting shape that they're like I can do this [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=1632.74s)]
*  and [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=1640.02s)]
*  We go through it and I've had people [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=1641.22s)]
*  Who couldn't remember entire years of their lives? These are smart [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=1644.0600000000002s)]
*  very successful people [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=1648.7s)]
*  who who have been it's like something's been wrong their whole life and and you start going through it with them and [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=1650.7s)]
*  it keeps going back further and further and further and sort of like the the beginning of the flick of the wrist on that little [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=1659.18s)]
*  thread of pain and [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=1666.6200000000001s)]
*  a lot of times these little firewalls conceal it and [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=1668.94s)]
*  Then they have their ahas and they remember more and more and more and I'm not telling them what to remember [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=1672.54s)]
*  I'm just listening and so what are examples of some things right and what are some examples of so so [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=1677.3400000000001s)]
*  Well, what are some examples of things that people could remember kind of if you can share? [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=1683.5s)]
*  Um, and that you don't have to be specific to that person. Obviously, right? So I had a patient who [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=1687.3s)]
*  Had a series of moves that were sort of stressful on on him as a child and [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=1695.78s)]
*  It's [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=1702.94s)]
*  One of them after one of the moves he was [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=1704.86s)]
*  Very seriously disciplined by his by his dad [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=1710.2199999999998s)]
*  to such a degree that that [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=1715.1399999999999s)]
*  He didn't remember it until we sort of toggled the switches around it [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=1717.8999999999999s)]
*  And we started sort of gently like how is this location? He was like that was warm. That was nice [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=1722.02s)]
*  How was this location where you moved to I didn't like it? How was this house you lived in in this place? [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=1727.82s)]
*  I don't remember. How was this house? I remember not being happy. So already we're pointing to [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=1734.3s)]
*  Narrowing it narrowing it. Yeah, and he didn't remember in the ketamine session and then later that night he did [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=1740.9s)]
*  and so then we came back around the next time and we talked about it and we sort of work into the and [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=1748.5s)]
*  you know, I I [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=1754.82s)]
*  Approached this with I guess the right word is [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=1756.5s)]
*  Like a great deal of reverence, you know, these people are sharing with me [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=1758.86s)]
*  Their emotional pain and I'm helping or trying to help them connect to themselves so they can feel whole [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=1765.3s)]
*  Because all this all this distress that people have in a way [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=1773.1s)]
*  It's like incomplete grieving. Yeah, and people can't cry that much and [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=1777.1399999999999s)]
*  So they they sock it away and and what the ketamine does is it allows you an opportunity to kind of go back in places [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=1782.98s)]
*  That you can't do awake. You just can't yeah, I've seen that I've seen patients. I start talking and I'm you can tell they're like [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=1790.5s)]
*  They don't want to talk about it. You know, I had a lady [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=1797.46s)]
*  who I took care of who I [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=1800.98s)]
*  Was the first person she told in 40 years that she was raped in high school. Hmm [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=1804.1s)]
*  And she's you know, she's in her 60s and her life has been tough and [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=1808.18s)]
*  You know, so her life has been shaped by fear, right? [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=1815.46s)]
*  Yeah, I'm sure fear [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=1820.3s)]
*  Probably feeling like she couldn't tell people things shame and it shaped her relationship [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=1823.54s)]
*  So she was in you know, not the best relationships because she was [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=1828.66s)]
*  Put in the state by this experience that had shaped her ability to interact with life [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=1833.82s)]
*  Right and here we are 40 years later and she's a wonderful lady and [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=1839.34s)]
*  And I'm it's that's why I mean it's like I feel I [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=1844.3s)]
*  Approach it with a great deal. I think the right word is reverence because it's it's not sad [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=1848.86s)]
*  But it is it is like a very [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=1853.98s)]
*  Important meaningful and tender thing to do [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=1856.8999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, 100% man. Yeah, I feel sometimes like I'm trying to make rope out of like the tattered [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=1860.46s)]
*  the very frayed [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=1868.1s)]
*  pieces of like of [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=1870.8999999999999s)]
*  My youth kind of right as I get older, you know [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=1873.46s)]
*  And not very frayed. I don't want to I'm not trying to have any self-pity or something [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=1878.1799999999998s)]
*  But I feel like I'm trying to be a little bit more of a little bit more of a little bit more of a little bit more [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=1881.3799999999999s)]
*  That that's what you try to as you as you get older [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=1886.82s)]
*  You're just still trying to make this rope or make a knot out of this make different knots out of rope [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=1889.22s)]
*  That was kind of like ram shackle II kind of tied [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=1895.22s)]
*  Yeah to the beginning of the foundation at certain points. Yeah, the underpinnings of of wellness start early. Yeah, and and usually [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=1898.8999999999999s)]
*  Attachment feeling, you know attachment injuries is no joke. So [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=1908.78s)]
*  Most children and what I mean most say 99.9 99 percent of kids are loved by their parents [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=1914.46s)]
*  Okay, but what happens is parents? [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=1920.54s)]
*  Can show this much love and [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=1925.14s)]
*  The child actually needs more love than than they get and it's not that there's a malicious thing [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=1929.26s)]
*  It's just there's a mismatch right and that that mismatch creates this like this emptiness [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=1935.42s)]
*  the start of loss or grief or or or not being cared for and [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=1940.8999999999999s)]
*  Depending on how it gets nudged in life. It starts showing up as you know, how they choose, you know relationships [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=1946.82s)]
*  how they try to navigate life and and if it's really bad and they start having other things pop up and and they get on medicine and [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=1953.6999999999998s)]
*  It works or it doesn't you know medicines do work. So let's let's not say they don't work [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=1961.6999999999998s)]

*  But that I was wasting the experience and I may not have been it could just be me being judgmental but [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=2185.7599999999998s)]
*  because I think it was helpful, but there were times where I felt like [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=2191.7599999999998s)]
*  Like I was just kind of swimming through some of the same waters without really [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=2194.8399999999997s)]
*  Knowing what we were looking for trying to do that. That's sort of the but that may be okay [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=2198.72s)]
*  Maybe that's just what you do sometimes with it. Well, and that's why you know, this is an on ongoing [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=2204.14s)]
*  evolution and care because [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=2210.7999999999997s)]
*  Ketamine-assisted psychotherapy really hasn't existed very long because you're right people were like [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=2212.8s)]
*  Okay, what are we doing with it? And then as we started to you know? [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=2219.2200000000003s)]
*  Explore what we could do with it. We realized that hey, we can do a lot more than we thought when did it start? [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=2223.48s)]
*  Ketamine-assisted psychotherapy. Yeah, even just ketamine assist like when did ketamine start? [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=2229.76s)]
*  I mean everybody's always calls it a horse-trank all the time, you know, well ketamine was originally I think it was invented in what? [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=2234.02s)]
*  50s or 60s and [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=2240.88s)]
*  It is it's an anesthesia medicine. So horse tranquilizer anesthesia [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=2243.0s)]
*  It's it isn't it's a dissociative anesthetic by definition. Okay, okay [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=2246.88s)]
*  So you use it to put help put people to sleep for operations or procedures and is it found in nature or no? [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=2251.42s)]
*  It's not no, it's me [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=2257.74s)]
*  No, not that we know of it could be out there. Do you think it could be or no probably not? [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=2259.36s)]
*  but yeah, there are other things that are sort of like [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=2264.4s)]
*  Synthesizing 62 a book professor [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=2267.16s)]
*  Animals which provided promising results it was used for testing on human prisoners in 64. There you go [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=2269.8799999999997s)]
*  I didn't know that [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=2275.8399999999997s)]
*  Proofs act faster and reduce toxic behavior, which made it the preferable anesthetic choice over PCP. Damn [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=2277.8399999999997s)]
*  It's interesting. It's amazing. How many drugs used to be just available like I remember I was working on I [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=2284.68s)]
*  Was working in Mississippi on a farm for a while and the man said that they used to buy [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=2291.84s)]
*  Ecstasy at the bar. They had it like in a jar on the bar and you could go buy it [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=2296.96s)]
*  You could buy a tab of ecstasy like before it was I guess illegalized, you know [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=2301.48s)]
*  Well, there was a brief time where it was a legal drug you could buy they you know [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=2305.92s)]
*  Prior to like I think it was 1970 [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=2311.1600000000003s)]
*  The LSD and all that psychedelic research was was actually [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=2313.48s)]
*  Going really strong and what happened was I think the government finally said enough because it started beginning [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=2317.6s)]
*  It was recreating too much. That was when you had sort of like the hippies and LSD and all that stuff [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=2325.56s)]
*  And oh, yeah, and so when they shut it down [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=2330.16s)]
*  They they they shut down all the research, too [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=2332.68s)]
*  so it clobbered the the ability to [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=2336.04s)]
*  investigate all these kind of interesting substances [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=2341.72s)]
*  For real clinical aid, you know use [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=2343.96s)]
*  Roll the ball forward, you know 20 30 years and now now you actually have like [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=2347.16s)]
*  The government is is very interested in in some of these therapies and the real reason is [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=2352.56s)]
*  the state of veteran health [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=2360.6800000000003s)]
*  You know there you have so many veterans that are [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=2364.08s)]
*  Struggling. Yeah, and you know, I think it's a very interesting thing [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=2367.88s)]
*  Yeah, and you know, they have these these organizations that are trying to reach out to veterans but the suicide rate among veterans is [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=2370.92s)]
*  Just really horrible Wow, I don't even know that yeah, I saw a metric a while ago. It was like more [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=2379.76s)]
*  combat veterans from Afghanistan have killed themselves than have died in [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=2387.6000000000004s)]
*  the line of fire [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=2392.96s)]
*  So so you think about the they're that distressed? [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=2394.44s)]
*  And then they come back here and they just you know, go back to work and it doesn't work that way [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=2398.8s)]
*  Yeah, and so the you know, the government's funding research on this stuff because [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=2404.0800000000004s)]
*  They got to figure out how to help people. It's yeah, it'll help save them money too. If they can [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=2410.48s)]
*  It is to put it right there, but also yes, it is but it's actually providing the the gas for helping [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=2415.04s)]
*  actual therapies that work as opposed to just [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=2420.84s)]
*  Yeah, so that's you know, I'll take it, you know if we can help get serious about it, yeah for sure [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=2423.64s)]
*  and so [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=2429.3199999999997s)]
*  So those are types of people so [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=2430.88s)]
*  Can people really use this therapy to get off of antidepressants? And how does that work? [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=2433.2s)]
*  Short answer is don't know [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=2439.24s)]
*  What what I have seen [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=2442.2799999999997s)]
*  and [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=2444.96s)]
*  And like I said, this is sort of on the fly [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=2446.0s)]
*  Like I said, it's a very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=2448.12s)]
*  this is this whole body of knowledge is growing a lot is is [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=2454.08s)]
*  people who have [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=2459.3199999999997s)]
*  Profound distressors in their life that are under addressed are gonna have probably pressure to have symptoms [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=2462.96s)]
*  So they're gonna be in depressed states and if you can help people [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=2470.24s)]
*  Through something like ketamine as a system psychotherapy resolve [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=2474.2s)]
*  Those long-standing pains of emotion in them [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=2478.0s)]
*  Then it stands to reason that the odds of them finding a way forward are [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=2482.2799999999997s)]
*  better [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=2488.92s)]
*  That makes sense. Yeah, it's sort of a wishy-washy statement, but it's it's the same thing [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=2490.6s)]
*  It's like like, you know at my place we sort of break down why people are depressed [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=2495.92s)]
*  And it's and you sort of break them into these categories where you have your your your groups. It's more like [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=2500.2799999999997s)]
*  Serotonin and then you have your dopamine people. So I actually asked my patients. I'm like what gets you high? [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=2507.54s)]
*  I'm like, what's booze do for you or what's cocaine do for you and [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=2513.2200000000003s)]
*  And or shopping or gambling or because you're trying to stratify them like what what what's goosing them? [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=2518.94s)]
*  Right, right, right. So that helps you pick like your therapy [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=2525.98s)]
*  Because if you got a guy who can't stand cocaine or stimulants like that, then it's probably [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=2530.06s)]
*  He's probably needs more serotonin so right you can sort of shape what you do for them to help them with that and [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=2535.38s)]
*  You can mix it. So it's all becoming like this basket of [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=2541.34s)]
*  ketamine sits alongside [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=2544.9s)]
*  a lot of other tools and if you're using all of them [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=2547.42s)]
*  Together and you're helping this person who comes you unpack [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=2552.7400000000002s)]
*  What they're carrying and you give them better tools in their pack to go on? [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=2557.6200000000003s)]
*  Then the odds of them staying in on the road are better right and that's sort of like how like [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=2562.38s)]
*  integrative psychiatry works now, it's like [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=2569.1800000000003s)]
*  You don't just say hey, here's your prescription get out of my face [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=2572.02s)]
*  You actually sit down you talk to me find out why they're suffering. Yeah, not oh you have depression. It's like, okay [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=2575.98s)]
*  Where what what's your you know [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=2583.82s)]
*  What's wrong? What hurts? [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=2586.58s)]
*  When did it get started right how's it shaped you [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=2588.74s)]
*  Can you talk about it and what level of detail can you talk about it? And that's why I mean, it's it's a very [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=2592.7799999999997s)]
*  like almost a [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=2599.2599999999998s)]
*  it's a very [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=2601.02s)]
*  Intimate conversation [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=2605.66s)]
*  Yeah, you know, that's a great. That's a great word intimate. I feel it felt really intimate, you know [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=2607.38s)]
*  I remember I mean right when I started going around it started tears just like rolled out of my eyes [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=2611.8199999999997s)]
*  You know, like I don't even know what was going on really, you know [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=2616.54s)]
*  No, I think it could have just been like I mean me. I'm always probably 30% sad. So who knows what it was, you know, but [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=2619.58s)]
*  But I remember just being pretty emotional out of the gate and the first day I was dehydrated [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=2627.5s)]
*  Literally just from like crying I think half of the whole session like and some of it [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=2632.1s)]
*  I didn't realize I was crying like I didn't even really feel it because I was kind of also [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=2635.94s)]
*  You get kind of you're kind of anesthetized in a way [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=2639.98s)]
*  So the main part of me that's still awake is kind of this [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=2643.42s)]
*  Kind of that all-knowing place inside of your head where you have ideas and stuff, you know [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=2647.74s)]
*  Yeah, like whenever you're thinking about something you envision something like that place, you know [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=2651.38s)]
*  I have had quite a few patients that and I tell them this I'm like, hey, you know [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=2655.34s)]
*  They a lot of them tend to feel pretty quiet [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=2662.5s)]
*  like they have like all the [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=2664.78s)]
*  the mental movie is sort of taking a break when they're when they're done for their session for the day and they kind of [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=2667.18s)]
*  Yeah, just roll with that don't do any homework just sort of like [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=2672.1s)]
*  Try to you know, I try to keep them on zero and I and I say it is [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=2676.1s)]
*  You know very possible that if you just start burst out into tears later tonight, that's normal [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=2681.7400000000002s)]
*  Yeah, that means like you're you've connected to something and that's like an overdue release and so I [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=2686.2200000000003s)]
*  remember I was talking to this this young lady and she was [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=2694.06s)]
*  She was upset she's like what my crying I can't stop crying [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=2698.1s)]
*  I was like I was like you're gonna hate me for saying this but this is very good [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=2700.5s)]
*  Yeah, because she was just releasing all this thing that she had packed up in her and [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=2704.38s)]
*  And the next day she kind of like, you know, it's like after a good cry you like but she cried [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=2712.14s)]
*  You know big chunk of her life out in a night and yeah [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=2717.86s)]
*  Yeah, that's that's a great way to say it [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=2721.46s)]
*  I think it felt like that like just a lot of stuff that was going on [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=2723.3s)]
*  You kind of got to like take the pressure valve off a little bit in some ways [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=2726.66s)]
*  But yeah, I would like to have another experience with it in the future and be able to [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=2733.66s)]
*  Know going in have more of a game plan going in so that I can but then one of my issues sometimes is controlling things [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=2738.46s)]
*  So it's interesting. So I don't want to go in sometimes to that and try to can manipulate, you know control the situation [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=2746.38s)]
*  You know control the situation, you know, so which might not even be possible under that [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=2752.94s)]
*  It's it kind of depends on your mindset on it, you know, I think [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=2760.26s)]
*  What I try to do is I try to give people a lot of [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=2765.94s)]
*  sort of [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=2769.34s)]
*  Neutralizing information so that they understand exactly what's you know, the more you understand [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=2770.78s)]
*  What's going on and why we're doing this they sort of their their their guard starts to come down because really [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=2775.54s)]
*  If you don't want it to work, it's not going to work [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=2782.86s)]
*  And and so you want them to be like, okay, I understand why this is gonna happen. And [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=2785.5800000000004s)]
*  So one of the best things I like to do actually is is find out what they can do with it [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=2791.6600000000003s)]
*  so I do this thing where I give my patients a it's a it's like a [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=2796.34s)]
*  Butcher paper, it's you know, it comes off a ream [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=2801.6200000000003s)]
*  But it's actually graph paper and I haven't put it up on the wall and we do these five columns and it's your age down [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=2803.98s)]
*  the middle then where you lived [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=2809.42s)]
*  What your relationships were what your activities were and what your substances were and you just sort of write it down from zero to [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=2811.78s)]
*  today and [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=2819.26s)]
*  If they can do that then you can kind of get a they can sort of look at their life [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=2820.7000000000003s)]
*  And if they can't do that that sort of shows me where we need to sort of use ketamine to examine some things that are [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=2825.1800000000003s)]
*  Like sort of like they're no-go zones and I got a number of guys who they can't finish it, huh? [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=2831.94s)]
*  Because it's sort of like you can't finish it and if you can't finish it then you know, I [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=2837.94s)]
*  You know, I don't know how we're gonna finish it in this [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=2843.5s)]
*  Context without they're being emotionally brutal on you. Right and that's what the ketamine allows is it takes the edge off [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=2847.9s)]
*  Looking at things that you can't look at. Oh, wow [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=2855.1s)]
*  Yeah, it was interesting. Like I wonder if there were things where maybe my my being or whatever was just afraid to [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=2858.1s)]
*  To [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=2863.78s)]
*  Unwind them right or just couldn't you know or couldn't find like the key the way into them [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=2865.94s)]
*  Sometimes it's so it's such a small opening into getting into like an old feeling an old way [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=2872.0600000000004s)]
*  I see that pop up all the time. Yeah, it's pretty fascinating [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=2878.2200000000003s)]
*  We got a question that came in right here from a young gentleman right here. This seemed like a decent guy right here [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=2880.86s)]
*  What up I got a question for dr. Poehler and for Theo so I wanted to start off dr. [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=2886.5s)]
*  Poehler what is the negative connotations with the ketamine therapy and then what would be your argument against that? [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=2892.1s)]
*  Theo what was your favorite thing about ketamine therapy versus regular therapy gang gang gang? [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=2899.22s)]
*  That's good question. What you got doctor? [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=2905.2999999999997s)]
*  so the the negative connotations, I think the [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=2907.66s)]
*  societal thing is [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=2912.62s)]
*  there's [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=2914.7s)]
*  sort of a societal sort of frown against like psychedelics in general and [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=2916.3399999999997s)]
*  You know, it got started back probably with like the hippies and LSD. And so you kind of get this blanket [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=2922.1s)]
*  Oh, this is that psychedelic hippie trippy stuff and and so it can marginalize its actual utility [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=2928.18s)]
*  Right as a real medical therapy and there's an organization [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=2935.54s)]
*  Called maps that that is dedicated to doing high quality research [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=2939.66s)]
*  to counterbalance that notion that this is like, you know step into my van type stuff and yeah and [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=2944.58s)]
*  And to make it legitimate and the proper studies and the proper funding from you know [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=2950.94s)]
*  Like the DOD and things like that because they want it to be as legitimate as possible [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=2956.98s)]
*  Yeah, it's interesting almost you really have to mod like there has to be a group kind of monitoring that branding and how that really? [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=2963.7400000000002s)]
*  How it hits the public and stuff. It's a little wild Westie right now. They've even said it in some of the publications because [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=2969.98s)]
*  The you know all the ketamine right now [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=2977.3s)]
*  It's it's technically off-label the way they're the way everybody's using it not a lot of medicines get used off-label all the time [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=2979.42s)]
*  so [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=2986.98s)]
*  Is that a problem? No, but but it it [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=2988.3s)]
*  needs to be [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=2992.1800000000003s)]
*  looked at down the road because [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=2994.02s)]
*  You know, it's like those silent life skits in the 80s where you know, you go to your doctor and you get a hey doc [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=2996.54s)]
*  I got a I got a I got a you know [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=3001.7000000000003s)]
*  Pinky hurts you go. Here's a prescription for some weed, you know [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=3005.1s)]
*  Remember those skits that that were like that and it's like you got it. You got to be careful [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=3008.22s)]
*  you don't have the slippery slope because I get I get [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=3012.1s)]
*  Mailings from places they want to ship me. I'm like ketamine lozenges and stuff and you know, that's that's not gonna [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=3015.7s)]
*  It's not gonna go well [[00:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=3023.2599999999998s)]
*  Yeah, I don't I I had six [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=3025.2599999999998s)]
*  Infusions like you're talking about like you like you mentioned is probably that [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=3029.22s)]
*  Probably protocol not protocol, but it's the best. No, it's the best. That's the research. That's the research [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=3033.1s)]
*  That is what they fared it out in the research was the most legitimate and best way to proceed [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=3040.1s)]
*  Is is what you did and after for I felt good after four the last two I felt a little [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=3046.1s)]
*  It got a little griswoldy, you know, I felt like I was on a [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=3053.2599999999998s)]
*  You know, it felt like I was just on a kind of a gnarly vacation [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=3057.1s)]
*  You know is like I don't really know if I needed the last two or or maybe I did I don't know [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=3060.6s)]
*  I just I think at that point I started to think what I wish I had a better [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=3065.48s)]
*  Game plan going into this so I could use it to the best of my ability [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=3070.36s)]
*  I didn't know if I was using it to the best of my ability the therapist was saying [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=3073.96s)]
*  And it was a great it was a great place and everything but he was saying that it worked it'll work kind of no matter what [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=3078.16s)]
*  There is is there some truth to that that it'll work no matter what? Yes, so we know it works. Okay [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=3084.24s)]
*  The question is is how long does it work? Right and and what the sort of like the industry? [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=3090.64s)]
*  the professional side of this injury industry is trying to do is make this a a [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=3097.16s)]
*  very serious [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=3103.7999999999997s)]
*  one-time attempt [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=3106.04s)]
*  To get as much utility out of it [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=3107.96s)]
*  So that that the effect is very durable and that's why you got to do all the side work with it [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=3111.48s)]
*  And that's why you want really really good [[00:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=3117.24s)]
*  Assisted psychotherapy because you can sort of unwind things that are still sort of in the background [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=3121.3199999999997s)]
*  If you're if you're sort of poking around and and the more things you can resolve the more your heart can be at rest [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=3126.6s)]
*  The odds of you needing more of it are less and that's very desirable. So, you know like at my place [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=3134.52s)]
*  I've only had one patient [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=3144.72s)]
*  ever [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=3147.2799999999997s)]
*  Need a booster. Hmm, and he was a he's a veteran and his there's some you know [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=3148.4799999999996s)]
*  There's some confounders with that but but most people are are and I don't let them go either [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=3154.56s)]
*  I don't like when they come to me [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=3160.16s)]
*  I take them on and and we get to know them on the front end and we're following them on the back end and I'm taking [[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=3161.7599999999998s)]
*  care of all their other [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=3167.9599999999996s)]
*  Sort of issues. I don't I don't like send them to places to [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=3169.8399999999997s)]
*  You know you you come to me and I work with you and the idea is that [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=3173.52s)]
*  We're here to get you into a better place of durable. Well-being. We're not here to give you ketamine, right? [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=3177.12s)]
*  It's not you're not like a sawmill. You're doing actual boarding kind of you're actually bringing them on [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=3183.6s)]
*  What is the number one thing that a lot of [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=3189.68s)]
*  veterans struggle with or [[00:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=3193.2799999999997s)]
*  What is what is the so some of that trauma you always hear about the this? [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=3195.4s)]
*  There's two things actually that it's actually interesting the way this is starting to pop up [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=3199.48s)]
*  So PTSD and actually concussions so traumatic brain injuries if you take a somebody who has been [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=3204.56s)]
*  in combat and has had [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=3213.0s)]
*  Ordinance exploding around them and they've been taking those shockwaves to their head even though they look fine [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=3215.3599999999997s)]
*  It's hasn't a pretty serious depressive effect, right? [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=3220.3599999999997s)]
*  And it's it I talked to a guy out in Colorado last week about this [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=3224.8599999999997s)]
*  They're they're trying to find ways to heal these guys [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=3229.8599999999997s)]
*  because they tend to be like very [[00:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=3232.3799999999997s)]
*  sensitive to [[00:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=3235.3399999999997s)]
*  emotional dysregulation because you think about you take a fish bowl and [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=3236.74s)]
*  You put you cook up like 30 30 bags of ramen. Okay, and you put it in a fish bowl [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=3241.4599999999996s)]
*  It's a big of all like like a goldfish bowl. So it's like completely full of noodles [[00:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=3246.4599999999996s)]
*  Okay, so that's your brain and then you hit it with a bat the noodles are gonna move [[00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=3251.1800000000003s)]
*  So if you're taking concussions repeatedly, it's gonna scramble your noodle [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=3255.7400000000002s)]
*  Yeah [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=3260.38s)]
*  and so those are nerve connections that that are responsible for your daily function and as those get ripped apart and [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=3260.82s)]
*  Try to heal they don't necessarily get it right all the time. So [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=3266.86s)]
*  like people are [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=3270.34s)]
*  There they're they're hurt in a way that's hard [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=3272.42s)]
*  to address interesting [[00:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=3276.1400000000003s)]
*  Yeah, because it doesn't seem like we're meant to be batted around that much, you know, no not at all [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=3278.8599999999997s)]
*  So those are some of the most common things you see as far as veterans is like [[00:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=3284.62s)]
*  Stuff from concussion stuff. That's that's one. Okay. The other one is frankly the [[00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=3289.66s)]
*  Grossness of war. I mean, yeah, you see two of your buddies incinerated in front of you and that gets on a record [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=3296.3799999999997s)]
*  That won't come out of your head and and that's all they can see [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=3302.1s)]
*  So then they get like super [[00:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=3306.18s)]
*  super sensitized so [[00:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=3309.18s)]
*  So they're stuck in this place in their mind where they're still driving down that road when that car bomb went off [[00:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=3311.7400000000002s)]
*  And so when they hear a door slam or something that that's a neural circuit that got burned in in the strongest of ways [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=3317.66s)]
*  So they have this they have this nerve pathway that that's just seared into you [[00:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=3324.84s)]
*  And so it's on alert because it's still there and so your neighbor boom closes the door you're like [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=3329.2599999999998s)]
*  And or you hit the deck or you do those kind of things and so that's one of the things that you know, they're proposing [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=3336.98s)]
*  That they use ketamine to work with no patients on [[00:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=3344.9399999999996s)]
*  Why does trauma create such strong like neuro pathways or like connection? Does that make sense? [[00:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=3348.74s)]
*  the and does it it sounds like it must right it does because [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=3354.66s)]
*  So it's it's post-traumatic stress [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=3360.22s)]
*  What what happens is when something happens to you? [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=3364.98s)]
*  You form a temporary memory. Okay, like what'd you eat for dinner last night? You could probably tell me what it is [[00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=3369.14s)]
*  Salad, but but two years from now two years ago. What'd you eat for dinner? I have no idea. Yeah, I don't know so [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=3377.1s)]
*  intense experiences make different signals [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=3384.02s)]
*  Like right, but I could tell you falls on like a boat accident correct now ramp that up [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=3387.42s)]
*  to about 11 and [[00:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=3393.86s)]
*  And we're Andrea Galen. Yeah, then it gets pretty deep and then then you can't forget about it because it's it's it's sort of your [[00:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=3397.02s)]
*  Neurochemistry has decided that this needs to be a permanent reminder probably from a more for safety [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=3404.1400000000003s)]
*  probably yeah more of a like fight flight or flee type thing and [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=3410.46s)]
*  So given where we are in the world today, so it's inflammation kind of then [[00:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=3414.58s)]
*  yeah, so those are yeah, because [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=3419.82s)]
*  That's the craziest thing about it is is [[00:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=3422.94s)]
*  The way the immune system works with your mind is is [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=3426.42s)]
*  phenomenal like [[00:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=3432.14s)]
*  You can even measure it now like you know how when you get the flu you you feel crummy [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=3434.34s)]
*  You don't want to get off the couch [[00:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=3439.54s)]
*  Food doesn't taste good sex isn't interesting all that stuff goes away, right? [[00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=3441.06s)]
*  Imagine being like that walking around living life like that. Mm-hmm that happens because your immune system knocks out your dopamine system [[00:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=3447.36s)]
*  So you don't have access to your dopamine system because you're sick because of your immune system [[00:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=3454.92s)]
*  Because you're supposed to be healing under a tree [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=3461.14s)]
*  but if you're walking around and [[00:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=3463.7s)]
*  You have your immune system activated you begin to look like somebody [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=3466.5s)]
*  Who doesn't have access to the feel-good? [[00:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=3471.06s)]
*  Wait explain that to me again. Sorry. I got lost so so [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=3474.02s)]
*  Your immune system. Mm-hmm when you're sick takes your your dopamine system offline [[00:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=3478.18s)]
*  Oh, that's just what it does. That's what it does that on purpose so you can heal [[00:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=3484.06s)]
*  Oh because they don't want you trying to feel good because you're not gonna heal correct, right? [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=3487.7s)]
*  Got it. But if you're walking around [[00:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=3491.7s)]
*  If you're walking around day in and day out year and you're out and your immune system is slightly activated [[00:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=3494.02s)]
*  And your dopamine system is always offline then life is flat and feeling good is [[00:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=3501.06s)]
*  Inaccessible to you and are you depressed or you just not have access to your dopamine system? Wow, that's interesting [[00:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=3508.2599999999998s)]
*  Yeah, that's a great question and you can check that with it's actually pretty straightforward to check now now [[00:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=3514.86s)]
*  You got to get a simple lab drawn to see if your immune system is activated and that helps point therapy [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=3520.34s)]
*  So like what I do is when people come to me is I I check some labs on them [[00:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=3527.04s)]
*  I get to know them a little bit in in ways that I do my thing [[00:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=3531.52s)]
*  And so I kind of want to know where they're at. Amen [[00:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=3535.2s)]
*  So we can start shaping what comes next and that's before we take them in the room because I look at it as I want [[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=3538.32s)]
*  I want this to be as useful as possible, right and then so that when we get to the other side of it [[00:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=3544.7999999999997s)]
*  We still are learning things, but like I had a patient who he was done [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=3550.5s)]
*  Okay, but something else popped up in his mind because he was having this problem where on a regular basis [[00:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=3555.68s)]
*  He would have panic attacks at a certain time of day. Mm-hmm. Okay, like clockwork and I talked to him. I was like [[00:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=3561.72s)]
*  What time of day did your dad get home when you were a kid and he just stopped [[00:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=3569.96s)]
*  Same time of day all his life Wow [[00:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=3576.12s)]
*  That's crazy, but he was able to see it then because before he couldn't even see it [[00:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=3579.2799999999997s)]
*  But now we could talk about it and resolve it and so he was able to see it when he was under this the therapy [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=3583.68s)]
*  After afterwards, so we were done this popped up even later [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=3588.68s)]
*  Because he was saying, you know, I'm doing pretty good, but I still have this one thing that's popping up on me [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=3592.2799999999997s)]
*  And I said, well, what is it? We talked about it and I asked him and he's like [[00:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=3595.7599999999998s)]
*  Yeah [[00:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=3599.96s)]
*  Yeah [[01:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=3601.48s)]
*  What um, what could you give a question that came up Sean? Sorry, let's get to that. Oh [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=3603.56s)]
*  Actually, this is a comedian friend of mine Shane Moss [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=3607.96s)]
*  who [[01:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=3611.44s)]
*  He is a psychonaut. So he's like a man [[01:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=3613.08s)]
*  Who he's very funny man, and he also is a man who has [[01:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=3617.16s)]
*  Experimented with different psychedelics and stuff over the years to have experiences just like an astronaut would with like outer space, right? [[01:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=3621.42s)]
*  He's kind of done him with like inner space. So [[01:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=3628.56s)]
*  Awesome to have this from him. Oh [[01:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=3631.52s)]
*  Shane Moss here in case you can't recognize me. I hear you're getting ketamine treatment. I think that's [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=3634.7599999999998s)]
*  Fantastic very very worth exploring see if it suits you [[01:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=3641.7400000000002s)]
*  psychedelics are [[01:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=3647.02s)]
*  Not always the most linear [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=3648.42s)]
*  thing in the world compared to other [[01:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=3651.0600000000004s)]
*  Medications or drugs or what-have-you but mental health isn't a linear thing either. And so I wish you the best of luck [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=3653.86s)]
*  I hope it [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=3660.0600000000004s)]
*  shows some improvements [[01:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=3661.6600000000003s)]
*  and my question for your guest is [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=3664.26s)]
*  I'm wondering if you could talk a little bit about [[01:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=3667.38s)]
*  experiential versus chemical change rather than [[01:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=3670.5s)]
*  Taking say antidepressant every day and and altering your chemical imbalance or whatever a psychedelic journey is a lot more about [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=3674.1s)]
*  using that temporary [[01:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=3683.58s)]
*  chemical [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=3686.38s)]
*  chemically induced change to have more kind of personal breakthroughs and insights and [[01:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=3687.6200000000003s)]
*  Those insights are kind of what leads to the personal growth [[01:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=3693.9s)]
*  More than some permanent chemical [[01:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=3699.38s)]
*  Change that you're doing or a long-term change that you're doing to your mind. Oh, yeah [[01:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=3703.1s)]
*  Yeah, thanks brother [[01:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=3709.02s)]
*  So this is like a two-headed [[01:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=3711.46s)]
*  animal here because you have like the [[01:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=3715.42s)]
*  The neurochemistry of what happens? [[01:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=3718.38s)]
*  Okay, and then from there you have what you experienced as a result of the neurochemistry and and he's he's [[01:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=3720.62s)]
*  hit the nail on the head with that is is [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=3728.1s)]
*  Therapy like this allows you to have so you're getting therapy or you're getting mood elevation from either therapists or from [[01:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=3732.66s)]
*  Like a medication you're on regularly. Yeah. Well you have this thing where it's a call it [[01:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=3739.8599999999997s)]
*  A rapid gain so you're cruising along you also and you have something that goes way up [[01:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=3746.46s)]
*  You're like, oh man, I figured that out and and it goes like that, but it doesn't work like that [[01:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=3751.18s)]
*  You actually have to go for a long time you don't have those very often with therapy. Okay, right [[01:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=3755.14s)]
*  so what what ketamine does and [[01:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=3759.86s)]
*  Psychedelic is it's like a lot of access to rapid insight for a prolonged period of time [[01:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=3763.2999999999997s)]
*  relative to say going to therapy for five years, right and [[01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=3770.18s)]
*  It could be a couple hour a couple minute actual portal. Is that what you mean kind of like that? [[01:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=3775.54s)]
*  Well, that's where you talk about what happens is we know that ketamine [[01:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=3779.46s)]
*  Helps nerves grow [[01:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=3784.6s)]
*  so if you have nerves that are firing in a way that is causing you to have a depressed mood state or [[01:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=3787.44s)]
*  anxiety and [[01:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=3795.7599999999998s)]
*  you [[01:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=3797.6s)]
*  basically [[01:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=3798.96s)]
*  soak those in ketamine for a [[01:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=3799.96s)]
*  Say a period of a couple weeks with six infusions [[01:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=3802.44s)]
*  you can [[01:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=3806.24s)]
*  Get some plasticity and how those nerves work so you can change how those nerves are connected they grow a little bit [[01:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=3809.24s)]
*  They actually like they've seen it on the under microscopes [[01:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=3816.52s)]
*  These nerves actually grow little sprouts and they they can change and so you're enhancing your ability to change [[01:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=3819.12s)]
*  at a like a microscopic level amen and that translates into like a [[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=3824.9599999999996s)]
*  Change in perspective on things. Yeah sort of metaphysically [[01:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=3832.04s)]
*  I mean, this is kind of like we're going into the into the the realm between [[01:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=3836.0s)]
*  Electron microscopy and spirituality, you know, I mean but but it it is so so if you look at it [[01:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=3842.84s)]
*  How person experiences it is that they can see? [[01:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=3849.48s)]
*  What they've experienced? [[01:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=3852.72s)]
*  They can find things that they've experienced and connect to themselves more fully [[01:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=3855.36s)]
*  And if they can be a more full person and have less pain carried in [[01:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=3860.2s)]
*  Them because they were able to have an emotional release by connecting to a loss from the past [[01:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=3866.84s)]
*  And they're probably gonna walk away from it feeling better about [[01:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=3873.56s)]
*  life globally. Mm-hmm [[01:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=3877.56s)]
*  Yeah, you know, I think that's a good summation a little bit of just what I felt I felt like [[01:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=3880.48s)]
*  There were new ways to connect [[01:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=3886.52s)]
*  Yeah [[01:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=3890.08s)]
*  Kind of and I couldn't describe it exactly and I couldn't manage it [[01:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=3891.2799999999997s)]
*  But I felt like [[01:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=3898.88s)]
*  It was [[01:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=3901.72s)]
*  Helpful I felt like when that when I knew more tricks and how to almost use the controller better [[01:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=3903.84s)]
*  I would go back and play the game again [[01:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=3908.3199999999997s)]
*  If that makes any sense does [[01:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=3911.4s)]
*  So what's so what's uh [[01:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=3914.4s)]
*  Shane is saying is that so you're saying that so ketamine is more of like an experiential type of thing. It's both [[01:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=3916.56s)]
*  So to to the person who's experiencing it, they're they're gaining [[01:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=3923.8s)]
*  sort of a [[01:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=3929.76s)]
*  They're [[01:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=3933.08s)]
*  gaining like this [[01:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=3934.76s)]
*  Alternate or this this additional view of things they're they're gaining insight [[01:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=3936.7200000000003s)]
*  They're up here and they can look around themselves more like like that not like they're not in the game [[01:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=3942.0s)]
*  sort of like they're looking at the game and [[01:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=3948.24s)]
*  From that they can be like, you know that really that doesn't hurt as much as I thought [[01:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=3951.96s)]
*  And they can see like oh I can see that. Yeah, I never really got over that. That's been sort of haunting me [[01:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=3955.92s)]
*  like okay, I'm okay and and [[01:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=3961.7599999999998s)]
*  so [[01:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=3965.52s)]
*  That's what it can provide now the nice nudge is when you can have somebody like say well, you remember you'd mentioned this and [[01:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=3966.92s)]
*  Let's let's explore this a little bit and see how those decisions [[01:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=3974.08s)]
*  sort of were pushed by emotional distress or pain and [[01:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=3978.8s)]
*  Rolled the ball through this event and then you kind of see you try and sequence it through [[01:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=3983.56s)]
*  Through life so you don't want to miss things, right? It's the gaps the gaps are the key [[01:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=3989.32s)]
*  Yeah, I could see that yeah, I wish I yeah in hindsight [[01:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=3995.0s)]
*  I would go with like a timeline kind of a little bit of like yeah plan [[01:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=3998.44s)]
*  I like I like doing the school thing like yeah, I agree. You know that the one question [[01:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=4001.2s)]
*  I like to ask people is [[01:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=4005.88s)]
*  When was the last time you felt whole? [[01:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=4008.04s)]
*  Jesus and then what was it that began to separate you from that feeling? [[01:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=4011.52s)]
*  Yeah, I don't even know man. I probably was a damn in a zygote [[01:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=4018.44s)]
*  Yeah, and then and then you go back to if they can't if they can't dial it back that far you go back to like [[01:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=4023.3599999999997s)]
*  Whenever like five four three [[01:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=4028.3999999999996s)]
*  When did they feel love to one blast off is when I probably felt it. Maybe I don't even know. Yeah, I don't know [[01:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=4030.7999999999997s)]
*  I don't I mean, I know you're not asking me but it's just yeah [[01:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=4036.52s)]
*  It's interesting for people to think that the place I was at the therapist hadn't done the experience [[01:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=4039.4799999999996s)]
*  Does that matter if they've done it or not? [[01:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=4044.66s)]
*  Hmm I [[01:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=4048.04s)]
*  I don't know [[01:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=4050.9599999999996s)]
*  Maybe it doesn't it's kind of one of the things it depends on on where the therapist is [[01:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=4053.24s)]
*  What um? [[01:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=4058.3599999999997s)]
*  What made you care about this? How'd you get into this whole universe? [[01:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=4060.16s)]
*  you know, I did anesthesia for quite some time and I [[01:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=4063.9599999999996s)]
*  And you were a real doctor then yeah. Yeah. I have an MD [[01:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=4067.8799999999997s)]
*  and [[01:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=4072.4799999999996s)]
*  I saw ketamine work pretty well and because I was I did anesthesia, right? [[01:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=4076.8799999999997s)]
*  Was it fun being anesthesia it was interesting it was fun and it was crazy and it was but it was a you know [[01:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=4081.7799999999997s)]
*  I mean you listen to music and stuff where you go in there nothing like that [[01:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=4088.7s)]
*  I you know [[01:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=4092.02s)]
*  We had a actually we had a surgeon who who would get noise complaints from the other ORs [[01:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=4092.34s)]
*  Because he would listen to death metal all day and he would turn it up all the way and so he sort of had like a [[01:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=4097.62s)]
*  His own little crew because you kind of have to be like the right [[01:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=4103.0599999999995s)]
*  Be in the right mindscape to go in there and listen to mega death for 12 hours. Yeah at you know [[01:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=4106.719999999999s)]
*  80 DB all day long [[01:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=4113.599999999999s)]
*  Yeah, that's crazy. You're cracking up in a rib cage and you're hot all hopped up [[01:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=4115.88s)]
*  Well, the surgeons next door in the rooms next door with him, you know, it's like been in a hotel [[01:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=4119.36s)]
*  They'd be like dude tell him to knock it off [[01:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=4123.32s)]
*  But it was I mean it was it was it was crazy [[01:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=4125.44s)]
*  I mean it was it was good, but it was it was like super busy super high-intensity. Yeah [[01:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=4128.92s)]
*  And you have to stay the whole time you just hit him with that dose and you roll out it depends [[01:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=4135.9s)]
*  Okay, but the way our model was we had [[01:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=4140.74s)]
*  Nurse anesthetist and and so we would we worked together with them and they would stay the whole time and I would I would come [[01:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=4144.299999999999s)]
*  In and troubleshoot things and get the get the ball rolling and and you know [[01:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=4150.5s)]
*  We were at a place where we took care of really sick people. So it was [[01:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=4154.82s)]
*  You know [[01:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=4159.379999999999s)]
*  It was but you sort of acclimate to it and then you look around and you look at what you acclimated to [[01:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=4159.98s)]
*  and [[01:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=4164.98s)]
*  but but for me what what got me turned into the corner of this is is a [[01:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=4166.259999999999s)]
*  Sort of my understanding of suffering has evolved a lot and [[01:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=4173.42s)]
*  I [[01:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=4178.82s)]
*  Had a brother and he died last year he was injured as a child [[01:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=4181.5s)]
*  terribly [[01:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=4189.0599999999995s)]
*  And he never [[01:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=4191.0599999999995s)]
*  Could get the help he needed and so he [[01:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=4193.22s)]
*  He [[01:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=4197.22s)]
*  Did a lot of drugs he tried to take his own life several times man [[01:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=4198.22s)]
*  Sorry to hear that he did all these things and and I was sitting there and [[01:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=4203.06s)]
*  And he knew he was dying he was in hospice, but I was you know looking at what was coming down the pipeline [[01:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=4208.900000000001s)]
*  I was like, you know if if we can [[01:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=4214.860000000001s)]
*  Help people who've been traumatized [[01:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=4218.26s)]
*  Like it's sort of like for me it's like if this would have been around 20 years ago, maybe I'd still have a brother [[01:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=4220.34s)]
*  Ah [[01:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=4224.900000000001s)]
*  Because he he was sexually abused as a kid and I never tell anybody [[01:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=4226.900000000001s)]
*  Nobody only reason we found out about it is because our [[01:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=4231.42s)]
*  Our pastor was imprisoned [[01:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=4236.42s)]
*  After the fact by somebody else dang and so I couldn't figure out what was wrong with him his whole life [[01:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=4239.3s)]
*  And I asked him one night and he goes yep, and I was like [[01:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=4244.900000000001s)]
*  And but [[01:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=4247.54s)]
*  The damage was just like [[01:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=4249.54s)]
*  Yeah, how much I shaped somebody that's young that's man. That's heartbreaking. I'm sorry. Yeah, so so and I'm sorry for him [[01:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=4252.26s)]
*  I'm sorry that you know, it's heartbreaking to see you know [[01:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=4259.0199999999995s)]
*  I've been you know a lot of my family and being in recovery and struggling through those [[01:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=4261.34s)]
*  You know struggling through trauma and stuff like that childhood trauma not like that [[01:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=4265.98s)]
*  but [[01:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=4269.7s)]
*  Different types of trauma stuff has been pretty prevalent in my family and it's heartbreaking to see that [[01:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=4270.78s)]
*  It's heartbreaking to see the effect that it has on people, you know [[01:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=4275.86s)]
*  It was you know the last six months of his life [[01:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=4278.42s)]
*  I finally got him to say because he was like he was a he was a crusty guy was he yeah [[01:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=4281.7s)]
*  Yeah, and the last were you guys pretty close? Yeah. Oh, that's cool. And he knew he was he knew he was dying [[01:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=4287.179999999999s)]
*  He was drinking himself to death. Yeah, he did and he had the operations and and [[01:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=4292.82s)]
*  He kind of stopped actually, but the problem was is the damage was done and and but like [[01:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=4297.66s)]
*  You know one of the last times we we spoke [[01:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=4304.0599999999995s)]
*  I was sitting with him in the hospital. He was on hospice and and [[01:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=4307.74s)]
*  For the last six months of his life [[01:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=4312.0599999999995s)]
*  I got him to tell me that I told him I loved him every day and he was like [[01:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=4313.58s)]
*  I love you too and like just for him to be able to express emotion was priceless [[01:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=4317.42s)]
*  Yeah, and then you know one of the last moments we spoke I said I love you and he said I love you [[01:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=4321.74s)]
*  I love you, too [[01:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=4326.46s)]
*  And then he goes and he flips me the bird and I was like that's that's Mike and and [[01:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=4327.0199999999995s)]
*  So it was like, you know, I he knew at least he was loved. Yeah, and and that was in [[01:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=4331.82s)]
*  It's important. Yeah, I think a lot of people's life if they struggle with trauma [[01:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=4339.42s)]
*  I think some of it is just yeah thinking that people don't care people that think it unable to feel love [[01:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=4343.34s)]
*  It's weird how a traumatic event can block off other things, you know, yeah [[01:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=4348.299999999999s)]
*  He couldn't he he didn't have the capacity and he never [[01:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=4352.86s)]
*  So he he was still alive [[01:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=4357.98s)]
*  So he he was stuck [[01:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=4360.379999999999s)]
*  And he could never get out of it and you kind of wonder or hope that if somebody else comes to me [[01:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=4362.86s)]
*  And who's a little younger and hasn't burned themselves? [[01:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=4368.62s)]
*  Physically like like damaged themselves enough that you can help them turn the corner. Yeah and get [[01:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=4373.179999999999s)]
*  Healing going in a way that they they can get back on the road of life and and that's sort of [[01:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=4379.74s)]
*  That's to me is a very [[01:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=4385.259999999999s)]
*  Rewarding way to interacting with life, you know, I can look over my shoulder and be like [[01:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=4388.14s)]
*  I [[01:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=4392.780000000001s)]
*  Am okay with what i'm doing. I'm helping people find [[01:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=4393.74s)]
*  peace, right [[01:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=4398.22s)]
*  Yeah, it's man it's so fascinating how like if you can't if you don't feel loved or if something makes you feel so [[01:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=4401.42s)]
*  Unloved or so damaged that then you it's very hard to feel love after that [[01:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=4406.84s)]
*  Because I think there's just receptors in you that just do not trust it or just do not trust the world [[01:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=4411.740000000001s)]
*  Almost in a weird way and I don't even think you can access it sometimes [[01:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=4418.14s)]
*  Like that's the that's the such hard thing is to be able to access [[01:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=4423.02s)]
*  Why or what or how to change it to get the clay in your hands, you know, it feels [[01:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=4428.54s)]
*  like you just [[01:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=4435.18s)]
*  Can't find it, you know [[01:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=4437.26s)]
*  So it's fascinating to hear that there's opportunities that this could be a way where people can [[01:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=4440.06s)]
*  I'm I'm [[01:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=4444.54s)]
*  You believe it. I believe it. I do I really do because um, i've seen it work. I've seen it work [[01:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=4446.06s)]
*  on a lot of people and it it's one of those things where [[01:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=4451.58s)]
*  It's it's like you get to see these people come to you and they're they're just broken [[01:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=4456.14s)]
*  And and the first time you hear them laugh [[01:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=4460.54s)]
*  And or smile and you're just like it it's [[01:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=4464.54s)]
*  It's i'm in the right place. Yeah [[01:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=4469.42s)]
*  That's fascinating man, yeah, I noticed after a couple of treatments i'd had an idea I was running [[01:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=4475.34s)]
*  One day and I just had like a good idea [[01:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=4480.78s)]
*  And I used to have good ideas all the time [[01:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=4483.02s)]
*  I mean i'm just i'm judging my own ideas, but I thought they were pretty good [[01:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=4484.860000000001s)]
*  But but I used to have ideas a lot and I just for like a year [[01:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=4487.26s)]
*  I just hadn't even gotten an idea like i've just been kind of living with the pieces of every day, you know [[01:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=4490.860000000001s)]
*  And it's been fine life has been fine. I'm not [[01:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=4496.14s)]
*  I'm not complaining. I'm not asking for any pity [[01:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=4498.62s)]
*  I'm just explaining where i'm at but but I hadn't found it gotten anything new to come out of my brain [[01:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=4500.46s)]
*  right now and so I noticed that I was running by some turkeys somewhere at this park and then [[01:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=4506.06s)]
*  I don't know. I just got like an idea that was like fun and it made me laugh. It made me smile [[01:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=4512.06s)]
*  I was like, oh man, what a gift like [[01:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=4516.3s)]
*  When something's able to just kind of travel through us and make us feel good [[01:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=4518.780000000001s)]
*  Which is how we probably should be a lot of times [[01:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=4522.06s)]
*  You know is to be a conduit for joy to at least pass through right instead of being kind of a [[01:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=4524.3s)]
*  A place where something is put up a fence or something is put up like a firewall or you know different elements like you're saying [[01:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=4531.26s)]
*  Yeah [[01:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=4537.820000000001s)]
*  um [[01:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=4538.54s)]
*  What are the what are what are some of the side effects that we honestly do not know about because just to be very honest and transparent with [[01:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=4540.54s)]
*  people who are considering this treatment, so there's there's [[01:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=4547.02s)]
*  There are limitations like their actual limitations like you can't really have problems with like [[01:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=4551.02s)]
*  Psychotic type problems or schizophrenic type problems. It doesn't see that it it's like [[01:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=4558.9400000000005s)]
*  It doesn't work. That wouldn't be cool. Yeah. No, and if you have a if you have problems with seizures, you really got to [[01:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=4565.580000000001s)]
*  Look into that because it used to be that ketamine was an automatic. No if you have a seizure disorder [[01:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=4571.740000000001s)]
*  Um and and depending on what's going on with that they're looking into it. Um, but um, [[01:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=4577.58s)]
*  the other things is like sometimes what you get is is [[01:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=4583.259999999999s)]
*  Um patients actually vomit [[01:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=4587.58s)]
*  And and it happens and I can almost see it coming now [[01:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=4590.78s)]
*  it's almost like a [[01:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=4595.58s)]
*  The physical need to expel [[01:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=4598.46s)]
*  Bad. Oh interesting [[01:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=4600.94s)]
*  So so like i've taken a couple patients very recently and they were super overwhelmed like way overwhelmed crushingly [[01:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=4603.259999999999s)]
*  and [[01:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=4611.66s)]
*  And um, and they they just started vomiting and I knew it was going to happen and it wasn't a problem [[01:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=4612.7s)]
*  But they didn't understand it. I was like, yep [[01:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=4619.099999999999s)]
*  It's like you needed to get it out. Wow. It was like it was like a metaphysical [[01:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=4621.099999999999s)]
*  expulsion of [[01:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=4625.719999999999s)]
*  Badness from them. Oh, yeah, and um, and so that it doesn't happen very often though [[01:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=4627.58s)]
*  I can see that [[01:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=4633.0199999999995s)]
*  I could really see that sometimes [[01:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=4634.78s)]
*  I think all types of things like that are a mole or something you see somebody with a mole and say that's a bad somebody [[01:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=4636.0599999999995s)]
*  You know, that's a bad idea or something you had or that's a something, you know [[01:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=4640.62s)]
*  That's something bad that happened to you, you know [[01:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=4644.139999999999s)]
*  Or sometimes you see like someone [[01:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=4646.379999999999s)]
*  Like i'll feel sometimes like when i'm really going through therapy and it's going pretty good [[01:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=4648.78s)]
*  I'll get pretty close to this feeling like there's something in my throat that I never was able to say or like to talk [[01:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=4652.0599999999995s)]
*  About when I was young. Yeah, I was afraid to talk [[01:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=4657.0199999999995s)]
*  And so I can almost feel the mass whatever it's not, you know, it's all probably in my head, but it feels very real [[01:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=4660.54s)]
*  It's all those connections from your you know, your your core. Yeah emotional centers are are they're [[01:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=4667.58s)]
*  They're reaching out into everything and you know [[01:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=4674.54s)]
*  If you think about a nerve connection think of like a a thread of hair from an experience to somewhere else in your brain [[01:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=4676.86s)]
*  It's still there. It's just how how often it lights up and and it starts pushing on things and [[01:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=4683.179999999999s)]
*  And that's you know, like post-traumatic stress is the hair is the size of my you know pinky [[01:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=4689.26s)]
*  Yeah, and so it's it's got domain over your operating system so to speak. Yeah [[01:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=4693.9800000000005s)]
*  and um, what's the question that came in for uh [[01:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=4699.58s)]
*  Do you have another question that came in sean? [[01:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=4702.78s)]
*  I know we have one from a young. Uh, yeah, let's play this fellow right here. See, uh, what is going on my brother [[01:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=4704.86s)]
*  I just got a question for [[01:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=4709.82s)]
*  Dr. Ketamine as he's in the house [[01:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=4711.66s)]
*  Um, this is sam from sydney here and you know down in sydney [[01:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=4714.219999999999s)]
*  We we're team ketamine down here. You know, we got that special k on deck I would say [[01:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=4719.58s)]
*  um, my question for the doc is [[01:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=4725.34s)]
*  Is this an addictive substance and are they will there be lasting effects from this kind of therapy? [[01:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=4728.219999999999s)]
*  Um because I can tell you from second hand right now. I got some friends that could argue there are some [[01:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=4734.46s)]
*  Little more long-term effects from this substance and it could be quite addictive [[01:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=4741.34s)]
*  Some fellas getting banged out out there in australia. I'm off gang gang gang brother. Cheers, man [[01:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=4746.139999999999s)]
*  Yeah, what are some of those? What are some of the effects? So it is addictive [[01:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=4751.099999999999s)]
*  um, it is not that addictive but I have [[01:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=4755.26s)]
*  Talked to somebody who was completely addicted to ketamine. Wow now the [[01:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=4759.58s)]
*  problem with ketamine is [[01:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=4765.0199999999995s)]
*  Is it's unclear but this is what? [[01:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=4768.06s)]
*  the best sort of notion on what's going to happen to people is if you're always [[01:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=4770.860000000001s)]
*  Taking a substance that causes neural growth and neural change [[01:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=4775.34s)]
*  We'll keep that ball rolling and see what happens to your mind [[01:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=4779.34s)]
*  so so if you're always changing it and you're always growing it your ability to be you is going to [[01:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=4782.54s)]
*  Be called into question if you're always abusing it [[01:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=4790.22s)]
*  It's not like you know opiates you can take opiates for 20 years and come out of it [[01:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=4793.0199999999995s)]
*  um and still be your [[01:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=4797.5s)]
*  person [[01:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=4800.379999999999s)]
*  ketamine is [[01:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=4801.58s)]
*  putting like [[01:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=4802.94s)]
*  Putting your brain in a grow box and you're trying to grow all these new sprouts and all these new connections so that you can [[01:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=4804.0599999999995s)]
*  Connect in a healthier way [[01:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=4809.98s)]
*  to to traverse injuries from the past [[01:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=4811.98s)]
*  Okay. Now we know this is happening at the microscopic level physically [[01:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=4815.66s)]
*  So if you keep doing that all day long [[01:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=4820.46s)]
*  for years [[01:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=4822.7s)]
*  Where's what's going to end up remember that bowl of ramen you keep? [[01:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=4824.139999999999s)]
*  Putting more ramen in there. I don't know what's going to happen, but I can [[01:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=4828.46s)]
*  Probably reasonably predict that these people are not going to be the same. Wow and not in a good way [[01:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=4832.94s)]
*  That's why again, you know the the research was [[01:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=4838.54s)]
*  a set of infusions [[01:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=4842.62s)]
*  in order to diverse [[01:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=4845.099999999999s)]
*  Something that is essentially beleaguering you in a way that's preventing you from having access to wellness [[01:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=4847.18s)]
*  Long-term dosing of it [[01:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=4853.58s)]
*  I [[01:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=4856.54s)]
*  At a lower level i'm not sure if that is gonna [[01:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=4858.06s)]
*  I I don't do it. You don't prescribe it. No, I don't because I I have seen a lot of things and [[01:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=4863.820000000001s)]
*  I want it to be done in front of me. I want the like like the chap from earlier [[01:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=4870.780000000001s)]
*  You want the event to be very meaningful you want the sequence of events to be very [[01:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=4876.14s)]
*  Enlightening and very [[01:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=4883.0s)]
*  Meaningful and connecting to yourself emotionally you want you want those six sessions to be sort of like a time [[01:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=4886.38s)]
*  of of introspection and healing that's been [[01:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=4892.38s)]
*  Brought to an immensely higher level because you're seeing ketamine a lot [[01:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=4895.66s)]
*  You I don't want that to be wasted. So I want to do it right [[01:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=4899.9s)]
*  From beginning from before beginning to afterwards [[01:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=4904.780000000001s)]
*  But I don't want to be picking up that tool very regularly because because I don't want [[01:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=4908.3s)]
*  To use that as the crutch because we've done that crutch with other substances in the past and it hasn't worked out so well [[01:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=4913.5s)]
*  Yeah, it gets bad it gets and then people also have to make their own choices [[01:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=4920.38s)]
*  But if there's some addictive nature to it, then yeah, it can be tricky [[01:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=4923.660000000001s)]
*  And that's what I want to say [[01:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=4927.34s)]
*  Like i'm not telling anybody to go get this therapy or saying that this is [[01:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=4928.14s)]
*  You know, I wanted to have an experience with it [[01:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=4932.62s)]
*  Because i'm going to try to get off of antidepressants. Yeah, so [[01:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=4935.18s)]
*  I'm working with my doctor now and trying like slowly wean myself off [[01:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=4939.1s)]
*  Which is some which is cool the the place that I went the there they have like some follow-through there with like trying to [[01:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=4943.18s)]
*  Help me like do that and and manage that so i'm excited about that and i'm still working with my regular therapist [[01:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=4948.22s)]
*  um [[01:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=4954.22s)]
*  But yeah, I definitely wanted to have the experiences so I knew kind of what it was like [[01:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=4955.18s)]
*  And what's possible, you know, I love to kind of figure out how i'm thinking and feeling and why and stuff like that, you know [[01:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=4959.5s)]
*  So [[01:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=4967.42s)]
*  it's it's nice to kind of see if what things I can get get through and get away from and [[01:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=4968.38s)]
*  I find that like anchors I can pull up kind of find that, you know in in my practice [[01:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=4973.5s)]
*  About half my patients don't get ketamine like we we you know, it's sort of like why are you here? [[01:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=4979.26s)]
*  And they're more like they don't know why they're there [[01:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=4985.1s)]
*  They're like they they want access to well-being they want relief from distress [[01:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=4987.740000000001s)]
*  That's what they really want. Right, but they come in with like diagnoses. I'm like, well, let's talk about what you what's really going on [[01:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=4994.38s)]
*  And then you know, we we talk and we we gotta you know, it's like we gotta get to know each other [[01:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=5001.42s)]
*  It's not like i'm like hey, yeah here get out [[01:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=5005.820000000001s)]
*  um and [[01:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=5008.54s)]
*  They may turn into ketamine patients once we find like hard stops places that are are [[01:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=5011.18s)]
*  You know, like I shared earlier. I had that lady [[01:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=5017.1s)]
*  She was an academy patient. Okay [[01:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=5022.06s)]
*  And as we got to know each other and I was sort of helping shape her therapy using other things [[01:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=5025.18s)]
*  We she felt comfortable sharing me with some pretty disturbing stuff [[01:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=5030.620000000001s)]
*  And then she shared some even more disturbing and then she she couldn't she stopped [[01:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=5035.18s)]
*  I was like, um [[01:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=5039.42s)]
*  Yeah, it's sort of like let's let's change gears because we're running into some very [[01:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=5042.38s)]
*  Emotionally distressing things that she couldn't articulate at that point and in order to get through those I wanted to protect her [[01:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=5048.04s)]
*  So that's when we slid over into the the ketamine room [[01:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=5055.9s)]
*  and now she's she's about she's in process and she's [[01:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=5059.18s)]
*  Oh, you could just see the light in her eyes now. She's [[01:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=5063.42s)]
*  You know, it's like she it's like it's not just like go get ketamine. It's like why are you here? [[01:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=5066.9400000000005s)]
*  right and and [[01:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=5071.179999999999s)]

*  and [[01:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=5077.5s)]
*  Well, there was an experience one moment [[01:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=5078.78s)]
*  I had an experience at one point where I felt like I ended up like in a corner of the world kind of [[01:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=5080.139999999999s)]
*  It was kind of like I felt like you ever been in like a video game and you get stuck somewhere on it [[01:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=5084.62s)]
*  You can't even move like your guy gets stuck [[01:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=5089.099999999999s)]
*  You're just I felt like I got stuck at like the edge of the universe like where the universe [[01:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=5091.179999999999s)]
*  Like we like I finally found like the two walls of the universe like the ends of it [[01:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=5096.54s)]
*  And I got stuck like in the corner [[01:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=5100.700000000001s)]
*  And I don't know what was going on. Were you leaving the chair or coming back to the chair? [[01:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=5103.740000000001s)]

*  It felt like an experience to me, right? You know [[01:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=5185.0199999999995s)]
*  um [[01:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=5188.3s)]
*  I felt like I was kind of grateful for the experience [[01:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=5189.58s)]
*  I was grateful to be back from the experience whenever I got back from the like trip or whatever you kind of go on [[01:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=5191.26s)]
*  During it or whatever like the visual the experience the out of body kind of experience [[01:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=5196.0599999999995s)]

*  Neck I was there was a lot. It was I was sliding down stuff a lot of like moving along huge [[01:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=5224.7s)]
*  I don't know if it was like electronic land sides of walls [[01:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=5232.94s)]
*  At a lady recently she could hear [[01:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=5238.7s)]
*  I got like these pictures of a forest or in my one of my rooms and she could hear the forest [[01:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=5241.9800000000005s)]
*  Wow, and then she was like then she could hear a lawnmower like and I was like, that's pretty cool [[01:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=5248.78s)]
*  You know because it was she was not disturbed. She was just like oh, yeah, I can hear the forest and I was like [[01:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=5253.9s)]
*  That was a first. Yeah, the auditories were were are not as common. That's strong [[01:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=5258.78s)]
*  Is there a reason why do we all need therapy now what's going on have we got are we weak people do you think are we [[01:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=5264.46s)]
*  You know, it's funny because i'll talk about therapy and stuff with my mother and she doesn't [[01:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=5272.62s)]
*  She doesn't not believe in it, but she's just like you just keep moving on, you know, you keep going [[01:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=5277.34s)]
*  She's more of like you tough it out type of vibe and I come from more of like a [[01:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=5281.66s)]
*  Well, why well what's going on like that kind of type of vibe? You know [[01:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=5287.1s)]
*  I think [[01:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=5291.42s)]
*  You think it's an american problem like not problem. Do you think it's like a I think it's a [[01:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=5293.1s)]
*  There's like a [[01:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=5299.820000000001s)]
*  There's a couple things resiliency, okay people people don't bounce back [[01:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=5303.02s)]
*  um [[01:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=5309.02s)]
*  Very as well as they think they do [[01:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=5310.620000000001s)]
*  um, and the other thing is is like [[01:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=5313.26s)]
*  how [[01:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=5316.38s)]
*  How old you are and how like i'm sorry [[01:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=5319.26s)]
*  young [[01:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=5323.42s)]
*  And having problems happen to you when you're young [[01:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=5326.38s)]
*  Is very problematic [[01:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=5329.740000000001s)]
*  And because if you look at like say you're writing a program, okay, I got a coder here in nashville actually [[01:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=5332.9400000000005s)]
*  Um, you're writing a program. Okay, the earliest code you're writing. Okay is [[01:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=5339.820000000001s)]
*  Sort of goes through everything [[01:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=5344.14s)]
*  Okay, so when you're when you're a child, that's your earliest programming so it tends to resonate through your life [[01:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=5346.14s)]
*  And if you're not being shaped [[01:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=5353.18s)]
*  With sort of like a good societal [[01:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=5356.3s)]
*  Structure good parenting structure, you know, they talk about keeping people out of the system [[01:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=5358.84s)]
*  Or once they're in the system, the system doesn't work. Okay. Well, how did they get in the system? Right? [[01:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=5363.34s)]
*  So where do we? [[01:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=5367.9800000000005s)]
*  Where do we set the boundaries? [[01:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=5370.06s)]
*  From the get-go, you know [[01:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=5372.22s)]
*  They used to have tv shows like um leave it to beaver and things like that [[01:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=5373.740000000001s)]
*  It was like sort of like showing you how people are supposed to behave [[01:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=5377.740000000001s)]
*  And and angie griffith show they were they were very like structured on this sort of [[01:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=5381.34s)]
*  False reality of how people are supposed to conduct themselves, but it was very civilized. It wasn't dysfunctional [[01:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=5387.66s)]
*  It was based on like love authority [[01:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=5393.34s)]
*  respect [[01:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=5396.2s)]
*  Um and things like that and then as you sort of everybody does their own thing now [[01:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=5397.34s)]
*  Well, they sort of do their own thing and everything [[01:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=5401.74s)]
*  and so [[01:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=5403.82s)]
*  the the the underpinnings of youth have sort of [[01:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=5405.02s)]
*  gotten [[01:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=5408.94s)]
*  More flexible, but that also means that their emotions are also more flexible in all directions. Does that make sense? [[01:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=5410.7s)]
*  At the end part doesn't [[01:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=5418.219999999999s)]
*  I don't know like I mean, I mean, I know it it probably should I just don't know [[01:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=5420.78s)]
*  If I was different person, I would understand it. I bet like I the way I grew up is like you [[01:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=5425.339999999999s)]
*  you do xyz right and you chug through right and [[01:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=5430.379999999999s)]
*  and [[01:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=5434.7s)]
*  you [[01:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=5436.299999999999s)]
*  Everything was supposed to be fine [[01:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=5437.9s)]
*  but as [[01:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=5439.66s)]
*  As we've moved forward as a society like my parents and and a lot of people's parents [[01:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=5441.179999999999s)]
*  They had jobs where they had pensions and they had they had more stability, right? [[01:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=5445.74s)]
*  And it's less stable now you have you have more flexibility, but with more flexibility comes more [[01:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=5450.0599999999995s)]
*  Uncertainty. Ah, yeah, so so people are like more questions [[01:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=5455.639999999999s)]
*  People are feeling less secure in the world [[01:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=5459.74s)]
*  In reality, they're probably more secure, right? [[01:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=5463.0199999999995s)]
*  But they don't feel that way and like after 2020 [[01:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=5465.42s)]
*  you know [[01:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=5469.42s)]
*  2020 is like a rubber band, you know, the the suicide rate actually came down. Okay, well [[01:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=5470.62s)]
*  What's gonna happen? Right? I don't know because I have people showing up in my office now that are like [[01:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=5477.42s)]
*  They're beginning to cope with what happened to them in 2020 [[01:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=5483.58s)]
*  and [[01:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=5488.14s)]
*  You know, yeah, that's why we're here [[01:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=5489.74s)]
*  Yeah, it's interesting man, I mean I you know [[01:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=5491.74s)]
*  I had like during the pandemic I had like five friends that overdosed and died like that [[01:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=5494.86s)]
*  Just because they couldn't get to recovery meetings. I think I think it's they didn't ever say that they're dead, but they [[01:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=5499.0199999999995s)]
*  You know, I believe if they still had opportunity to get to meetings which were closed [[01:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=5505.0199999999995s)]
*  It would have just been helpful to some of them, you know [[01:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=5510.219999999999s)]
*  Just to still have the ability to go like once you lose that connection [[01:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=5513.9s)]
*  You start to isolate more than so much stuff happens [[01:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=5517.099999999999s)]
*  You get stuck in your own world [[01:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=5519.66s)]
*  And yeah, I think some of that too. I I think we also were at a time where there's just so much technology now we get such a quick [[01:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=5522.38s)]
*  Reflections of us that are like just out in the world that aren't that aren't like rooted in ourselves [[01:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=5529.26s)]
*  I think that that can be very unnerving to people the [[01:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=5535.9s)]
*  the [[01:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=5540.62s)]
*  you know, I [[01:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=5541.58s)]
*  Share with patients. I'm like, you know being connect being connected the feeling of being connected [[01:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=5543.0199999999995s)]
*  Being connected the feeling of being connected. It's not the icing on the cake. It is the cake and you see that [[01:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=5547.34s)]
*  We're we're an incredibly disconnected society [[01:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=5554.06s)]
*  You go into any city and nobody knows anybody. Yeah, even though they're living next to a million people [[01:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=5557.5s)]
*  And if and and you can look at the the history of like [[01:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=5563.82s)]
*  Earth, you know, you go to these blue zones where people live unusually long, right? Okay, you go to like okinawa costa rica [[01:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=5566.9400000000005s)]
*  Um, like I think sardinia croatia these these places are not terribly affluent [[01:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=5573.900000000001s)]
*  But people are like really happy and they live a really long time and they're like why? [[01:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=5579.18s)]
*  You know a big chunk of it is [[01:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=5583.820000000001s)]
*  They they have this thing with community like they're all connected. They're all part of they're together [[01:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=5586.38s)]
*  And so when you what's the the opposite end of that is everybody's alone? [[01:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=5593.02s)]
*  And when you're isolated bad things happen [[01:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=5596.860000000001s)]
*  Yeah, and I think that's one of the things that happens to our brain our brain is a [[01:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=5599.9800000000005s)]
*  is literally a piece of machinery that's [[01:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=5603.740000000001s)]
*  Has the ability to connect with other [[01:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=5607.26s)]
*  You have to people you have and it's like so when we take our brain away from that and we're not doing it [[01:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=5609.5s)]
*  Of course our brain is going to get sick. Yeah, you know, it just makes sense. It's like a plant, you know [[01:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=5613.9800000000005s)]
*  Um, yeah, I mean it's not like a plant but it's like something being connected is is is crucial [[01:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=5619.02s)]
*  yeah, and you know [[01:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=5625.18s)]
*  My our our family, um, my wife's grandparents are still with us so so they're you know in their [[01:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=5627.42s)]
*  90s and um [[01:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=5636.38s)]
*  And some of their brothers and sisters are still with us and so last year it was like [[01:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=5639.34s)]
*  Awful because these are people we would see every week. Yeah, and we I mean all the time we would see them [[01:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=5644.46s)]
*  They show up to like events and and then for like a year they disappeared [[01:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=5650.06s)]
*  Yeah, and like they'd stop and you'd wave at them because you're so afraid to [[01:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=5655.0199999999995s)]
*  you know, because I worked i'm doing my thing and and I hadn't been vaccinated yet and so [[01:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=5659.58s)]
*  Everybody's living in fear and everybody's isolating and you're just like this is awful. And then you see that [[01:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=5665.34s)]
*  You see that, you know that you see that match.com commercial with the satan dates 2020, you know match made in hell [[01:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=5670.7s)]
*  It's the funniest thing [[01:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=5678.0599999999995s)]
*  But it's it's a it's a great sort of representation of how bad last year was damn [[01:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=5679.58s)]
*  Yeah, I believe in satan though, but I would like to see the commercial but i'll probably see it [[01:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=5686.78s)]
*  We can watch it later on [[01:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=5691.42s)]
*  Um any other questions that came up so there was one from a young lady that came up [[01:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=5693.0199999999995s)]
*  You want to play that real quick and then we'll get you [[01:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=5696.22s)]
*  Uh, and then we can close it out. We've gone almost two hours, huh sean? [[01:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=5698.7s)]
*  Hour and a half. Okay, cool cool [[01:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=5703.5s)]
*  Hi there, my name is cortney. Um, I actually have my first, uh ketamine therapy appointment scheduled for [[01:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=5706.22s)]
*  next month and um, i've had some [[01:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=5713.5s)]
*  prep appointments, but I just wanted to get your point of view as to [[01:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=5717.1s)]
*  um the potentials for how ketamine therapy can [[01:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=5722.22s)]
*  benefit people with [[01:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=5727.74s)]
*  Complex post-traumatic stress syndrome. Um, I know there's a lot of information [[01:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=5730.38s)]
*  Um going around right now and I am just really interested to hear, uh your thoughts on it. Thank you so much [[01:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=5735.280000000001s)]
*  Gang gang. Thanks for and we may have answered that really didn't we did we not? Um [[01:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=5742.160000000001s)]
*  I can I can answer it in a way. Um [[01:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=5747.4400000000005s)]
*  so [[01:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=5751.04s)]
*  Ketamine therapy is [[01:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=5753.52s)]
*  I think that a more [[01:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=5756.72s)]
*  genuine or or credible way to [[01:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=5759.76s)]
*  To look at what ketamine therapy does is it allows you access [[01:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=5762.5599999999995s)]
*  to healing [[01:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=5767.28s)]
*  To to reconnecting with yourself from seeing pain that you have in a different way [[01:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=5768.72s)]
*  like at a more like [[01:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=5774.16s)]
*  Ethereal way, right? [[01:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=5776.22s)]
*  so so a diagnosis [[01:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=5778.0s)]
*  um is [[01:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=5780.48s)]
*  Not really a description that is is what we're trying to do [[01:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=5782.5599999999995s)]
*  Why the diagnosis is is a better way to look at what we're trying to approach and like I have people who come to me [[01:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=5786.88s)]
*  who've had very bad things happen to them and so so I want them to be able to [[01:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=5794.0s)]
*  Reconnect to that part of them that's stuck in there [[01:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=5800.32s)]
*  And if and if that if that part of their emotional [[01:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=5803.36s)]
*  baggage that's sort of pinned [[01:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=5806.639999999999s)]
*  To that moment if they can connect to it and grieve and get that that release that emotional release of connection [[01:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=5809.04s)]
*  then [[01:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=5816.5599999999995s)]
*  They can begin to feel better [[01:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=5818.24s)]
*  And it's not like we're checking off like oh anxiety check ptsd check. It's more like [[01:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=5820.24s)]
*  What's what's [[01:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=5826.719999999999s)]
*  You know what? Why are you hurting so much? [[01:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=5828.5599999999995s)]
*  And and how does that show up in your life because you can take somebody who's struggling with something and somebody will have [[01:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=5831.679999999999s)]
*  Insomnia and you can take somebody who's struggling with something and they'll have depression and so it's like what really is the distress? [[01:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=5838.219999999999s)]
*  What really is the root of their pain as opposed to like a diagnosis and [[01:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=5845.36s)]
*  It's more fundamental it gets back to what's wrong [[01:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=5851.92s)]
*  Yeah, you know as i'm hearing you say that I [[01:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=5855.68s)]
*  I I felt like sometimes when i'm in therapy, it's hard. Sometimes it's like if my mood is [[01:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=5857.76s)]
*  Isn't that great that day? I won't even want to talk to my therapist. I don't want to share with them [[01:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=5862.88s)]
*  sometimes I want to be like [[01:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=5866.96s)]
*  You know, I want to be [[01:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=5868.96s)]
*  kind of [[01:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=5871.36s)]
*  I don't know sometimes I won't really be in the mood [[01:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=5872.8s)]
*  Sometimes i'll keep information from them because i'm scared to share it or because I don't feel comfortable [[01:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=5876.16s)]
*  Right, you know, but this kind of I felt like this kind of takes away some of that [[01:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=5881.28s)]
*  For me anyway took away some of that my own thoughts my own bullshit whatever i'm attaching to whatever is [[01:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=5886.96s)]
*  Bothering me in my life and let me kind of just see what was bothering me. Yeah a little protection [[01:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=5893.52s)]
*  Yeah, it just kind of like it didn't it just [[01:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=5899.839999999999s)]
*  It felt like I was just there to get some help. It was like it was almost like going in for like a deep deep [[01:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=5904.24s)]
*  Deeper deal. Yeah, you're you're all your normal defense mechanisms are sort of taking a break [[01:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=5910.32s)]
*  Yeah, and you can be more genuine with your emotional state and and in that state [[01:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=5915.759999999999s)]
*  You can be like what really hurts versus what have I convinced myself as my problem versus [[01:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=5921.5199999999995s)]
*  What is really bouncing around in the back that I don't want to look at and and it's just it's it's a [[01:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=5926.240000000001s)]
*  Yeah, it's a much more like rich [[01:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=5932.96s)]
*  Sort of conversation with yourself. Yeah [[01:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=5936.400000000001s)]
*  Yeah, man, it was it was definitely [[01:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=5939.84s)]
*  It was it was really interesting [[01:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=5942.56s)]
*  You know, I would like to get some more tools so then I go when I go back [[01:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=5944.64s)]
*  What are some tools you think that I could use when I go back? [[01:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=5947.68s)]
*  To or what are tools that someone can use when they go into [[01:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=5950.32s)]
*  Their ketamine therapy after they've you know met with their therapists and stuff like that [[01:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=5954.16s)]
*  What are things that they you feel like they can do to best get? [[01:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=5958.32s)]
*  The most effectiveness out of their experience. Well [[01:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=5961.92s)]
*  So a couple of things are is kind of getting some information on where you are [[01:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=5965.28s)]
*  So what I what I like is I want patients to get a couple of labs because I want some I want some pointers [[01:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=5969.679999999999s)]
*  I want I want some data to [[01:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=5975.44s)]
*  To show me where they are [[01:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=5977.44s)]
*  So I get them have them get a vitamin d. I have them get a high sensitivity crp test crp is like a test for inflammation [[01:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=5979.04s)]
*  I um, I do some [[01:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=5986.32s)]
*  Brief questionnaires. So we have this little online thing [[01:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=5989.04s)]
*  They're little and and they get these health questionnaires, but it's like it generates a number [[01:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=5993.28s)]
*  It's like how distressed are you? Okay, and then we start sending that to them every week or so [[01:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=5998.08s)]
*  So we want to see what we're doing. We want to see the baselines. Where are we starting? [[01:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=6003.52s)]
*  Because what are we doing? [[01:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=6007.120000000001s)]
*  And so we get some data on the front end and I get to know them on the front end and then as you go into [[01:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=6008.56s)]
*  the ketamine [[01:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=6013.280000000001s)]
*  You sort of organize [[01:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=6014.72s)]
*  Your I think I mentioned that I got this big thing of paper and and I want them to like look at their life [[01:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=6017.040000000001s)]
*  Because that's how you sort of want to like where what are we doing? Where are we going with it? Where do we propose? [[01:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=6022.72s)]
*  That you're destroying [[01:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=6029.120000000001s)]
*  Your [[01:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=6031.12s)]
*  Distress is sort of seated [[01:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=6033.12s)]
*  You know what happened right and and so then you kind of know where to [[01:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=6035.84s)]
*  toggle it and what can they do if they are [[01:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=6040.8s)]
*  if if the patient is sort of [[01:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=6045.44s)]
*  Like how can they best help you and the medicine or the therapist and the medicine? Uh, usually it's it's um, just [[01:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=6049.04s)]
*  I gotta get to know them a little bit. So so it's like I gotta [[01:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=6057.68s)]
*  I gotta know what brought them to me, right? Like what really brought them to me as opposed to a diagnosis [[01:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=6061.12s)]
*  I see is there a state that they can be in is there an attitude that they can have or is there? [[01:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=6066.0s)]
*  Absolutely. So so we know now that um [[01:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=6071.36s)]
*  a [[01:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=6075.12s)]
*  a predictor of [[01:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=6076.16s)]
*  failure [[01:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=6077.68s)]
*  is resistance [[01:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=6078.88s)]
*  Or the inability to accept it [[01:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=6080.64s)]
*  So if you're basically it's if if you're not willing to let go into it, it's not going to work that well [[01:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=6083.28s)]
*  Okay, so we know this it's actually a study popped up. I saw it a month ago [[01:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=6089.04s)]
*  I can't remember what it was but they actually have some predictors now and the resistance to the process [[01:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=6094.08s)]
*  is [[01:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=6100.400000000001s)]
*  Is going to keep it from working [[01:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=6101.68s)]
*  For you. Okay. So if you're like, I don't want to do this. I'm not ready to let go [[01:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=6103.68s)]
*  I would get yourself into a better headspace first [[01:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=6108.88s)]
*  And that's why we like we want to get them into a better headspace going into it [[01:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=6111.84s)]
*  Like I got to get them sleeping first if you're not sleeping you can't do anything [[01:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=6115.12s)]
*  So first thing I do is get people sleeping because then you can you got to be able to sleep to do anything [[01:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=6118.5599999999995s)]
*  And so I try to get my patients sleeping first. Oh you do [[01:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=6124.32s)]
*  I mean like when they come in so like I I usually see my patients for a couple of weeks [[01:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=6128.0s)]
*  At least before they come in so I want to get them sleeping on a regular schedule [[01:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=6131.76s)]
*  Oh sleeping on a regular schedule. I thought you meant put them to sleep when they get there [[01:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=6134.72s)]
*  No, no, no, no [[01:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=6137.92s)]
*  No, i'm sorry like like so prep work is I want to get their sort of their life sort of moderated to some degree [[01:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=6138.88s)]
*  So that the process is far more useful, right? [[01:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=6144.8s)]
*  Unless they're in like really bad shape and then you just do it because it's it's harm reduction [[01:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=6147.280000000001s)]
*  That's a different category. Yeah my comp dude. I had to go to a comedy show one night after it and that was [[01:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=6151.92s)]
*  Jesus how'd it go? It was okay, man. I mean it was pretty good. Honestly, but it wasn't [[01:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=6158.240000000001s)]
*  Top-notch, you know, I just felt a little glitchy. I had a I was you know, I felt like I was about two centimeters off of my [[01:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=6164.64s)]
*  Regular skin and and and [[01:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=6172.88s)]
*  I'm in this uh, i'm in this fellowship of people out of [[01:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=6175.44s)]
*  the integrative psychiatry institute out of boulder and we had a little get together like a zoom, uh session and [[01:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=6180.16s)]
*  There was uh, one of the [[01:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=6188.24s)]
*  psychiatrists she had just gotten back from surgery on ketamine [[01:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=6190.46s)]
*  and she was like talking to all of us and we were like [[01:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=6194.5599999999995s)]
*  And it was it was fascinating she was like fresh [[01:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=6198.4800000000005s)]
*  And she had gotten like something done to her and and we're just sitting there watching this and I was like [[01:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=6201.68s)]
*  Wow, and she was having like insights about her relationship with her mother and that went back like [[01:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=6206.4800000000005s)]
*  decades and and [[01:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=6211.5s)]
*  You know, it's it's it's fascinating. I mean you stick around you just hang out in the [[01:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=6214.320000000001s)]
*  In the in the areas where people are doing this and you can really you kind of get an idea of [[01:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=6219.76s)]
*  What this is doing to people it's just the insights [[01:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=6224.72s)]
*  And the perceptions and the healing that that are sort of swimming around in this whole thing [[01:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=6228.4s)]
*  Um, it's not covered by a lot of insurances, right? [[01:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=6234.88s)]
*  Not yet. Not yet. So so it depends on where you are, you know [[01:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=6237.92s)]
*  Where I am not so much. Um, but uh, my understanding is if you kind of like the further west you go [[01:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=6243.04s)]
*  Yeah, the insurers are are you know more friendly to it? [[01:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=6249.2s)]
*  However, interestingly [[01:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=6253.28s)]
*  Because of 2020 mental health is actually getting um [[01:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=6254.96s)]
*  Much more [[01:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=6259.599999999999s)]
*  um [[01:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=6260.88s)]
*  It's been considered much more important historically in [[01:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=6262.32s)]
*  In sort of all the industries and so that is good because a it's long overdue and b [[01:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=6266.48s)]
*  It means that [[01:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=6273.04s)]
*  people can [[01:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=6274.24s)]
*  really get [[01:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=6275.599999999999s)]
*  access to [[01:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=6277.04s)]
*  kind of healing as opposed to limping and and [[01:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=6278.8s)]
*  It's sort of like it's the hope of yeah everybody who's in this is that [[01:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=6283.28s)]
*  when you have somebody who's been harmed in a way that they [[01:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=6287.36s)]
*  Are not able to interact with the world in a way that is peaceful. You want to do everything you can [[01:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=6292.0s)]
*  In a way that is [[01:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=6299.28s)]
*  Safe and sort of research based [[01:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=6301.12s)]
*  To get them on the road again. Yeah, why not? [[01:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=6304.32s)]
*  well, i'm sure that 30 years ago or whenever there was a conversation between two people about like [[01:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=6307.28s)]
*  uh antidepressants that was just like this possibly, you know, it's like you never know like [[01:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=6312.8s)]
*  Something new is always coming along new things are always coming along and we're always evolving and stuff in different spaces [[01:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=6317.84s)]
*  And yeah, i'm certainly curious. I love the idea [[01:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=6323.36s)]
*  actually trying to find some healing as opposed to [[01:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=6326.5599999999995s)]
*  uh [[01:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=6330.0s)]
*  Getting a crutch every day, you know [[01:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=6331.2s)]
*  Because that starts to be ridiculous when I think of that every day [[01:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=6334.08s)]
*  I have to take a pill when I write when I get up just that my mind has to even think about that [[01:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=6336.48s)]
*  Instead of being able to be in this free space where it can just wake up [[01:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=6340.4s)]
*  Yeah, like it's kind of crazy to me, you know, it almost wonders how much of a hitch in my [[01:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=6344.08s)]
*  Vibe is that overall just that my brain knows right when it gets up that it has to remind me to go take a pill [[01:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=6350.639999999999s)]
*  It's like [[01:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=6356.0s)]
*  It's kind of weird, you know, it's kind of feels very unhuman [[01:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=6357.2s)]
*  um what what actually happens to your brain to the parts in your brain during the [[01:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=6361.04s)]
*  ketamine therapy [[01:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=6367.5199999999995s)]
*  um, so what what happens [[01:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=6369.12s)]
*  There's a bunch of there's actually two things that happen [[01:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=6372.08s)]
*  um [[01:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=6375.44s)]
*  the [[01:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=6377.12s)]
*  Receptors get tagged that are responsible for your like [[01:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=6378.88s)]
*  Anxiousness and depressive symptoms, but the other cool little thing is is there's a triggering cascade [[01:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=6383.099999999999s)]
*  Uh from a it's called bdnf and what it is is it helps your neurons like sort of [[01:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=6389.2s)]
*  change like grow little sprouts and and [[01:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=6395.36s)]
*  And the synapses the little ends can sort of become plastic and make make changes to your your nerves [[01:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=6398.64s)]
*  And they grow a little bit and you can actually see it. They've they've imaged this you can you can google it and find pictures of [[01:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=6405.84s)]
*  dendritic sprouting [[01:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=6412.3s)]
*  Um or dendritic spines that have been exposed to ketamine [[01:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=6414.0s)]
*  And so that's like actual [[01:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=6418.0s)]
*  like [[01:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=6420.16s)]
*  growth [[01:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=6421.04s)]
*  So if you think like if you're growing things in your head [[01:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=6422.4s)]
*  You know you can do something with it and that's that's like that that [[01:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=6426.56s)]
*  Cyborg stuff like you could have a new garden. Well, you and you slide an electrode in there [[01:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=6430.4800000000005s)]
*  And and all of a sudden you can like grow connections into different things and [[01:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=6435.28s)]
*  You know, you're gonna have high def out the rear no time on the back of your head and have a backup camera [[01:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=6439.52s)]
*  I mean [[01:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=6446.72s)]
*  You think about it. I mean [[01:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=6447.76s)]
*  We didn't have cell phones 20, you know, we didn't have an iphone 20 years ago [[01:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=6450.24s)]
*  So what we're going to go to the moon, um every day in 10 [[01:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=6453.6s)]
*  I I would bet we're going to be pretty augmented kids don't have any problem wearing electronic gear on their heads now. Yeah, so [[01:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=6459.120000000001s)]
*  I don't know. I'll have i'll have neurons growing onto a chip out my ears pretty soon. It'll be hey [[01:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=6466.88s)]
*  Be pretty freaky. Look, let me know how it goes. Yeah, okay [[01:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=6473.040000000001s)]
*  I'll call you i'll call you as long as you're the guinea pig first, man [[01:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=6476.72s)]
*  Uh, I think that'll work out. Uh, dr. Jason puller. Thank you so much for being here with us today, man [[01:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=6481.12s)]
*  You bet. Thank you. We really appreciate it, man [[01:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=6486.32s)]
*  Now i'm just floating on the breeze and I feel i'm falling like these leaves I must be [[01:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=6489.12s)]
*  corner stone [[01:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=6496.639999999999s)]
*  Oh, but when I reach that ground I'll share this piece of my life out I can feel it [[01:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=6499.92s)]
*  in my bones [[01:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=6507.44s)]
*  But it's gonna take [[01:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=6510.08s)]
*  A little time [[01:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=6512.96s)]
*  For me to set that parking brake and let myself all [[01:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=6516.08s)]
*  I'll sit and tell you my stories [[01:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=6528.0s)]
*  I will sing it just [[01:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=6540.24s)]
*  And i've been moving way too fast on the runaway train with a heavy load of my [[01:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=6548.24s)]
*  And these wheels that i've been riding on they're worn so thin that they're damn they're gone [[01:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKleqNGPZM&t=6558.879999999999s)]
