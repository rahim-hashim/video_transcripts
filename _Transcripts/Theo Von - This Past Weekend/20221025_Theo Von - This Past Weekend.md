*  Thank you for having me. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=158.0s)]
*  Thank you for having me. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=160.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=162.0s)]
*  You know, because that might send the interview in a different direction, subconsciously. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=163.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's a good point, man. I hadn't thought about that. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=166.0s)]
*  I think there are people you get around them, and when they got that odor, [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=169.0s)]
*  sometimes it repels you. Sometimes I notice it's almost like a well, it feels a little bit like, [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=176.0s)]
*  not welcoming, but there's a human space in there that's kind of okay. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=184.0s)]
*  Like you're fallible, you smell like I do. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=189.0s)]
*  Yeah, like, okay, I'm going to ride this guy. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=192.0s)]
*  I'll give this guy a chance. He smells like shit. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=195.0s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. We are a couple stench bunnies. I'll ride with this homie right here, dog. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=199.0s)]
*  But I just, you know, I took a couple years off too, and just the other day I put it on, [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=206.0s)]
*  and I was like, you know, I think there's something, it was a casual, and it was like mint and something else. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=212.0s)]
*  It was one of those more like ones somebody made in the woods or made at their house. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=218.0s)]
*  And I was like, I like this a little. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=223.0s)]
*  Organic style? Not like a typical Axe chocolate or like Old Spice Swagger, [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=225.0s)]
*  or any of those like super heavy chemical ones. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=230.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's the ones that started getting scary. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=233.0s)]
*  I used to collect all that shit, all the Axe flavors. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=235.0s)]
*  You did? [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=238.0s)]
*  Yeah, when I was a kid. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=239.0s)]
*  Dude, they had, why did you collect it? [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=240.0s)]
*  I think I was a victim of the Axe marketing. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=242.0s)]
*  Like they had the Axe chocolate commercial, it was like he walks out of the house, [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=244.0s)]
*  and all the ladies are just like all over him, and I was like, that's going to be me, dude. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=247.0s)]
*  I was in seventh grade, I was like, just got to keep stacking up Axe deodorant flavors and see which one works for me. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=250.0s)]
*  Yeah, boy, you get them Axes, boy, you get as much fucking deodorant as you can. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=256.0s)]
*  Yeah, I remember something like that, dude, being young, and they had this fella in our class named Michael, [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=260.0s)]
*  and people used to beat him up a lot, and his dad could fix computers or whatever. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=266.0s)]
*  And where I was from, if somebody could fix computers, it was almost like they worked for Satan. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=271.0s)]
*  People didn't want that, can you fix a fucking truck, boy, you know what I'm saying? [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=275.0s)]
*  Get out of here with your damn wires. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=281.0s)]
*  And he, I think, felt like deodorant would give him power, and I remember he would put it on his whole body. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=283.0s)]
*  Really? [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=290.0s)]
*  Put it up and down his limbs and everything, yeah. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=291.0s)]
*  And it really didn't help him much, it made him enjoyable to be around, kind of. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=293.0s)]
*  But I don't think it helped him in the emotional sense that he was looking for, for a parent, you know? [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=299.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=304.0s)]
*  Because he would put that Old Spice the Splash stuff on. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=305.0s)]
*  Just all over his entire body? [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=307.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=309.0s)]
*  Like on the front of his hands? [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=310.0s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=311.0s)]
*  His face too? [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=312.0s)]
*  I'm not sure how much he did on that young skin, it would probably really burn him. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=313.0s)]
*  I'm sure he smelled great. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=316.0s)]
*  Oh, dude, he was, but I think what he was looking for, he was like, if I get enough, maybe this positive smell, maybe my father will love me. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=317.0s)]
*  So you said that a computer programmer is the least honorable profession where you grew up in Louisiana? [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=323.0s)]
*  At the time it was. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=328.0s)]
*  What do you think at that time was like the most respectable line of work? [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=329.0s)]
*  Probably tire care. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=337.0s)]
*  Yeah, fixing them, patching them up. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=338.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=341.0s)]
*  You could roll in there and roll out in about 12, 13 minutes, you know? [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=342.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=345.0s)]
*  Is this before discount tire kind of like took the mom and pop tire spots out of business? [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=346.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=349.0s)]
*  Back in the good old days. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=350.0s)]
*  Yeah, back when you rolled in there and a guy could, he would, a guy would, he wouldn't even have to, he'd smell around the tire and know what was up. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=351.0s)]
*  I love tire shops. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=358.0s)]
*  Oh, dude, they were so good that one of the guys tried to make love to my mother for a while and I think that also made me think, oh, these guys are heroes. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=359.0s)]
*  Yeah, why? [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=366.0s)]
*  Because it was somebody that cared about my mom, I guess, you know? [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=367.0s)]
*  It was like, oh man, these guys, they could change the tire on your life, you know? [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=370.0s)]
*  Yeah, they're heroic for sure. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=375.0s)]
*  About being like, you know, someone that loves you. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=376.0s)]
*  But anyway, man, Andrew Calan, thanks for being here, bro. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=379.0s)]
*  Thanks, man. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=383.0s)]
*  So some of my audience might not know you, right? [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=384.0s)]
*  You are certainly like, you are a wizard in your own and in a very huge world of journalism, but in your own world. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=386.0s)]
*  Like, take me through a little bit of where you started out. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=395.0s)]
*  So Andrew's kind of like this, I'm labeled like this Hunter S. Thompson, kind of like this, you know, this like, you're a journalist. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=398.0s)]
*  That's a safe statement. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=408.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=409.0s)]
*  You told me one time when I met you, you said, I follow the vibe or the heat. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=410.0s)]
*  I follow where the energy's at. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=414.0s)]
*  Yeah, definitely. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=416.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=417.0s)]
*  And so you're like a seeker, kind of. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=418.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=420.0s)]
*  Where do you kind of start at? [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=421.0s)]
*  I first saw you on French Quarter Confessions because I'm from Louisiana. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=423.0s)]
*  That was my first video project. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=427.0s)]
*  I was a doorman on Bourbon Street in the quarter and I would get off work and like interview drunk people for late night confessionals, [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=429.0s)]
*  like when they were out partying on Bourbon and Royal and any surrounding streets, sometimes on Frenchmen. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=435.0s)]
*  Sometimes you got a little crazy. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=440.0s)]
*  But I mean, I started I read from my high school newspaper and then like I had this cool ass high school teacher. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=441.0s)]
*  I didn't really like school too much, but I had a journalism class and this teacher, Calvin, would let me like leave school for the whole day. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=447.0s)]
*  And I would come back at the end of the day, like before the bell rang at like 325. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=454.0s)]
*  And he said, if you had a story of a cool person that you talk to or someone interesting out there, I'd give you school credit. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=457.0s)]
*  So I was able to just roam Seattle like free roam throughout the day. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=464.0s)]
*  And I would come back with like stories about jugalos that I would meet downtown. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=468.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=472.0s)]
*  You know, like how to buy some shit off the Silk Road. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=473.0s)]
*  I would go to the Occupy Movement tent city and interview people there and just come back and just like write a little article or write up. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=476.0s)]
*  And I got school credit. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=482.0s)]
*  And then he helped me. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=483.0s)]
*  That kind of experience like propelled me to go to college in Louisiana on a full scholarship to Loyola. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=484.0s)]
*  Oh, wow. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=490.0s)]
*  So they gave you that's where you went down there. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=491.0s)]
*  Loyola. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=492.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=493.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=494.0s)]
*  You know about the Wolfpack? [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=495.0s)]
*  Dude, I went to Loyola for one semester. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=496.0s)]
*  No, you didn't. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=497.0s)]
*  Yeah, dude. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=498.0s)]
*  You live in Beaver Hall in the dorms? [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=499.0s)]
*  No, I tried to do cocaine with a girl one time and I couldn't get an erection. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=500.0s)]
*  And I and I have always felt horrible about that. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=503.0s)]
*  That one experience is the reason you dropped out of college. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=506.0s)]
*  It made me I think leave. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=508.0s)]
*  I was like, because it was a small campus. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=509.0s)]
*  I didn't want to see her. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=514.0s)]
*  Oh, that's a small campus. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=515.0s)]
*  You know, you see every student every day at Loyola. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=516.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=520.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=521.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=522.0s)]
*  There's no like there's no place to hide over there. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=523.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=524.0s)]
*  And if you go to the boot or the palms or like Snake and Jake's or one of those like college bars, you really see the same people every day. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=525.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=530.0s)]
*  And somebody usually I feel like there's a sex crime there every night like it almost like sex crimes Sunday. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=531.0s)]
*  You know, it should be like a thing. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=536.0s)]
*  For sure. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=537.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=538.0s)]
*  Like a game of Clue. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=539.0s)]
*  They kind of like give you like a little check off sheet. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=540.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=541.0s)]
*  Those particular bars like on the corner of like Broadway and Zimple are a fucking nightmare. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=542.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=547.0s)]
*  People are peeing and drinking at the same time. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=548.0s)]
*  Like it's a real. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=549.0s)]
*  Peeing and fighting and making out and grinding, which I didn't really know continued into adulthood. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=550.0s)]
*  I thought grinding was like a middle school sort of like, you know, like it's like but at the boot like right now there's someone at the boot grinding with a stranger with their eyes closed. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=555.0s)]
*  Just fucking like the song Candy Shop is playing and they're just like straight up vibing it out, making out. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=565.0s)]
*  Why is that? [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=571.0s)]
*  Why is there something about and that's I think a little that is that dirty Louisiana thing where it's like, let's just get together and let our fucking oysters touch. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=572.0s)]
*  You know, there's something about that. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=581.0s)]
*  I mean, I didn't know because I did some grinding my freshman year at Loyola, you know, because everyone else is grinding and I didn't know at that time, but that would be the last time I'd ever grind. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=583.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=590.0s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=591.0s)]
*  I wouldn't have believed you if you told me at that time, but it was in the boot and I was like, this is fucking weird and it never happened again. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=592.0s)]
*  I wonder if it'd be like a good grinding championship. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=600.0s)]
*  That would see something that would be something I could see going to interview. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=602.0s)]
*  I think Jamaica would win. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=605.0s)]
*  Have you seen the dagger dancing? [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=606.0s)]
*  Uh-uh. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=607.0s)]
*  They're like jumping up and down and trying to like dramatic air humping. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=608.0s)]
*  Like you have to look it up. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=611.0s)]
*  I'll send you some videos. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=613.0s)]
*  It sounds like some of the Maasai warrior stuff. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=614.0s)]
*  Is it like that? [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=616.0s)]
*  Like when those got like they do a lot of that. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=617.0s)]
*  It's just like that. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=619.0s)]
*  Oh, wow. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=620.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=621.0s)]
*  Okay. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=622.0s)]
*  So you came through French quarter confessions. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=623.0s)]
*  That's where a lot of people, I think that's where I first heard about you from being from Louisiana. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=625.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=628.0s)]
*  And did you miss that? [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=629.0s)]
*  Do you miss that Louisiana energy kind of so much, man? [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=631.0s)]
*  I think about it all the time. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=633.0s)]
*  Like when I dream, it's like they all take place in the streets of like New Orleans. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=634.0s)]
*  Like it's like my mental map. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=638.0s)]
*  You know what I'm talking about? [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=640.0s)]
*  It's a special place. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=641.0s)]
*  Once you connect to it, it like never leaves you. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=642.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=644.0s)]
*  You know, but it's also hard to find work out there. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=645.0s)]
*  Like it's hard to build a career in media out there. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=647.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=650.0s)]
*  I think it's really, really hard. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=651.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=652.0s)]
*  Like there's like the news channels and then there's like crime. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=653.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=657.0s)]
*  Or you play for the Saints. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=658.0s)]
*  I feel like there's not a lot of avenues to build a name for yourself. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=659.0s)]
*  For sure. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=663.0s)]
*  I mean, the one time I tried to get involved in like local TV stations in Louisiana, I had to sign an NDA. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=664.0s)]
*  And they're like, we're not going to tell you what your assignment is, but just sign this and we're going to get you on TV. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=670.0s)]
*  And I'm like, all right, cool. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=675.0s)]
*  So I sign it and they send me in like a Sprinter van to Covington, Louisiana. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=676.0s)]
*  And they're like, you see this woman, her house just burnt down. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=681.0s)]
*  She doesn't know this yet, but her two dogs are dead inside the house. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=684.0s)]
*  You got to go walk in that house with her and write about it. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=688.0s)]
*  I was like, this is the worst job ever. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=692.0s)]
*  It was like maybe the gender reveal. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=694.0s)]
*  I'm a bit of not like that. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=696.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=697.0s)]
*  It was the saddest thing I've ever seen. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=698.0s)]
*  And so I was like, I don't want to do this. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=699.0s)]
*  But after quarter confessions, like I would hitchhike around the US a lot by myself. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=701.0s)]
*  Oh, you did. So you got so after that, then you made it into hitchhiking. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=706.0s)]
*  Yeah, pretty much like right around there too. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=709.0s)]
*  So I would hitchhike from like Seattle to New Orleans and back and just interview like outlaws, runaways, deadbeats, like crazy motel creatures in like Nevada, you know, the real reptilians. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=711.0s)]
*  Oh yeah, man. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=721.0s)]
*  Look, I've done a lot of picking up hitchhikers over my day. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=722.0s)]
*  Oh, cool. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=725.0s)]
*  I mean, the worst one I ever had was a guy, not the worst, really the best also. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=726.0s)]
*  This guy, what did he say? [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=731.0s)]
*  Oh, he goes, you want a cold beer? [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=734.0s)]
*  And I'm like, there's no fuck way this dude has a cold beer on him. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=735.0s)]
*  Pulled a cold beer out of his jacket, man. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=737.0s)]
*  Like, I don't know if he'd been cooling with his heart or just whatever he had, you know? [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=739.0s)]
*  And he pulled a cold beer out of his jacket. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=743.0s)]
*  And I was like, oh, this dude is a real, some type of like a future baby or some type of wizard or something. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=745.0s)]
*  And then he told me a story one time, he got picked up by a guy one time and it was in a high, the guy ended up being in a high speed chase from the police. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=752.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=761.0s)]
*  So next, you know, this hitchhikers in a high speed chase. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=762.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=765.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=766.0s)]
*  And so he's like, he asked the guys like, why'd you pick me up? [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=767.0s)]
*  And he goes, cause I don't want to die alone. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=768.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=770.0s)]
*  Let me break for one second. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=774.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=776.0s)]
*  Gotta get some phlegm out real quick. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=777.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=779.0s)]
*  Get it out, man. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=780.0s)]
*  We'll sell it actually. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=781.0s)]
*  Okay. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=784.0s)]
*  So you get into the hitchhiking, taking on some of your hitchhiking journey right there. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=785.0s)]
*  I mean, just, just everything was so ridiculous. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=787.0s)]
*  Like every ride was like crazier than the last. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=791.0s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=793.0s)]
*  Like, there's always that one story that I tell about like tiny like 100 and dude picking me up in Crowley, Louisiana and like taking me to like a refurbished barnhouse. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=794.0s)]
*  So that like 12 confessional booths. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=803.0s)]
*  And I didn't know that it was like a porn viewing. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=805.0s)]
*  Have you been to a place like this? [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=808.0s)]
*  Was it like a, uh, people kind of a gay meetup or just gay or straight? [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=809.0s)]
*  I think it's a place where truckers pull over to like have a private pornography viewing experience. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=814.0s)]
*  They have like a bottle of lotion and like they have three channels. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=819.0s)]
*  They have like the gay channel, regular channel, then like the fetish channel or whatever. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=822.0s)]
*  So I'm thinking I picked this dude up. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=826.0s)]
*  He has like a fucked up car and he takes me to the place to view it. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=828.0s)]
*  Try to see, you know, see what was up. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=832.0s)]
*  And I was like, no. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=835.0s)]
*  And then he was like, oh, why were you at that truck stop? [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=837.0s)]
*  And I guess where he picked me up was like a known kind of notorious Bay for notorious, notorious gay prostitute truck stop. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=839.0s)]
*  So he thought that I was a I wonder why he didn't say anything for an hour in the car. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=847.0s)]
*  But he didn't want to get like get a solicitation charge. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=851.0s)]
*  So he didn't say much because he kind of figured I let it out. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=853.0s)]
*  He wanted he was asking me weird questions like, do you like porn? [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=856.0s)]
*  Do you like movies? [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=858.0s)]
*  And I was like, right. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=859.0s)]
*  This guy. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=860.0s)]
*  Right. Yeah. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=861.0s)]
*  Do you like him? [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=862.0s)]
*  Yeah. What kind of condiments do you like? [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=863.0s)]
*  Yeah. Just like strange shit like that. Super, super weird. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=865.0s)]
*  Yeah. But I wrote a book about the hitchhiking like a zine thing. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=868.0s)]
*  You did? Yeah. And like people liked it. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=871.0s)]
*  I probably sold a couple hundred copies. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=873.0s)]
*  Like that was good. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=874.0s)]
*  But then I realized like nobody really reads, dude. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=875.0s)]
*  Yeah. Reading is a tough thing for people. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=877.0s)]
*  Do you even find for yourself that it's hard to read these days? [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=880.0s)]
*  I'd prefer to listen to a podcast or an audiobook, you know, but it is like a calming like thing to do. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=883.0s)]
*  Reading. Yeah. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=888.0s)]
*  I think it makes my mind does something good for my brain. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=890.0s)]
*  I feel like in my mind it makes them kind of settle down. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=892.0s)]
*  It puts them like on a pace that feels like they can keep up with. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=895.0s)]
*  Yeah. Whereas like this, the way we kind of have media nowadays, sometimes it feels like a pace that's not fair to the operating system that I have, you know, that God put in me or whatever. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=898.0s)]
*  Any hotties ever pick you up? Any chicks ever pick you up? [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=910.0s)]
*  Was there ever any sex on the route? [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=913.0s)]
*  No. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=915.0s)]
*  Wow. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=916.0s)]
*  Definitely not. It was mostly like a super old timey like stick and stick and Mendel kind of like formerly vagabond hobo dudes. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=917.0s)]
*  You know, because I think that like they they grew up before Texas Chainsaw Massacre came out, which to me is the quintessential turning point of hitchhikers being viewed as like potentially homicidal maniacs. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=926.0s)]
*  But before that, I'm assuming it was a cool fucking hippie thing to do. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=936.0s)]
*  You know, but then after that, it was like hitchhiker is a is a murderer. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=939.0s)]
*  Yeah. And so I think now like people would flip me off, you know, like good. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=943.0s)]
*  And we're talking like Christian family folk would be driving in a minivan. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=947.0s)]
*  Look at me and the whole family would flip me off. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=950.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah. Yeah. Just strange. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=953.0s)]
*  Look at that. Yeah. Yeah. They used to call. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=955.0s)]
*  Yeah, I remember. Yeah. People sometimes drive by. Call me a road inward. They would call me like, what? What do you even talk about? [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=958.0s)]
*  Wow. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=965.0s)]
*  Just like what? [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=966.0s)]
*  So you did some hitchhiking too? [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=967.0s)]
*  Yeah, man. I used to get out there, bro. I used to love it. I used to love. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=968.0s)]
*  You know what I think I loved? [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=972.0s)]
*  I think I did it because it was a part of me that wanted to have something different, you know? [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=974.0s)]
*  Yeah. But then there was that moment of fear where it's like, I don't know what the hell is going to happen to me. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=979.0s)]
*  Yeah. I think I always liked that, you know, gamble. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=984.0s)]
*  Like one dude that picked us up in Arizona drove me from Phoenix to Vegas. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=988.0s)]
*  He was like basically an arms dealer. You know, he had just spent the better part of 10 years like in Arizona State Penitentiary and his whole backseat had like Home Depot buckets just full of like magazines, switches, silencers, beams, all this crazy ass shit. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=992.0s)]
*  And was it hard to navigate that? Is it hard to stay in the pocket in there and not just like jump out or? [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=1012.0s)]
*  Well, because you know, one thing you learn from being a hitchhiker is people lie a lot. They try to impress you. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=1016.0s)]
*  They try to relate to you and they want to seem super cool and like weathered. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=1021.0s)]
*  So they would tell you like, man, I used to be selling guns all up and down the West Coast. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=1024.0s)]
*  You're like, OK, you know, we hear you. Right. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=1028.0s)]
*  And he was like, no, for real, check out the back. And I look at these buckets full of like gun parts and I'm like, why the fuck did this guy pick me up? [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=1030.0s)]
*  He's already running hot, riding hot as hell. Right. But I guess he probably enjoyed the role of the dice too. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=1037.0s)]
*  Oh, right. There's two people are rolling the dice. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=1043.0s)]
*  And it's also like saying, hey, God, I'm going to put the dice or fates or whatever. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=1046.0s)]
*  I'm going to put the dice in your hands. Exactly. I'm going to let I'm going to take it. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=1050.0s)]
*  I am going to like, yeah, I'm going to take my hands off the wheel. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=1054.0s)]
*  Yeah, dude, a lot of times I would let people just or I would get picked up or have people take me just even around our own town, you know. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=1057.0s)]
*  And it was definitely, yeah, there's that element of uncertainty. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=1064.0s)]
*  What's going to happen here? You know? [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=1068.0s)]
*  You know, and also it takes some of the responsibility of your own life off of you. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=1070.0s)]
*  You're like, I'm going to put my life in this guy's hands. This Mazda. Yeah. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=1074.0s)]
*  You know, this dude in a Mazda. With underglow. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=1078.0s)]
*  Damn, bro. Yeah. And hitchhiking used to be so popular in the 70s and stuff like that. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=1084.0s)]
*  Like 1978 or whatever. Texas Chainsaw Massacre drops when it happened. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=1089.0s)]
*  And then every year there was a hitchhiker horror movie of some hippie looking dude who slashes the driver's throat. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=1094.0s)]
*  It's horrible. But also in the South, I mean, hitchhiking is a lot harder than it is on the West Coast. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=1100.0s)]
*  You think so? I did the 101 one time, like from Astoria, Oregon down to like the Bay. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=1105.0s)]
*  I got picked up within 30 seconds every time by people in like Volkswagen vans and RVs, like, you know, West Coast kind of like hippie adjacent folk in the South. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=1110.0s)]
*  I feel like it's more of a charity thing. Like when I remember I got picked up in Paducah, Kentucky one time, which is like the most religious small town I've ever been to. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=1120.0s)]
*  And everyone who picked me up was like, you remind me of my son. I'm like, what do you mean? [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=1127.0s)]
*  They're like, he's strung out on dope somewhere. And I'm like, OK, I'm not. But like, thank you. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=1131.0s)]
*  So I think it's just a different barometer for you. Remind me of my hot daughter in that area. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=1137.0s)]
*  You would probably compete with some of the local models. I think so, too. I could model in Paducah. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=1142.0s)]
*  If all else fails, I can just go model in the Appalachia. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=1148.0s)]
*  Yeah, that'd be so good. [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=1151.0s)]
*  Got to get stronger hands, you know, if I get like farmer fingers. [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=1153.0s)]
*  Bro, how pissed would they get if like a trans model showed up and started winning all the pageants? [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=1157.0s)]
*  Oh, dude, culture war 2.0. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=1162.0s)]
*  That'd be so good. [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=1164.0s)]
*  The culture war has been back on. You've been watching the news? [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=1165.0s)]
*  Yeah, I think I see a lot of it. So when you say culture war, what does it mean? [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=1168.0s)]
*  Means when mainstream media propagates like irrelevant small culture war shit, you know, like things that aren't really a big issue, like, you know, like trans women playing in sports and they obsess over it to distract you from real things that are going on. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=1171.0s)]
*  Do you think that they do that? [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=1185.0s)]
*  Yeah, they totally do it. Like left, like liberal and like conservative mainstream media, they pick strategically like before midterms to get people all riled up by like zooming in on like specific. They know what they're doing. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=1187.0s)]
*  Yeah, like people with lists like they're, you know, or like, you know, like trans people in sports. [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=1199.0s)]
*  Yeah, it doesn't just make you angry. [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=1205.0s)]
*  Like you didn't hear about it for like eight months and then they're like, oh shit, we got an election coming up. Let's stoke more anxiety and exploit people's fears about this. [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=1207.0s)]
*  Try to get votes. [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=1214.0s)]
*  And it works, huh? [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=1215.0s)]
*  Instantly. [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=1216.0s)]
*  On both sides. [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=1217.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=1219.0s)]
*  Yeah, it works instantly on both sides. [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=1220.0s)]
*  It's amazing sometimes because people look at the conservative side. [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=1222.0s)]
*  I feel like this is just a general thought of mine. [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=1227.0s)]
*  People look at the conservative side as being a less educated side, but both sides will fall for the same exact tricks. [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=1230.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=1238.0s)]
*  It's almost crazy. You can almost, I don't know. It's just really fascinating to me that it's like, but you, this is the same game being done on both on both teams. [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=1239.0s)]
*  Oh yeah, totally. [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=1249.0s)]
*  Like liberal media will go to like the furthest sticks and boonies they can, they can possibly go to to find like their like racist guy to interview. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=1250.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=1258.0s)]
*  And just to get people all freaked out. And I'm sure you know what that's like. They often scapegoat the South. [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=1259.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's happened a lot. It's happened a lot over the years, especially during like during Trump, during like that administration, during that kind of stuff. [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=1264.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=1271.0s)]
*  Those white guys in Charlestown or whatever like Charlottesville. [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=1272.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=1275.0s)]
*  I thought it was surely like there's probably a couple of dudes in there who was hoping things would go to another level of like, let's whiten around. [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=1276.0s)]
*  But I think there was probably as many people that were just confused and responded to a Craigslist ad, you know. [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=1285.0s)]
*  Yeah, for sure. And just falling victim to their own echo chamber, you know, like they're in these tight, weird online niche communities and the algorithm starts recommending shit to them that they already know they're going to be receptive to, to get more ad revenue. [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=1291.0s)]
*  And before you know it, they're just like down the rabbit hole. And these social media companies are making fucking millions while these people are just spiraling out of control. [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=1302.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=1309.0s)]
*  The next thing you know, they're yelling shit about Jews in public. I mean, that's crazy, dude. You know, I don't yell anything in public. [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=1310.0s)]
*  Yeah. Michael Myers is pretty, I don't honestly, brought a dude not that scary anymore. I saw the last Halloween. It was horrible. The one few years ago was horrible. [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=1315.0s)]
*  I can't imagine how bad this one is. But if you look at him, he looks like the kind of dude that tightens his body up because he's got that whacker on him, bro. [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=1324.0s)]
*  He's got that, he's got that tremor, baby, that that he got a damn machete, doesn't he? [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=1336.0s)]

*  You know, one time I remember we got stuck somewhere in the mud and people said, well, dang, we got to get out the mud. [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=1396.0s)]
*  And I said, well, this is a four-cylinder. This is a Ford Escort. And we don't stand a chance against the mud. [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=1403.0s)]

*  Our voices now have to go through these certain portals or it feels like that they can't be communicated. [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=1468.0s)]
*  Yeah, there's no more like town crier. I mean, no one would take you seriously. [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=1474.0s)]
*  Right. That's the thing. No one would take you seriously. [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=1478.0s)]
*  But I seek out people like that. That's sort of the basis of early All Gas No Breaks interviews is like I don't want to talk to an online loud person. [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=1480.0s)]
*  I want to talk to a real life screamer. [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=1488.0s)]
*  Yeah. So you get so yeah, get me to All Gas No Breaks and then let's get to Channel 5. [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=1490.0s)]
*  So and then just for our listeners, so you're doing the hitchhiking, you left out of Louisiana and you end up? [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=1495.0s)]
*  In Seattle. [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=1504.0s)]
*  In Seattle. [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=1505.0s)]
*  And then from Seattle like down to LA on the West Coast and back to Colorado. [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=1506.0s)]
*  I mean, the summers following that I hitchhiked a bunch, but the book that I wrote, it's not for sale anymore, but it was about like my first hitchhiking experience. [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=1509.0s)]
*  That kind of had like a small cult following, which led me to want to make a show. [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=1517.0s)]
*  The book was called All Gas No Breaks, a hitchhiker's diary. [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=1520.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=1522.0s)]
*  And I was like, man, nobody really reads. I want to make like an interview based road show. [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=1523.0s)]
*  So I convinced a company to buy me an RV, whatever made All Gas No Breaks, fell out with the company over a contractual dispute, signed a movie deal with Tim and Eric. [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=1527.0s)]
*  That movie is coming out in December. [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=1536.0s)]
*  Awesome. [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=1539.0s)]
*  It's with HBO and H24. [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=1540.0s)]
*  Congratulations. [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=1541.0s)]

*  Wow. [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=1543.0s)]

*  So the movie will be about, I know you have a tour coming up too, right? [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=1545.0s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. So, I mean, that's crazy, man. I start my first ever tour in like 12 days. [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=1548.0s)]
*  It's like 45 dates, like back to back. We're going to screen scenes from the movie. [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=1553.0s)]
*  We're going to find like battle rappers and magicians via Craigslist to open up each performance. [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=1557.0s)]
*  You can have some people from episodes I know that you've already taped that will be at some of the venues. [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=1562.0s)]
*  Yeah, definitely. And it's just crazy. I've just been like trying to be calm before the tour starts. [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=1568.0s)]
*  I've just been playing tennis and hanging out with my mom every day. [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=1573.0s)]
*  Oh, wow. [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=1575.0s)]
*  Yeah. At Venice Beach tennis courts. [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=1576.0s)]
*  Do you and your mother look alike or no? [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=1578.0s)]
*  Yeah, for sure. [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=1580.0s)]
*  Y'all do? [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=1581.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=1582.0s)]
*  That's cool. [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=1583.0s)]
*  I think so. Yeah. Yeah. [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=1584.0s)]
*  Is your father still alive or no? [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=1585.0s)]
*  Yeah, he's alive. He's a bartender in Seattle. [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=1586.0s)]
*  Oh, he is? [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=1588.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=1589.0s)]
*  Oh, wow. He's a cool dude. [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=1590.0s)]
*  Are your parents pretty proud of you? [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=1591.0s)]
*  Yeah, I think so. I hope so. [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=1592.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=1593.0s)]
*  They should be, I think. [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=1594.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=1595.0s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=1596.0s)]
*  Do you feel like your desire to create or to get out there and interview people, do you feel like any of that came from your own childhood or do you think that's what you want to do? [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=1597.0s)]
*  Do you feel like any of that came from your own childhood or do you think it was just a choice you kind of made? [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=1602.0s)]
*  Is it more about journalism or is it more about seeking something to fulfill something inside of you? [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=1605.0s)]
*  Well, I think my mom is a super sweet, caring person, very empathetic, big listener. [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=1611.0s)]
*  She was the kind of person that if someone would approach us on the street, I need some help, she would always help them. [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=1615.0s)]
*  But a step further, talk to them and converse with them. [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=1621.0s)]
*  I was super young. [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=1624.0s)]
*  She would humanize people just day to day for me. [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=1625.0s)]
*  So I didn't go I didn't grow up with this wall or like glass wall between me and like people who I didn't understand. [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=1628.0s)]
*  So I just kind of went through life. [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=1633.0s)]
*  And then like when I started smoking weed when I was like 13 in Seattle, like walking around downtown high, I just became like this like a toddler level curious like wanderer. [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=1634.0s)]
*  And I would just walk around like, what's up? [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=1643.0s)]
*  Where are you from? [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=1645.0s)]
*  What's the craziest thing you've ever seen? [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=1646.0s)]
*  I was young. What's the craziest thing I've ever seen? [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=1649.0s)]
*  I would just sit there for like an hour and be like, damn, dude. [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=1651.0s)]
*  All right, peace. [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=1653.0s)]
*  So I was like listening to basically five hours of free podcasts today. [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=1654.0s)]
*  And so by the time I got old, I was like, then you can make a career out of this. [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=1658.0s)]
*  That's sick. [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=1661.0s)]
*  Wow. [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=1662.0s)]
*  That's incredible, man. [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=1663.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=1664.0s)]
*  Seattle's got Seattle at night gets really it's got to like a damp vampires. [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=1665.0s)]
*  But there's a lot of like there's a lot of damn condensation fucking drug muppets bouncing around over there. [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=1670.0s)]
*  Certainly so. [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=1677.0s)]
*  That's a beautiful American city. [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=1678.0s)]
*  Yeah, we used to do that comedy club underground comedy over there. [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=1680.0s)]
*  Yeah, it was it was honestly one of the best rooms to do comedy in. [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=1686.0s)]
*  I'm not that still there. [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=1689.0s)]
*  So now so that's where you're at now. [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=1690.0s)]
*  So now you got like I mean you do so much interesting stuff now you follow. [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=1695.0s)]
*  Is that still kind of your goal to follow the heat to follow what's going on? [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=1699.0s)]
*  How hard is it to still do that when you've gotten busier? [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=1704.0s)]
*  I'm not I mean right now there's not much happening in the news cycle. [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=1707.0s)]
*  So it's like I'm more doing like character studies and like random cultural interest stuff. [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=1711.0s)]
*  But like once the midterms kick back into full swing, like I got to follow the newsbeat. [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=1715.0s)]
*  Like there's nothing better than like being on the ball of news as it's happening. [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=1719.0s)]
*  Like it's just it's like the best feeling. [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=1722.0s)]
*  It's like it's kind of like addicting. [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=1724.0s)]
*  Wow. [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=1725.0s)]
*  Like watching history unfold and documenting it and being like on scene. [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=1726.0s)]
*  I get how reporters can get addicted to like following that high all the time. [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=1729.0s)]
*  But you got to like stay away from that to a certain degree because then you become just like a chaos tourist. [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=1733.0s)]
*  And you spend every waking day being like where are people pissed off? [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=1738.0s)]
*  And you get so used to it's kind of jades your mind and you're like man like society is in decline because you spend every other day at like a right or left wing protest. [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=1741.0s)]
*  So it's important to kind of zoom out and cover like positive subjects. [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=1749.0s)]
*  Like I went to a powerlifting event in Sacramento a month ago called World's Strongest Man. [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=1752.0s)]
*  That was just fun. [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=1757.0s)]
*  No one's talking about like you know the Clinton Deep State Cabal or like the collapse of civilization. [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=1759.0s)]
*  So I'm like man this is just nice. [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=1764.0s)]
*  So you got to pepper your life with shit like that to stay level headed I think. [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=1766.0s)]
*  Interesting. [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=1770.0s)]
*  Yeah I saw you talking a bunch of like those Jizz Wizard dudes. [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=1771.0s)]
*  Those like guys are like those fucking you know what I'm saying those fuck garglers dude. [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=1775.0s)]
*  Them dudes go deep bro. [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=1780.0s)]
*  Yeah Will Blunderfield. [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=1782.0s)]
*  This is his name. [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=1783.0s)]
*  Oh okay Will. [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=1784.0s)]
*  He's kind of the commander in chief of the Jizz Wizards. [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=1785.0s)]
*  And that's a new movement really of men. [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=1788.0s)]
*  Did you see that just as a why like an out there group or do you see that as an example of men trying to find different ways to regain masculinity? [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=1791.0s)]
*  I think that Will's specific demographic is dudes who would be traditionally called gay by society. [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=1800.0s)]
*  Okay. [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=1807.0s)]
*  Trying to become bisexual to a certain extent. [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=1808.0s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=1811.0s)]
*  Because he's talking about how you know when he does same sex erotic bonding in the forest with his bros it kind of makes him have a procreative urge. [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=1812.0s)]
*  You know so I think to a certain degree I think the manosphere has definitely taken over like a lot of the surface net even. [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=1820.0s)]
*  What is a manosphere? [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=1828.0s)]
*  Just like Andrew Tate type people you know just like men's like alpha men's wellness self help dudes you know. [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=1829.0s)]
*  But I think that Will's a bit different because it's more on like the spiritual side and it's more connected to like eating well and all that type of shit. [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=1837.0s)]
*  Cutting like glyphosate and natriazine out of your diet to like have your chakras align and like reach the new dimension and like breath work. [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=1846.0s)]
*  And I feel like he I feel like he's more on that too. [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=1855.0s)]
*  But then again I feel like 2020 and COVID created this insane fusion with like the wellness community and like pretty hard right people because of the anti-vax thing. [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=1858.0s)]
*  Oh interesting. [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=1869.0s)]
*  So like half of the you know like yogis and like holistic community wellness people became like fully QAnon-pilled in 2020. [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=1871.0s)]
*  Wow. [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=1879.0s)]
*  Like I remember I'm not going to say her name but the this lady who invented butthole sunning or perineum sunning. [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=1880.0s)]
*  Yeah I've heard a lot about that. [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=1885.0s)]
*  Yeah so she it was super like kind of cool hippie like free thinker believes in the sun god thinks the sun god speaks to your soul through your anus rays come in get into your body. [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=1887.0s)]
*  That's got divine energy. [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=1898.0s)]
*  I hadn't talked to her in like six months. [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=1900.0s)]
*  I checked back on her Instagram and it's a this is real shit. [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=1902.0s)]
*  It's George Floyd and then like a lizard person cropped over each other. [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=1906.0s)]
*  And she was like don't believe everything you see on TV and like it's just crazy to see like that happening to someone like that. [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=1912.0s)]
*  And now it's all just like the storm is coming like crazy ass like fringe shit like JFK Jr. is still alive. [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=1919.0s)]
*  Oh wow. [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=1927.0s)]
*  Like yeah. [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=1929.0s)]
*  JFK Jr. [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=1931.0s)]
*  No he's no he's not. [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=1932.0s)]
*  But his him being alive is central to the QAnon. [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=1934.0s)]
*  Oh I see I see that you're saying that it gets in that little that drain. [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=1936.0s)]
*  They were waiting at the grassy knoll in Dallas like four months ago for his return. [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=1941.0s)]
*  No way. [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=1944.0s)]
*  Yeah and like it's kind of like Bigfoot hunting style where like one guy says that he saw it when everyone looked away. [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=1945.0s)]
*  So I met a guy who was like I saw him and everyone's like no you didn't like and they almost were having some infighting. [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=1950.0s)]
*  He's like no dude I saw him. [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=1955.0s)]
*  So you were down there when that happened. [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=1957.0s)]
*  No but I talked to a bunch of the people who were there at the People's Convoy which is like a trucker protest right after. [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=1958.0s)]
*  Okay. [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=1963.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=1964.0s)]
*  Wow. [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=1965.0s)]
*  I'm pretty deep in that little world. [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=1966.0s)]
*  Yeah we've we've had Bobby Kennedy on here before. [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=1967.0s)]
*  So he was big. [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=1970.0s)]
*  He's an environmentalist. [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=1971.0s)]
*  You know so it's it makes sense that he would be you know he was always about like taking care of nature. [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=1973.0s)]
*  So then it makes sense that he would take want to take that his interest would lead to taking care of the nature inside of your body. [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=1979.0s)]
*  You know like the waterways inside of your body and that sort of thing. [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=1985.0s)]
*  So he's been a big like I wouldn't call him an aunt. [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=1989.0s)]
*  I don't think he's anti he wasn't anti-COVID but I think he was an anti-vax anti or making sure that vaccinations are tested correctly. [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=1994.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=2001.0s)]
*  Because in my town I grew up in Covington Louisiana and they had they used to they were making the polio vaccine in our town in like the 60s or something whenever they put it out or maybe the I think the 60s or 70s. [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=2002.0s)]
*  And they that's where they created the polio vaccine at and they used to test it on monkeys. [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=2018.0s)]
*  Well the polio vaccine ended up giving cervical cancer to millions of women but they'd already made it and they were just like yeah fuck it we already bought it right. [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=2023.0s)]
*  We are the deal sealed. [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=2034.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=2036.0s)]
*  So it helped polio but you there was a high risk for cervical cancer. [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=2037.0s)]
*  So I think some people you know it also depends on I think where some people's mindsets come out of. [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=2042.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=2046.0s)]
*  Do you do you now like it like I know you just went in and interviewed Alex Jones and I had to sit down with Alex Jones. [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=2047.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=2054.0s)]
*  What was that kind of like was that do you think the guy was absolutely crazy do you think he was overwhelmed by the lawsuit at this point. [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=2055.0s)]
*  Or do you feel like he's on point with some stuff and he's just too loud for the world these days like. [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=2066.0s)]
*  I don't know it's such a tough one because I do see both angles of it you know what I mean and I had a lot of heat from a lot of my fans for even talking to him. [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=2073.0s)]
*  I mean the billion dollar verdict it's he probably has between two and three million dollars in info wars or free speech systems is filing for bankruptcy. [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=2082.0s)]
*  So he's not going to the Sandy Hook family's are going to see that money. [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=2091.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=2094.0s)]
*  But I guess it's a precedent in the future for it's like if you because he was really coming after the parents as well. [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=2095.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=2102.0s)]
*  You know like he put one of the parents addresses up. [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=2103.0s)]
*  I mean it's egregious. [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=2105.0s)]
*  I mean it's egregious when somebody go and I can't imagine when you go through something like that. [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=2106.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=2109.0s)]
*  And there's this voice that gets loud. [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=2110.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=2112.0s)]
*  But I'm reading this book called Sandy Hook by Elizabeth Elizabeth Williamson and like some of the dudes that Alex was like platforming on his shit. [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=2113.0s)]
*  I hate saying platforming but like this dude Wolfgang Helbig and there's people who like were writing like 4000 emails a day to the Sandy Hook families like type shit like harassing them stalking them leaving messages saying they're going to kill them accusing them of keeping their kids alive as sex slaves in the attic and shit. [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=2119.0s)]
*  Horrible stuff. [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=2137.0s)]
*  So it wasn't a lot of people. [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=2138.0s)]
*  It's not just about Alex. [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=2140.0s)]
*  It's just somebody. [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=2142.0s)]
*  It's about the ripple effect. [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=2143.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=2144.0s)]
*  Because there's a whole community of lost people who devote their whole life to harassing the victims families of the Colorado Aurora shooting of Sandy Hook of you Valdi like it's a whole community of crisis actor followers like false flag. [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=2145.0s)]
*  Have you been able to meet any of those types of folks even just to see like because I think one thing that's really interesting that you do and I really like seeing it man is that you kind of just you go and just kind of listen to people. [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=2160.0s)]
*  It's like hey here's what's going on. [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=2171.0s)]
*  And I think it's really powerful even as you say like some of your followers or supporters like oh why would you even give this guy space. [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=2173.0s)]
*  But people would say that too about having Bobby Kennedy on here. [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=2180.0s)]
*  Why would you give this guy space like he's a human being is first of all one of the smartest guys that I know. [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=2184.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=2189.0s)]
*  Like really interesting and amazing friend. [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=2190.0s)]
*  So it's like I wouldn't not trust him like why wouldn't I listen and hear what his what his thoughts are and what's going on. [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=2192.0s)]
*  I just think that the more liberal audience is like super into deplatforming and they think that like giving someone a giving a problematic person a platform is somehow supporting them. [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=2199.0s)]
*  And I always refute that like this. [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=2211.0s)]
*  If I if it's a lesser known shitty person that I'm cherry picking to kind of dunk on that's fucked up. [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=2213.0s)]
*  You know if I'm if I bring some white nationalists from the you know cuts of Alabama on my show just to like grill him and make him look stupid. [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=2221.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=2228.0s)]
*  I am inadvertently growing his audience by bringing him on because the people who watch my shit and even if they agree with me his name is now out there. [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=2229.0s)]
*  I've elevated his name to the top and so people will know his name or go to his website. [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=2237.0s)]
*  You kind of increase traffic for that person right and you create future white nationalists and vice versa. [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=2241.0s)]
*  But like Alex Jones everybody knows who that is. [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=2246.0s)]
*  He's a household name. [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=2249.0s)]
*  The Proud Boys everybody knows who that is. [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=2250.0s)]
*  So when I'm interviewing people like that that most of my audience doesn't like I am not increasing their fame or increasing their exposure because with or without me everyone's going to know who those people are. [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=2252.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=2265.0s)]
*  Alex Jones is on the front page of the New York Times. [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=2266.0s)]
*  The Proud Boys are being investigated by the FBI for January 6. [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=2267.0s)]
*  So me interviewing them I'm not platforming or increasing their audience at all. [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=2270.0s)]
*  But you know if I was to interview like more lesser known you know fringe people I wouldn't do that you know. [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=2274.0s)]
*  Yeah like if you were to interview like whitey killer 1200 or you were to interview like slave buyer 55. [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=2281.0s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=2289.0s)]
*  Then you would be you know or yeah. [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=2290.0s)]
*  But mainstream media like liberal media does that shit. [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=2292.0s)]
*  They found like the dumbest person they can and they're like inside the Klu Klux Klan. [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=2295.0s)]
*  And it's and it's like some like 300 pound like CSI Miami watchers sitting in his chair is like white people we're just better at stuff. [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=2300.0s)]
*  And the journalist is like what do you mean by that. [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=2310.0s)]
*  How can you say something like that. [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=2316.0s)]
*  He was like you know I'm not doing that shit. [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=2317.0s)]
*  Yeah it's interesting. [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=2321.0s)]
*  And it's like people why do people get so stuck in their own. [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=2324.0s)]
*  Like why can't people just let somebody else have a different belief like like a different politician. [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=2328.0s)]
*  How did that get so crazy from your perception. [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=2335.0s)]
*  I don't know but I think that the politics like the how the late night TV shows and how SNL just became like orange man bashing machines. [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=2338.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=2347.0s)]
*  I think they can turn on Colbert or Jimmy Kimmel or something. [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=2348.0s)]
*  It's literally like every other night is like an anti-Trump monologue. [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=2350.0s)]
*  It was horrible. [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=2353.0s)]
*  They ruined their shows. [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=2354.0s)]
*  I think they're still doing it. [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=2355.0s)]
*  They're crazy though. [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=2357.0s)]
*  It seems like bad. [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=2358.0s)]
*  But why it's like you could just say hey this is who I support or don't support. [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=2359.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=2364.0s)]
*  I think the incentive is there. [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=2365.0s)]
*  It's the safest thing you can do. [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=2366.0s)]
*  You know in comedy in that realm is to just bash like you know a conservative president. [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=2368.0s)]
*  I don't support Trump you know but it's like I don't want to go on late night TV and watch a rich guy talk shit about another rich guy. [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=2374.0s)]
*  I know you know what I mean. [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=2381.0s)]
*  I'm just like this is just the same shit and I think that's something to do with it because if you think about it right like those shows reach everybody. [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=2382.0s)]
*  They're on cable so you can be sitting in the middle of a red state and you go on cable and you go to Comedy Central ABC late night and that's what you're seeing is you're supposed to hero being shit on by you know. [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=2390.0s)]
*  The comedic elite of late night TV in Los Angeles or New York. [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=2403.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=2407.0s)]
*  And that they're all on the same page. [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=2408.0s)]
*  None of them have any different view or not even a lot of like variation variation in their own views. [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=2409.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=2416.0s)]
*  But like the real OGs like Jon Stewart like they've held it down. [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=2417.0s)]
*  You know that to me that's like the best. [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=2421.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=2423.0s)]
*  Early Daily Show to me that was like during the Bush era that was like this absolute sweet spot of like comedic late night political shit. [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=2424.0s)]
*  Yeah and Bush also was they kind of made like it was different with Trump people. [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=2431.0s)]
*  I mean they Hollywood just decided they fuck their yeah either something either we don't have enough ownership over this guy or he's too much of a loose cannon whatever it is but that not excuse me not a chance or are we everybody's going to hate this dude and then everybody works with all so they have no choice. [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=2436.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=2455.0s)]
*  That's who pays their bills. [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=2456.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=2457.0s)]
*  Yeah it's also hard to satirize a guy who doesn't give a fuck about what everyone thinks. [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=2458.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=2461.0s)]

*  Yeah. [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=2607.0s)]
*  And it's one of the last southern cities that still feels kind of like I don't know it has like a new rebirth. [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=2608.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=2616.0s)]
*  Like I've gone to a lot of these cities like Montgomery. [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=2617.0s)]
*  Jackson. [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=2620.0s)]
*  You've been there. [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=2621.0s)]
*  Even Savannah during the daytime downtown kind of like Charleston. [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=2622.0s)]
*  Yeah Charleston and Charleston is popping. [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=2627.0s)]
*  Birmingham is pretty good too. [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=2629.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=2630.0s)]
*  Birmingham I hear is pretty good. [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=2631.0s)]
*  I haven't been really spent time there in the city but there's a lot of southern cities Columbus Georgia that are just like ghost towns. [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=2632.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=2639.0s)]
*  You know. [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=2640.0s)]
*  Especially Mississippi. [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=2641.0s)]
*  Oh Mississippi is a really ghost state. [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=2642.0s)]
*  Like the north part of it like the Delta. [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=2643.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=2645.0s)]
*  Shelled out towns. [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=2646.0s)]
*  It's gotten really bad man. [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=2647.0s)]
*  Yeah Mississippi is just crazy man. [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=2649.0s)]
*  A really bad branding happened I think with a lot of like a lot of the south was based on even a lot of the tourism was based on tradition like war battlefields and antebellum homes. [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=2650.0s)]
*  Things like that that I think white people didn't realize maybe as much at that black maybe black culture didn't have like or maybe it angered them. [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=2662.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=2674.0s)]
*  I think a lot of the south was based on tourism. [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=2675.0s)]
*  Maybe it angered them. [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=2677.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=2678.0s)]
*  I think a lot of that kind of came out during BLM when a lot of like statues were being torn down and like you know so I think the south also is in a little bit of a space where it's like well I don't think I was grasping on to the history there because it was racist. [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=2679.0s)]
*  I just thought it was the history like Robert E Lee that was the statue like you know we would all meet up there at Mardi Gras. [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=2694.0s)]
*  I don't think half of us knew what the fuck he did. [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=2699.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=2701.0s)]
*  You know. [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=2702.0s)]
*  But I think so a lot of the tradition there feels like it's been stirred. [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=2703.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=2708.0s)]
*  And I think a lot of people down there don't really know what to do in some southern places right now. [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=2709.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=2714.0s)]
*  I wonder when they're going to start land marking like a like hip hop achievements and shit like when I was in I was in Clarksdale and Yazoo City and the Delta and it's everything is like the you know the Delta blues trail like here's where light and Hopkins like grew up and I'm like what about Lil Wayne. [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=2715.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=2728.0s)]
*  I think we're going to start like marking the house and Holly Grove and shit because like that stuff really changed the world in a similar way that blues did you know. [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=2729.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=2735.0s)]
*  Not even a bigger impact. [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=2736.0s)]
*  But like I'm amazed they haven't done that. [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=2737.0s)]
*  I think about it all the time like hip hop heritage trail. [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=2739.0s)]
*  It's going to happen eventually. [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=2742.0s)]
*  We're going to be tripping bro. [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=2744.0s)]
*  We're going to be like 90 years old. [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=2745.0s)]
*  And they're like in the third word they're going to be like here stood with the Magnolia projects where soldiers slim and Master P and Seamurder came out with their first no limit records album. [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=2746.0s)]
*  We're going to be like what the fuck. [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=2755.0s)]
*  But it has to happen right. [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=2757.0s)]
*  Well it's almost like it's behind schedule especially since they've gone through so many of those projects and stuff over the years and torn like had to tear them down or refurbish you think somebody would have said hey let's just take this building. [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=2758.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=2768.0s)]
*  And make it make some money for the city you know. [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=2769.0s)]
*  Especially yeah they should have preserved like one of the old Magnolia buildings. [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=2771.0s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=2775.0s)]
*  Big boy where juvenile grew up. [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=2776.0s)]
*  Yeah I mean that's like the backdrop to like the birth of fucking southern rap music. [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=2778.0s)]
*  Dude I would go there in a heartbeat because it's so funny because I've gone to the ones where like Elvis was born. [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=2782.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=2786.0s)]
*  And you'll see signs like muddy gussy grew up here like people you don't even know anymore. [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=2787.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=2792.0s)]
*  But if they had like big boy like if they had a lot of different ones along that trail. [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=2793.0s)]
*  It's one of those classic things of like who's really going to campaign on that though. [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=2798.0s)]
*  It's like in Seattle you can't drink and strip clubs. [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=2801.0s)]
*  What congressman is going to be like I'm going to make this my issue. [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=2804.0s)]
*  You know I mean. [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=2808.0s)]
*  But I think these days I think you make that small pinpoint issue that catapult you from being some muppet with like or you know just somebody to be in like all you need is that one. [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=2809.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=2821.0s)]
*  And then you're in the game as long as you can. [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=2822.0s)]
*  You got to have some backup plans. [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=2824.0s)]
*  Yeah for sure. [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=2826.0s)]
*  But dude I can't believe that they have strip club where you can't drink it like this like. [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=2827.0s)]
*  But the strippers are all on pill they can fucking do pills. [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=2833.0s)]
*  But I can't drink a goddamn white club. [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=2837.0s)]
*  I thought this is America. [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=2839.0s)]
*  I feel you my dad works next to a strip club. [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=2841.0s)]
*  My dad works at a bar connected to a strip club. [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=2844.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=2846.0s)]
*  And so it's always like bar strip club back to bar back to strip club. [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=2847.0s)]
*  It's like just tear the wall down. [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=2850.0s)]
*  You know what I mean. [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=2852.0s)]
*  Oh dude we went to a strip club once in Virginia. [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=2854.0s)]
*  We were touring a couple of months ago and they're like. [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=2857.0s)]
*  Oh Edgar Allen Poe used to own this. [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=2862.0s)]
*  A strip club. [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=2865.0s)]

*  Is he from Virginia. [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=2871.0s)]
*  No I grew out in post from Baltimore. [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=2873.0s)]
*  OK well at one point he lived I guess in Virginia and he like lived there for a while or something. [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=2875.0s)]
*  Yeah like oh we used to live here. [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=2879.0s)]
*  It's like a historic building. [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=2880.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=2881.0s)]
*  But then part of the strip club. [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=2882.0s)]
*  It's pretty cool. [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=2883.0s)]
*  I didn't even know Edgar Allen Poe got down like that. [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=2884.0s)]
*  I think he got down the coast a little bit went looking for a little bit of. [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=2885.0s)]
*  Yeah he had a twisted mind. [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=2888.0s)]
*  Oh he had to. [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=2890.0s)]
*  So it must have been a twist to the strip club. [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=2891.0s)]
*  Dude he was like one of the first BLM activists. [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=2893.0s)]
*  And he was writing that The Raven or whatever. [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=2895.0s)]
*  Was that about race. [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=2897.0s)]

*  like I don't know I guess some people go probably for desperation. [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=2990.0s)]

*  palm is sweating. [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=3003.0s)]
*  You know. [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=3004.0s)]

*  Yeah because they must know that the girls don't actually like them. [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=3015.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=3019.0s)]
*  So I guess a lot of is the myth of it. [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=3020.0s)]
*  Maybe it's they want to feel like a rock star like Nickelback style. [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=3022.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=3026.0s)]
*  Like they're at the strip club. [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=3027.0s)]
*  But I mean imagine going to a strip club by yourself ordering a Jameson and smoking a [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=3028.0s)]
*  cigar like. [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=3032.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=3034.3999999999996s)]

*  I do this. [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=3040.6s)]
*  This isn't weird at all. [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=3041.6s)]
*  This is cool. [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=3042.6s)]
*  This is what rock stars do. [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=3043.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=3044.6s)]
*  But then the women are all peeled up. [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=3045.6s)]
*  It's not even this like exchange of emotion anymore. [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=3047.16s)]
*  It's just two people sharing each other hoping one of them has a has a perk on them. [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=3049.8799999999997s)]
*  You know. [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=3053.2799999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=3054.2799999999997s)]
*  That's what I feel like. [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=3055.2799999999997s)]
*  It's almost like playing perk chess with their eyes. [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=3056.2799999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=3057.64s)]

*  You know just playing just with that 220 milligram stare. [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=3061.02s)]
*  How does that make you feel to percussively. [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=3064.7400000000002s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=3066.86s)]
*  I took two so was one time and actually drove off a road on accident and my buddy I think [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=3067.86s)]
*  RIP tried to give me a BJ or something. [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=3071.5s)]
*  I don't even remember fully but I wouldn't take them. [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=3074.6600000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=3078.7400000000002s)]
*  I just have friends who take them. [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=3079.7400000000002s)]
*  I've had a friend take them. [[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=3081.7400000000002s)]
*  I looked at them like how are you feeling right now. [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=3082.94s)]
*  It's crazy. [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=3084.86s)]
*  I think it disconnects you from any senses that you have anything wrong. [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=3085.86s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=3090.46s)]

*  Oh the King and the Sting podcast. [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=3105.54s)]
*  Yeah the podcast is still going on just not. [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=3107.9s)]
*  Oh okay. [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=3110.5s)]
*  You and Brandon are cool though yeah. [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=3111.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=3113.5s)]
*  Honestly man I missed. [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=3115.14s)]
*  I couldn't I didn't have enough attention really to focus. [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=3116.94s)]
*  Like I like I like my own podcast and we have a unique kind of audience I think. [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=3120.42s)]
*  And I think I wanted to be able to I feel a lot more in touch with this now. [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=3126.18s)]
*  Like it's important to me. [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=3130.54s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=3131.54s)]
*  And it was still important but it was just a lot to try and juggle. [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=3132.54s)]
*  Yeah I liked the Gringo Poppy actually. [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=3135.1s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=3137.9s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=3138.9s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=3139.9s)]
*  People give Brandon so much flack and I think that's one of the reasons I admire him in [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=3141.06s)]
*  some ways. [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=3146.34s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=3147.34s)]
*  Is how you could withstand so much disdain from people you know or fake disdain. [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=3148.34s)]
*  Yeah it's pretty psychotic. [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=3153.54s)]
*  It's crazy isn't it. [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=3155.02s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=3156.46s)]
*  It goes back to the people you were talking about. [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=3157.46s)]
*  Yeah no for sure. [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=3158.46s)]
*  It's kind of why I stopped like I still have Instagram and stuff I just don't go on it. [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=3159.46s)]
*  Because like when you run that when you're like a major public figure whatever a big [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=3164.26s)]
*  media figure like if someone comments on your shit you're amazing at its best that's an [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=3169.34s)]
*  ego boost unhealthy ego boost. [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=3174.34s)]
*  And if someone says you suck then that's an anxiety spike. [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=3176.1400000000003s)]
*  So it's like there's no once you've kind of passed that threshold of like validation [[00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=3179.7000000000003s)]
*  from the public it's nothing but bad for your mind because this little box in your pocket [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=3183.5800000000004s)]
*  it's like oh you're the shit man you're the best journalist. [[00:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=3187.94s)]
*  I'm walking around by myself getting endorphins from that which is not natural. [[00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=3191.1000000000004s)]
*  I should be like you know touching trees playing tennis with my mom but instead it's [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=3195.02s)]
*  like and then if someone then if that box is like fuck you man you're a libtard you [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=3199.42s)]
*  sell out or something. [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=3204.3s)]
*  I'm like oh man I feel bad about myself. [[00:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=3205.62s)]
*  So there's no healthy like middle ground I don't think for me at least I'm too sensitive. [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=3209.38s)]
*  Man I'm too sensitive to it too and I still let it affect you know I let it affect me [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=3214.34s)]
*  a lot of times I notice like you're saying to have somewhere with all that I go there [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=3218.1s)]
*  for certain things. [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=3221.98s)]

*  I think it's brave to have guys on that are different. [[00:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=3509.7400000000002s)]
*  You know, like we get pitch guys sometimes or girls and I'm like, I don't know. [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=3512.7s)]
*  But then that's the part where I need to lean in and say, yes, I want to have to talk [[00:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=3516.98s)]
*  because I want to be able to share some of my truth and and or and hear something different. [[00:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=3522.26s)]
*  You know, yeah, I think I think it's you do a great job of being in that space. [[00:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=3527.42s)]
*  Do you feel like you ever go to a place just to pick on a group? [[00:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=3532.18s)]
*  Never. Not anymore. [[00:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=3535.98s)]
*  I mean, I like when I think when I first started, it was a lot of low hanging fruit. [[00:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=3537.54s)]
*  But I developed a respect for interview subjects pretty quickly. [[00:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=3542.58s)]
*  I mean, there's some groups that it's clear from, you know, how I'm talking to them, [[00:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=3546.94s)]
*  that I'm trying to sort of poke holes in what they're saying. [[00:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=3551.1s)]
*  But no, I don't go try to pick on people. [[00:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=3554.3s)]
*  You know, if anything, I try to understand the people. [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=3556.58s)]
*  Yeah. You know, because picking on people is really easy. [[00:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=3558.82s)]
*  Like anything that society sees as weird, like furries or flat earthers, [[00:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=3561.18s)]
*  it's very easy to show up, point fingers, make fun of them, ask them weird questions. [[00:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=3565.78s)]
*  But when you ask the why or how did you end up like this is when it gets really interesting [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=3570.02s)]
*  because you get to just follow that why infinitely till you get to the core of what drove them to the fringe. [[00:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=3575.18s)]
*  And that's the shit that fascinates me. [[00:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=3581.66s)]
*  That's always the same. What is it? [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=3583.2999999999997s)]
*  Just community, loneliness, isolation, being ostracized by the traditional group that they were around, [[00:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=3586.02s)]
*  online echo chambers, loneliness, personal failure, personal aspirations, common themes like old school shit. [[00:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=3593.2999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, those are tropes that have been around forever, huh? [[01:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=3601.66s)]
*  Yeah, that's what it comes back to. [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=3603.54s)]
*  What does tropes mean? Does that make any sense? [[01:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=3604.98s)]
*  It does make sense. [[01:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=3606.94s)]
*  All right, I'll take it. [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=3608.34s)]
*  Oh, it also comes back to the Jews a lot. [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=3608.9s)]
*  Really? [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=3610.78s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=3611.38s)]
*  Because they started it? [[01:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=3611.94s)]
*  No, like hella people don't like Jews. [[01:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=3612.82s)]
*  Oh yeah, Kanye was talking about that. [[01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=3615.1s)]
*  Do you think that many people don't like Jews? [[01:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=3617.94s)]
*  I think it's, I mean, I think it's because what did Kanye, they were getting on Kanye. [[01:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=3621.02s)]
*  I mean, he's been saying some horrible shit. [[01:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=3627.02s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=3628.66s)]
*  You know, that Kanye shit is sad. [[01:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=3628.98s)]
*  But do you think people should just be, should he be shut down from saying stuff or he can just say, [[01:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=3631.02s)]
*  I guess people can just say whatever they want. [[01:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=3636.38s)]
*  If he says, I'm about to go death con three on the Jews, and he's telling his audience that like, [[01:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=3637.82s)]
*  Hollywood music is totally controlled by Jews. [[01:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=3644.78s)]
*  Like it is true that there is like highly influential Jewish people in Hollywood, [[01:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=3647.82s)]
*  but it's controlled by money people, capitalists of all shapes and sizes, and they're not loyal to each other. [[01:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=3651.94s)]
*  Do you think that those type, that those, that money people aren't loyal to each other? [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=3658.38s)]
*  I mean, in a sense of collaboration, but shit, they're all trying to race to the top. [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=3662.46s)]
*  That's how it's working. [[01:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=3666.5800000000004s)]
*  And the idea that there's some sort of cohesion there, it's not really true. [[01:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=3667.78s)]
*  I mean, there is collaboration, but like what Kanye is talking about is being exploited by, you know, [[01:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=3671.42s)]
*  predatory recording, I mean, record companies and shit like that and labels. [[01:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=3678.42s)]
*  That's a real thing. [[01:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=3683.94s)]
*  The media and invading his life, you know, TMZ showing up to his house at three o'clock in the morning [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=3684.94s)]
*  and asking him about his mental health, like every element of his private life being publicized by media outlets. [[01:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=3689.7000000000003s)]
*  That's a real thing. [[01:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=3694.82s)]
*  Right. [[01:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=3695.7000000000003s)]
*  And so it's like he's so close to talking about that, but then he is obviously someone in his ear being like, [[01:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=3696.06s)]
*  it's all about the Jews. [[01:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=3700.7400000000002s)]
*  And he's like, and then my Jewish personal trainer, it's sad. [[01:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=3702.5s)]
*  A lot of people don't even know that they're being anti-Semitic. [[01:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=3706.1s)]
*  I also think the phrase anti-Semitic, it's so overused. [[01:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=3708.78s)]
*  Yeah, people say it's tough because you can't even, sometimes it feels like you can't even say the word Jew or Jewish. [[01:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=3711.98s)]
*  And you're suddenly like, this person is anti-Semitic. [[01:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=3717.1s)]
*  It's like, well, you could say black or white or Christian or, you know, Muslims or Slims, some people call them. [[01:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=3719.1s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=3725.94s)]
*  But... [[01:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=3727.1s)]
*  I'm just saying conspiracy thought, the idea that like every anomaly and everything that goes a little bit weird is not a result of human error. [[01:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=3727.9s)]
*  It's a calculated deep state plot. [[01:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=3735.46s)]
*  Every sort of loophole, there's loopholes and everyone's reporting and everything has, everything goes wrong. [[01:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=3738.06s)]
*  People think the CIA is doing all this crazy shit. [[01:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=3743.86s)]
*  They tried to kill Castro in Cuba like 45 times. [[01:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=3746.5s)]
*  The CIA can't pull off anything correctly. [[01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=3749.2599999999998s)]
*  Our government can't do anything right. [[01:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=3751.62s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=3752.9s)]
*  Yet somehow people think they're capable of these massive like mind control experiences. [[01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=3753.42s)]
*  I was like, why do the roads look like that? [[01:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=3757.62s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=3759.94s)]
*  I just don't get how people think that this all powerful deep state can manipulate and control the entire planet. [[01:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=3760.82s)]
*  Yeah, that's true. [[01:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=3767.7s)]
*  If you can't even get me from like St. George to El Paso, then how are you going to get me from like the aliens to, you know, to the octagon? [[01:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=3768.3799999999997s)]
*  Right. [[01:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=3778.74s)]
*  People are bad at secrets too, man. [[01:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=3779.2999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, people are bad at secrets. [[01:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=3781.18s)]
*  That's a good point. [[01:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=3782.3799999999997s)]
*  I always think that a lot about secrets. [[01:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=3783.1s)]
*  Like why, if somebody knew something on their deathbed, why are they going to hold on to it, especially anymore? [[01:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=3784.74s)]
*  I could see 50 years ago when there was this more like loyalism to America too, like we are this thing, like people I felt like had bought into like we are this text, this thread, this woven blanket. [[01:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=3791.14s)]
*  But now it seems like we are the like that's disappearing. [[01:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=3804.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=3810.18s)]
*  Like if they told Trump about the aliens, he would tell in a half hour, he would fucking tell us. [[01:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=3810.9s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=3815.62s)]
*  He'd be like, I will not be, you know, a puppet of the CIA. [[01:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=3816.02s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=3819.7000000000003s)]
*  There's a spacecraft below the White House. [[01:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=3820.5s)]
*  It's been there for 30 years. [[01:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=3823.7000000000003s)]
*  It's not what he sounds like. [[01:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=3825.1s)]
*  Right. [[01:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=3826.1s)]
*  That's how he would say it. [[01:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=3826.3s)]
*  Yeah, it is. [[01:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=3827.14s)]
*  Yeah, totally true. [[01:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=3828.3s)]
*  But, and that's why I don't think they could get all these pilots and people that have died over the years that I don't think they could get any of those people to keep a secret anymore. [[01:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=3829.46s)]
*  Do you think? [[01:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=3836.86s)]
*  No. [[01:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=3837.5s)]
*  Somebody would make a TikTok at half hour for their death. [[01:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=3838.5s)]
*  Like my dad just told me this. [[01:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=3841.42s)]
*  It would be the kids of these Area 51 people. [[01:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=3843.06s)]
*  They're like, so my dad just dropped the bomb on me. [[01:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=3846.1800000000003s)]
*  Like all that shit. [[01:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=3847.86s)]
*  Area 51 is so sick, dude. [[01:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=3849.7400000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=3851.6600000000003s)]
*  Have you been over there? [[01:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=3851.94s)]
*  I tried to go. [[01:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=3852.58s)]
*  I went to the raid of Area 51 in 2019. [[01:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=3853.2200000000003s)]
*  One of my first things. [[01:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=3855.34s)]
*  I think I remember that. [[01:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=3855.86s)]
*  And it was a letdown, huh? [[01:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=3857.46s)]
*  The only guy we got arrested was this like recently divorced father of three who was in like a, he was sleeping in the back of his Subaru next to our RV. [[01:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=3858.58s)]
*  And he was like, they're fucking in there and I'm going. [[01:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=3866.78s)]
*  And he tried to storm it by himself and he got like, you know, machine guns in his face. [[01:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=3869.42s)]
*  Wow. [[01:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=3874.38s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=3875.06s)]
*  Dang. [[01:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=3876.42s)]
*  Do you think, did you get the feeling when you were there that they're holding something? [[01:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=3876.86s)]
*  No, I think they're just, you know, experimenting with drones. [[01:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=3879.78s)]
*  Why would it be Area 51? [[01:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=3883.18s)]
*  Like there's merch along the whole highway saying there's aliens there. [[01:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=3885.34s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=3888.74s)]
*  They would have moved them by now through a different black box site. [[01:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=3888.98s)]
*  Do you feel like we've had a lot of encounters and you feel like we've had few? [[01:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=3893.9s)]
*  A lot, dude. [[01:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=3898.02s)]
*  Totally. [[01:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=3899.86s)]
*  Do you feel like that there are alien figures amongst us that they have that kind of technology to put people amongst us that are actually beings from other planets or worlds? [[01:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=3901.62s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=3912.66s)]
*  I mean, like you ever looked into like the eyes of like a, like a Nordic dude, like a six foot seven, like a Viking looking person, cold blue. [[01:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=3912.98s)]
*  Maybe six, four, maybe. [[01:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=3922.98s)]
*  That's evidence right there. [[01:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=3925.54s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=3930.02s)]
*  I got to look deeper next time. [[01:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=3930.3s)]
*  I think I didn't, I guess I didn't look that deep. [[01:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=3931.5s)]
*  The joke there is pretty much all alien conspiracy theorists, such as Bob Brown in Nevada, think that people from Norway are aliens. [[01:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=3933.02s)]
*  Oh, really? [[01:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=3939.34s)]
*  Or that they possess some sort of reptilian or old school Lumarian DNA. [[01:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=3940.22s)]
*  Wow. [[01:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=3946.38s)]
*  Which gives them that sort of look. [[01:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=3946.7s)]
*  That iridescent. [[01:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=3949.42s)]
*  And also the architectural capability. [[01:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=3950.1s)]
*  IKEA. [[01:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=3954.06s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=3955.78s)]
*  You want to follow the, uh, the directions or whatever. [[01:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=3956.1400000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=3959.94s)]
*  You know? [[01:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=3960.54s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=3961.34s)]
*  Damn. [[01:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=3962.26s)]
*  Well, I think sometimes that aliens come here, I think we are like aliens advanced far past us, right? [[01:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=3963.42s)]
*  Like even if you see us now, we're becoming like meeker figures. [[01:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=3968.82s)]
*  We only use our brains and you see an alien. [[01:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=3972.82s)]
*  It's like just the brain looks active. [[01:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=3974.5800000000004s)]
*  The body just looks like this dormant sort of like non-genital, no tits even anymore. [[01:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=3976.78s)]
*  Never. [[01:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=3981.9s)]
*  Just like the body seems very like you don't notice it. [[01:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=3982.9399999999996s)]
*  It's just that kind of like diamond oval head with the big eyes. [[01:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=3986.02s)]
*  So there's a lot of brain activity thinking. [[01:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=3990.2999999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=3992.5s)]
*  That's what I feel like. [[01:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=3993.2999999999997s)]
*  So aliens, they've, they've moved off here a long time ago. [[01:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=3995.06s)]
*  I think they come by every now and then to see like the plant. [[01:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=3997.2599999999998s)]
*  Like it's almost like if your parents took you like some shitty water park, it's like a poor, poor alien families. [[01:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=3999.62s)]
*  No offense. [[01:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4005.4599999999996s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4006.2599999999998s)]
*  But if an alien family is real poor, then they'll like, or they didn't get tickets to like the cool planet to go see. [[01:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4006.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4012.86s)]
*  Then they stop there. [[01:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4013.34s)]
*  The kids are like, what the fuck? [[01:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4014.22s)]
*  We're over here. [[01:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4015.42s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4016.06s)]
*  Look, this place is weird as shit. [[01:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4016.22s)]
*  Yeah, this place sucks. [[01:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4017.5s)]
*  They see the Capitol riot, like Will Smith punching Chris Rockwell. [[01:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4018.46s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4021.58s)]
*  These people are fucking morons. [[01:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4021.7799999999997s)]
*  Get up out of here. [[01:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4022.86s)]
*  Yes. [[01:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4023.62s)]
*  That's what I think happens all the time. [[01:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4024.22s)]
*  Some shitty dad tries to bring his kids here and his wife here to save their fucking family or to do, and he didn't plan ahead. [[01:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4025.46s)]
*  And the kids like to get the fuck out of here. [[01:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4031.74s)]
*  They land a Talladega race weekend. [[01:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4033.54s)]
*  They're like, what the fuck? [[01:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4035.7400000000002s)]
*  No, but I would think the aliens would actually be on a smaller level, like on microbial small level so they can, you know, kind of look at us like they could be like cell size, you know, condensed because they don't want to be identified. [[01:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4038.26s)]
*  Everyone assumes that these like gargantuan, Cthulhu looking District 9 creatures were going to come down and like scare the shit out of us. [[01:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4049.34s)]
*  But why they always look like shrimp in the movies, you know, like giant lobsters. [[01:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4057.78s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4061.26s)]
*  I think they're really like floating through the air, like little dust particles be like, you know what I'm saying? [[01:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4061.66s)]
*  Dude, that's more of a vibe to it. [[01:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4067.7s)]
*  A dust particle. [[01:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4069.06s)]
*  When you watch them, how they move, they move like alien vessels. [[01:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4069.8599999999997s)]
*  A lot of times they move with purpose. [[01:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4073.38s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4075.5s)]
*  That purposeful dust homie. [[01:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4076.8199999999997s)]
*  For real. [[01:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4078.22s)]
*  Damn. [[01:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4078.74s)]
*  That's almost what we are as humans. [[01:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4079.7799999999997s)]
*  Uh huh. [[01:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4081.7s)]
*  We're fucking, we think we're purposeful dust. [[01:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4082.42s)]
*  That's a fact. [[01:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4084.98s)]
*  Damn, bro. [[01:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4086.14s)]
*  Um, when you went, when you go into some places, do you ever have, do you have a lot of fear? [[01:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4088.1000000000004s)]
*  Obviously, you know, I understand now from like you're growing up and stuff like that and some of your energy, like, um, like I remember from my dad, my dad would sell, do like credit card sign ups at colleges and stuff. [[01:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4092.5800000000004s)]
*  And I was, when I was a kid. [[01:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4102.9400000000005s)]
*  And so, uh, we'd roll over there and like, we'd get all the shit out and like, you know, he's 78 years old, he's signing people up and I would get up on the table and bark at college kids going by to get them to come and sign up and they get like a free hat or something. [[01:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4103.860000000001s)]
*  That's fun. [[01:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4116.94s)]
*  That says like chase man, you know, something. [[01:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4117.38s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4119.42s)]
*  It's like Frisbee. [[01:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4119.7s)]
*  Now it would be cool. [[01:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4121.46s)]
*  Back then it was horrible. [[01:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4122.299999999999s)]
*  For sure. [[01:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4123.54s)]
*  But now it would be a fire hat. [[01:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4123.82s)]
*  And, uh, so I could see where you being in your environments growing up and like having like, um, interaction with people. [[01:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4125.82s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4132.9s)]
*  Where it makes you fit into your world now real comfortably. [[01:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4133.259999999999s)]
*  Are there places you've gotten in that make you, have made you kind of fearful or scared? [[01:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4136.38s)]
*  Like, [[01:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4139.86s)]
*  Honestly, not really because like with the camera rolling, people aren't really going to test you. [[01:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4140.179999999999s)]
*  I think that like the most nervous I've ever been was like, I was, uh, I was trying to do SEC games for a while. [[01:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4144.62s)]
*  So like I was at the roll tide. [[01:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4151.379999999999s)]
*  I was at the Auburn roll tide game in Tuscaloosa. [[01:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4153.179999999999s)]
*  It's a big, so home game for Alabama. [[01:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4156.0599999999995s)]
*  Alabama lost the home game. [[01:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4159.099999999999s)]
*  And so like people were fighting in the streets. [[01:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4161.259999999999s)]
*  Like, you know, you know how it goes. [[01:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4163.58s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[01:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4164.82s)]
*  College football in the South is a real serious thing. [[01:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4165.66s)]
*  I'm watching 50, 60 year old dudes who, you know, we're in there for in frats four years ago, rumble out old beefs in front of the waffle house of Tuscaloosa. [[01:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4168.54s)]
*  I'm like, man, this is tough. [[01:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4177.38s)]
*  And when people were fighting right in front of you, my first thought is I want to interview them while they're fighting. [[01:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4179.02s)]
*  Right. [[01:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4182.9400000000005s)]
*  You know, so I wanted to be like, Hey, what's going on? [[01:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4183.22s)]
*  How'd this start? [[01:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4184.780000000001s)]
*  And then they would doof, you know what I mean? [[01:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4185.660000000001s)]
*  And so, I mean, we had a couple of situations in Tuscaloosa where people would try to take our cameras and like, who the fuck are you guys? [[01:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4187.1s)]
*  And we're like, uh, YouTubers like get the fuck out of our party. [[01:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4194.18s)]
*  You know, also they're very comfortable with violence at Southern schools. [[01:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4197.42s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4200.06s)]
*  There's not really consequences for like big brawls at schools in the South, just in fraternity environments, like there would be on a regular street anywhere else. [[01:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4200.700000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4210.58s)]
*  I think Southern culture does. [[01:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4210.780000000001s)]
*  It's more like, uh, especially in the South, you're looking at more like, uh, fight outside of the bar. [[01:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4212.06s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4216.860000000001s)]
*  It's like Australians. [[01:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4217.14s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4218.02s)]
*  You know, it's just like, yeah, they settle the score after. [[01:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4218.38s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4221.14s)]
*  It's like a bunch of baked bean Australians kind of. [[01:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4221.42s)]
*  Literally. [[01:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4223.3s)]
*  And no one's called the cops really. [[01:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4223.820000000001s)]
*  They kind of let things happen. [[01:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4225.18s)]
*  Right. [[01:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4226.5s)]
*  So like, you know, that's the only place for frats is probably the worst place for me to film. [[01:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4227.700000000001s)]
*  Dude. [[01:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4233.06s)]
*  It's funny when I remember growing up. [[01:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4233.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4234.62s)]
*  Frats is a weird energy because it's also like, but then if they like you and they know who you are, then it is a different energy can be different unless you test that one dude who doesn't know. [[01:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4234.740000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4245.22s)]
*  That sometimes can be weird. [[01:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4246.54s)]
*  This was like when we were pretty like lesser known. [[01:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4247.860000000001s)]
*  So it was a lot scarier. [[01:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4251.700000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4252.58s)]
*  Probably now if I were to like message some frat in advance, I mean like I'm coming back to Ole Miss. [[01:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4252.94s)]
*  They'd be stoked. [[01:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4257.94s)]
*  They'd be like, oh, we're going to show you the best party ever. [[01:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4258.259999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4260.38s)]
*  What about I saw you that you went into O Block, you went into like Chicago and they have like a lot of like, is that one of the areas where they have a lot of crime? [[01:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4262.38s)]
*  Where they've had a lot of crime violence? [[01:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4268.62s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4270.9s)]
*  Wow. [[01:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4271.38s)]
*  I wasn't scared there or anything because like, you know, they just took good care of us. [[01:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4271.78s)]
*  Also, nobody wants to be perceived that way in media. [[01:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4275.9s)]
*  So they're going to go above and beyond to make sure that everyone knows that like when I got to O Block, everyone knew that I was coming and they were just like, hey, good to meet you. [[01:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4277.98s)]
*  We checked your stuff out. [[01:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4285.339999999999s)]
*  Welcome. [[01:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4287.38s)]
*  Yeah, that's interesting. [[01:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4288.099999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4290.7s)]
*  There you go. [[01:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4290.94s)]
*  Right there, dude. [[01:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4291.339999999999s)]
*  That's fire. [[01:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4291.98s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4293.219999999999s)]
*  I would say what they say, the hood or whatever is probably the least scary place to film. [[01:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4293.58s)]
*  Wow. [[01:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4299.099999999999s)]
*  You know, because your intention is clear. [[01:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4299.9s)]
*  You know, you're a white guy with a camera crew. [[01:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4301.98s)]
*  It's like everyone knows what that is. [[01:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4303.66s)]
*  Nothing is going to happen to you. [[01:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4306.099999999999s)]
*  That's a good point. [[01:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4307.86s)]
*  That's interesting. [[01:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4309.299999999999s)]
*  Where there's more commonality, there's more potential for violence as a journalist. [[01:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4309.78s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4315.42s)]
*  It's the classic thing of like Louis Thoreau from England. [[01:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4316.38s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4319.219999999999s)]
*  When he did his weird weekend series, him being British as an outsider, I think gave him a pass to kind of come in and be more confrontational. [[01:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4319.54s)]
*  Whereas like I'm more likely to be in a violent situation with someone who is a similar looks like me and is in a similar age range to me because they kind of feel like, oh, it's more like buddy, buddy, like brod out. [[01:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4326.78s)]
*  I even see it with fans. [[01:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4337.98s)]
*  Like any frat age white fan will come up and just bear hug the shit out of me. [[01:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4339.0199999999995s)]
*  You know, it's just less of a barrier. [[01:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4343.86s)]
*  Whereas like anyone older or younger will be a little bit more cautious or in a different socioeconomic place. [[01:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4346.139999999999s)]
*  That's interesting. [[01:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4351.86s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4352.5s)]
*  It's interesting how some fans interact or some supporters of you will interact. [[01:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4352.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4356.299999999999s)]
*  Like the other day at the airport, a guy was just yelling at me like, Dio, Dio. [[01:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4356.7s)]
*  But it was like we knew each other, but we didn't know each other. [[01:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4360.94s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4363.42s)]
*  But it was like, and he kept looking at me like I should have acted a certain way, but I didn't really know how to like, it's interesting how different people's perceptions of running across somebody that they've seen before. [[01:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4363.78s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4374.46s)]
*  I think for you too, because you podcast, like people, it's more parasocial because they feel like they've spent so much time with. [[01:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4374.7s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[01:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4380.0199999999995s)]
*  Because they get off work, they're driving home or whatever, they're listening to you like you're pretty much there in the car with them. [[01:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4380.7s)]
*  They're laughing along with you. [[01:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4385.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4387.0199999999995s)]
*  Or they're laughing along with us like right now. [[01:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4387.34s)]
*  You know? [[01:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4389.74s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4390.06s)]
*  If somebody says, I listened to the podcast, I immediately go into a different place with them as well. [[01:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4390.22s)]
*  As opposed to someone saying, I saw your standup special. [[01:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4394.38s)]
*  Or somebody just saying, uh, Hey man, I saw you on TikTok or I saw you on this or that. [[01:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4396.860000000001s)]
*  Because TikTok, uh, you know, people have cut up, I think we're almost at like a billion interact views on TikTok, right? [[01:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4401.06s)]
*  For that. [[01:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4408.9800000000005s)]
*  For just my name hashtag. [[01:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4409.700000000001s)]
*  Oh cool. [[01:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4411.14s)]
*  So kind of cool, but also like I didn't create probably most of those 90% of that. [[01:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4411.860000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4419.58s)]
*  Other people made stuff and put it out there. [[01:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4420.22s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4422.74s)]
*  So it's kind of weird. [[01:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4423.38s)]
*  So it's like, you get put out there in a way you don't even want to be maybe put out there. [[01:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4424.34s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4427.86s)]
*  Like it's still your stuff. [[01:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4428.38s)]
*  They're cutting up. [[01:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4429.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4430.3s)]
*  But it's just kind of interesting. [[01:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4430.86s)]
*  It's like, they can kind of shape whatever, you know, and then people can see you more maybe than you wanted to be seen. [[01:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4432.1s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4439.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4440.06s)]
*  And you give people a lot of yourself, you know? [[01:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4440.38s)]
*  It's interesting. [[01:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4442.06s)]
*  You have to though. [[01:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4442.78s)]
*  I feel like the comedian land's a bit different. [[01:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4443.42s)]
*  And I remember when I first came out to LA, like I went on your podcast and I went on some other comedian's podcast and I was like, damn, your guys job is hard. [[01:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4445.9s)]
*  Shout out to you guys. [[01:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4453.0599999999995s)]
*  I don't know how you come up with all this shit all the time. [[01:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4453.9s)]
*  Really? [[01:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4457.38s)]
*  You just have to have this like verbose gift of gab to just spice up. [[01:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4457.82s)]
*  Cause I'm sure like, for example, you probably have told a lot of the same stories. [[01:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4461.78s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[01:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4464.62s)]
*  And you have to come with that sort of original energy. [[01:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4465.5s)]
*  It was like when you asked me about like the hitchhiking story, like I would have told it like funnier if I hadn't already said it like 20 times. [[01:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4468.46s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4474.74s)]
*  But I feel like you guys have to have this almost like a responding ability that is just like superhuman. [[01:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4475.06s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4482.3s)]
*  I think doing it with people helps more. [[01:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4482.54s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4484.9400000000005s)]
*  You know, that's why even like right when you walked in, I really felt like I lit up on the inside because I was like, oh man, I get to talk with someone today. [[01:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4485.22s)]
*  Right. [[01:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4491.34s)]
*  And so that's, it is more, it's nicer sometimes than just talking by myself. [[01:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4491.780000000001s)]
*  You know, I find a lot of people like will send in calls to podcasts. [[01:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4497.700000000001s)]
*  Like there's a lot of guys out there struggling these days. [[01:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4501.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4503.18s)]
*  A lot of people are, we're trying to figure out what, you know, it's a weird time to be human. [[01:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4503.5s)]
*  Do you think that? [[01:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4508.66s)]
*  Yeah, definitely. [[01:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4509.5s)]
*  What do you mean by that though? [[01:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4511.22s)]
*  I feel like as we're switching more into like putting more of our feelings and everything in our intentions and everything, we're so reliant on media. [[01:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4512.22s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4521.7s)]
*  And, and just human interaction has kind of taken a backseat. [[01:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4522.1s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4526.7s)]
*  But it's also hasn't. [[01:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4527.7s)]
*  So it's this weird, like this weird thing because we're almost more interactive than ever. [[01:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4528.9s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4536.9s)]
*  But it's not very real. [[01:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4537.259999999999s)]
*  It is, but it's like, we're almost transitioning. [[01:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4540.099999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4542.82s)]
*  It's, it's, it kind of sucks. [[01:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4543.339999999999s)]
*  That's why I've tapped out from it. [[01:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4545.0599999999995s)]
*  I'm trying to reverse engineer my own life. [[01:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4546.419999999999s)]
*  Like I have like, cause I had to use Instagram and these platforms. [[01:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4548.259999999999s)]
*  I'm sure you did too, to get to where I am now. [[01:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4551.459999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4553.58s)]
*  But I've crossed this threshold where it's like, I don't need it anymore. [[01:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4553.9s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4557.66s)]
*  Like, like you probably barely do either too. [[01:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4558.139999999999s)]
*  I mean, people are going to watch your podcast and they're going to watch your specials, regardless of if you have to post stories or whatever. [[01:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4560.62s)]
*  I mean, I'm sure it helps, but it's like, once you're past that point, I'm not going to hang on social media or anything like that. [[01:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4567.0599999999995s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4572.259999999999s)]
*  It's where it got me to where I'm at, you know, but like, I'm going to tap out from it. [[01:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4572.7s)]
*  Like, cause my human interactions have been low, especially in the past two years. [[01:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4577.339999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4581.86s)]
*  Like dude, it's like my real friends, like, I don't know. [[01:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4582.22s)]
*  I need more real, real friends. [[01:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4586.02s)]
*  Not just like cool online friends, but like real homies. [[01:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4588.22s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4591.860000000001s)]
*  No, I feel you man. [[01:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4592.1s)]
*  And it gets addictive though too. [[01:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4592.66s)]
*  That's another thing about it. [[01:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4593.740000000001s)]
*  Like, I almost wondered why did they let us have phones because they're so addictive. [[01:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4595.02s)]
*  It's like, is it safe? [[01:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4599.38s)]
*  It's almost like a cigarette. [[01:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4600.66s)]
*  It's like, at a certain point where we realize this is, this has ruined us. [[01:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4601.700000000001s)]
*  Totally. [[01:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4606.5s)]
*  And Instagram is low key like kind of pornographic too. [[01:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4606.860000000001s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4610.22s)]
*  Like a social, like a, like a adrenaline porn or something? [[01:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4610.66s)]
*  No, like it literally is. [[01:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4614.62s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[01:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4616.3s)]
*  I see them tits on there. [[01:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4616.74s)]
*  No, like, like, like a lot of my friends, like I look at their feeds and it's just [[01:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4618.0599999999995s)]
*  like attractive women, attractive men just like constantly. [[01:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4621.18s)]
*  And I'm like, damn, that must be kind of weird for you. [[01:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4624.58s)]
*  That's all your influence. [[01:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4627.3s)]
*  Like you're like going on your phone and just like scrolling through like people [[01:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4628.3s)]
*  you think are like super bomb all the time. [[01:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4631.22s)]
*  Like, kind of rots your brain a little bit. [[01:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4633.0199999999995s)]
*  Like, you know, you're going through your day and you're like, you bet. [[01:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4635.0199999999995s)]
*  They look amazing. [[01:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4637.82s)]
*  They look amazing. [[01:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4638.46s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4639.0599999999995s)]
*  Oh, that's the homie. [[01:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4639.54s)]
*  I'm missing out. [[01:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4640.18s)]
*  I'm missing out. [[01:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4640.66s)]
*  This person looks good. [[01:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4641.22s)]
*  I'm like, dude, that that sucks. [[01:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4642.1s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4643.9800000000005s)]
*  Cause the second you go back to your regular world, when you take that away from [[01:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4644.14s)]
*  your eyes and you look at your regular world, your regular world doesn't stand [[01:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4646.900000000001s)]
*  a chance, right? [[01:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4649.54s)]
*  Really? [[01:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4651.14s)]
*  And it's designed like that. [[01:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4651.66s)]
*  Right. [[01:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4652.780000000001s)]
*  You know, right. [[01:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4653.14s)]
*  That's the part I think people don't realize, man, we don't realize that there [[01:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4653.860000000001s)]
*  are these shape shifting goons Jews, you know, in the distance who are, you know, [[01:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4657.38s)]
*  but that's, uh, we don't realize that a lot of that has been. [[01:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4665.78s)]
*  I, you know, it's, it's been, I mean, they have got us down to an algorithm. [[01:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4670.900000000001s)]
*  Jordan Peterson talks about that. [[01:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4674.860000000001s)]
*  It's like, we can't, the algorithm is so strong. [[01:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4676.02s)]
*  If you want to still own yourself, you have to almost come to, you have to [[01:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4678.9800000000005s)]
*  come to your own rescue, man. [[01:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4683.38s)]
*  Yeah, you do. [[01:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4685.18s)]
*  And it was algorithm for everything. [[01:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4686.34s)]
*  And people only realize when they're in it, like even Jordan Pearson talking [[01:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4688.18s)]
*  about that, he's also got an algorithm. [[01:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4690.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4692.22s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4692.58s)]
*  And once you, if you watch one Jordan Peterson video, you're going to, they're [[01:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4693.06s)]
*  going to, you're going to see him every day. [[01:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4696.22s)]
*  And the same goes for a [[01:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4697.38s)]
*  Jordan Peterson cookbook lobster. [[01:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4698.46s)]

*  Lobster. [[01:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4699.900000000001s)]
*  Lobster. [[01:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4700.34s)]
*  Like for an experiment, you know, the mob boss, Michael Franzese. [[01:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4700.620000000001s)]
*  Yes. [[01:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4703.1s)]
*  I watched one Vlad TV interview with Michael Franzese and I'm like, [[01:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4703.540000000001s)]
*  let me watch four of these. [[01:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4706.42s)]
*  Dude, my phone was like a mafia phone for like a week. [[01:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4707.780000000001s)]
*  Every time I go on there, it's like Sammy the Bull describes his first hit. [[01:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4710.9400000000005s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4714.540000000001s)]
*  And it's just like best soprano scenes, you know, good fellas intro. [[01:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4715.740000000001s)]
*  And I'm, dude, I'm watching this shit all day. [[01:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4719.540000000001s)]
*  You know, I'm like Lacosa Nostra over here on my phone for a fucking week. [[01:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4721.5s)]
*  And you know, I start talking like these dudes. [[01:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4724.9800000000005s)]
*  I start talking to my homies about the mafia. [[01:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4729.820000000001s)]
*  My guy, Evan's like, dude, stop talking about the mob. [[01:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4731.700000000001s)]
*  I'm like, you know, I'm like, no, but it's crazy. [[01:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4734.3s)]
*  The code of silence is crazy. [[01:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4736.54s)]
*  It's like blood, blood out, you know, but not all Sicilians are bad. [[01:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4737.700000000001s)]
*  You know, Evan's like, stop saying this shit. [[01:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4741.46s)]
*  Let's talk about something else. [[01:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4743.3s)]
*  And I'm like, I realized, you know, all moments of privacy, which should have [[01:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4744.46s)]
*  been me time to think about my life. [[01:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4748.34s)]
*  I was thinking about Lacosa Nostra and that's not right. [[01:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4750.26s)]
*  No one should think about the mob for more than like an hour a week. [[01:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4753.780000000001s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[01:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4756.46s)]
*  I think even that seemed like a lot, you know, especially if it's not a recipe [[01:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4757.14s)]
*  coming really shortly after the thoughts. [[01:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4760.660000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4762.46s)]
*  You think the mob is still around? [[01:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4763.34s)]
*  If they are, first of all, I noticed, I noticed for a fact, they do a lot of just [[01:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4765.22s)]
*  trash hauling is what they do now. [[01:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4769.22s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4770.9400000000005s)]
*  The mob has severely been reduced. [[01:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4771.26s)]
*  You don't think they're walking into like stump town coffee in Brooklyn, [[01:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4773.42s)]
*  breaking kneecaps and being like, give me five cents off this latte. [[01:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4776.780000000001s)]
*  I think they're like the Comedy Central. [[01:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4780.5s)]
*  Basically they're like Comedy Central. [[01:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4782.46s)]
*  Like they just fucking didn't get on social media and they fucking fell apart. [[01:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4783.780000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4787.860000000001s)]
*  They should have adapted. [[01:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4788.42s)]
*  Oh, I like a dope ass like cartel style branding campaign. [[01:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4789.660000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4793.3s)]
*  Instead they started like a Jordan Klepper show or something and it fucking tanked [[01:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4793.58s)]
*  and they never got their feet back under them. [[01:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4797.46s)]
*  Let's bring them back, dude. [[01:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4800.9400000000005s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4802.26s)]
*  I mean, I don't know, but the mafia, I would love to see them back. [[01:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4802.5s)]
*  I would love a fucking Italian or just beat and hit me with a bat when I'm going [[01:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4805.660000000001s)]
*  for a job. [[01:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4809.06s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4809.74s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4810.099999999999s)]
*  You motherfucker. [[01:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4810.3s)]
*  Cause here's one thing I realized. [[01:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4812.82s)]
*  If somebody walked up to me and punched me for no reason, right. [[01:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4814.099999999999s)]
*  But they said, you know what that's for. [[01:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4818.179999999999s)]
*  I would find some, I would find a reason in my head why. [[01:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4821.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4825.5s)]
*  And I was like, damn, okay. [[01:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4826.0599999999995s)]
*  I think you could do that to anybody. [[01:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4828.54s)]
*  What do you think would be the first thing that would come to mind? [[01:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4830.0199999999995s)]
*  Probably stealing something when I was younger, maybe. [[01:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4835.62s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4839.5s)]
*  You know, bad sex, maybe. [[01:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4840.46s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4843.5s)]
*  Like you had me drive all the way over there for that bad sex. [[01:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4844.06s)]
*  Or you made my sister come over for that bad sex. [[01:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4846.860000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4849.780000000001s)]
*  You were heavy into stealing when you were younger. [[01:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4851.700000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4853.780000000001s)]
*  I like to have stuff, man. [[01:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4854.02s)]
*  And I'd tell people I'd have their stuff on and tell them I didn't have it. [[01:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4855.58s)]
*  You know? [[01:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4858.34s)]

*  Yeah. [[01:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4860.14s)]
*  And even undergarments, men's undergarments. [[01:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4861.26s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4863.740000000001s)]
*  You've came a long way, man. [[01:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4866.38s)]

*  And you know, it's HBO. [[01:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4908.38s)]
*  And especially you came, you had some bad, you had bad experiences with that before, [[01:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4910.5s)]
*  right? [[01:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4913.38s)]
*  Hell yeah, dude. [[01:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4913.7s)]
*  I remember you were in, right after I met you through with King and the Sting, [[01:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4914.38s)]
*  you, that's when you got into the dispute with your own organization. [[01:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4919.14s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4922.58s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4922.860000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4923.18s)]
*  That was a horrible thing. [[01:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4923.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4924.54s)]
*  But you know, I'm happy that it ended in like a cataclysmic fucking gnarly way [[01:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4925.179999999999s)]
*  because I had to go independent. [[01:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4929.9s)]
*  Like I had to start channel five because I had like the fire under my ass being like, [[01:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4931.34s)]
*  you know, you got fucked over, like respawn, kill it, like start your own thing. [[01:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4936.5s)]
*  And that thing is going to be bigger. [[01:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4941.34s)]
*  You know, I feel like if I didn't have that dramatic split from the all gas, no [[01:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4943.0199999999995s)]
*  breaks parent company, I'd probably would have just drifted into like comedic [[01:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4946.98s)]
*  obscurity, honestly. [[01:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4950.259999999999s)]
*  What do you, what was a moment in there? [[01:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4951.82s)]
*  What was some more of that? [[01:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4953.5s)]
*  Tell me about that. [[01:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4954.42s)]
*  So cause other people, this happens, this happens to people a lot where people, [[01:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4954.9400000000005s)]
*  you know, they're kind of the deal isn't right, or they don't feel like if they [[01:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4957.9800000000005s)]
*  leave something that they're still going to be able to survive. [[01:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4961.02s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4963.82s)]
*  There's just very low regulation and like the Instagram and tick tock management [[01:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4964.02s)]
*  world. [[01:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4968.74s)]
*  It's not like film and, you know, acting and shit where you have guilds and unions. [[01:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4969.3s)]
*  Like you can get pimped, you can get the blood pimped out of you by someone who [[01:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4973.18s)]
*  manages influencers. [[01:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4976.42s)]
*  There's no rules or regulations. [[01:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4977.66s)]
*  It's like a wild west. [[01:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4979.1s)]
*  I, there's been contracts much worse than mine, but I had what they call a [[01:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4980.62s)]
*  360 deal. [[01:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4984.34s)]
*  They talk about it a lot in rap music. [[01:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4985.62s)]
*  You know, it's a full management contract. [[01:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4987.66s)]
*  So that means I can't acquire any money or get any, if I, if I get a sponsorship [[01:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4989.26s)]
*  deal, it runs through the parent company. [[01:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4993.34s)]
*  Every stream of revenue that is to Andrew Callahan will have to be processed by the [[01:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4995.06s)]
*  parent company and they'll give me 20% of that profit after expenses are recouped. [[01:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=4998.9800000000005s)]
*  So it's a shitty deal. [[01:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=5004.02s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=5005.14s)]
*  It was good at first because they gave me 45 K a year, bought me an RV. [[01:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=5005.860000000001s)]
*  I thought I was in heaven, but there was no show yet. [[01:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=5009.5s)]
*  Right. [[01:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=5012.02s)]
*  As the show got bigger and bigger, you know, we're getting, I see that we're [[01:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=5012.62s)]
*  making like so much on Patreon every month and through merch and I'm like, I [[01:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=5016.02s)]

*  Yeah, I deserve more. [[01:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=5023.06s)]
*  I'm getting paid literally the salary of a manager raising canes and like, shout [[01:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=5023.9400000000005s)]
*  out to them. [[01:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=5028.7s)]

*  They're not even a sponsor. [[01:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=5031.820000000001s)]
*  I don't even love this hat. [[01:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=5032.58s)]
*  Sorry, go on. [[01:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=5035.58s)]
*  And then like, man. [[01:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=5036.5s)]
*  So, yeah. [[01:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=5039.900000000001s)]
*  So that happened. [[01:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=5040.9s)]
*  It happens to people, but it ended up making you didn't fold though. [[01:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=5041.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=5045.78s)]
*  I mean, so back to it. [[01:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=5046.099999999999s)]
*  I mean, the big lesson from that whole shit is like, read your contracts and [[01:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=5046.98s)]
*  know what real money looks like, you know, cause before you start, you know, really [[01:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=5051.259999999999s)]
*  succeeding in media 45 K a year seems like a great deal. [[01:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=5054.74s)]
*  Then in the world of adults, that's like a below standard salary, right? [[01:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=5059.219999999999s)]
*  But you just don't know that because you're young as fuck. [[01:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=5063.099999999999s)]
*  You were 21, 22. [[01:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=5064.86s)]
*  I was just interning for Seattle weekly and writing for my college newspaper for [[01:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=5065.82s)]
*  free. [[01:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=5069.0199999999995s)]
*  So it's like, anyways, somewhere right before Augusto breaks kind of tanked, we [[01:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=5069.42s)]
*  signed a deal to make a movie with Tim and Eric's company. [[01:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=5075.58s)]
*  Absolutely. [[01:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=5078.18s)]
*  And then Jonah Hill's company, strong baby latched onto it and it became this whole [[01:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=5078.9800000000005s)]
*  like lot of chefs in the kitchen making this. [[01:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=5082.14s)]
*  The movie is about the 2020 election and the events that led up to the Capitol [[01:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=5084.34s)]
*  riot and the aftermath. [[01:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=5089.3s)]
*  So we're making this movie. [[01:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=5091.54s)]
*  I don't remember. [[01:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=5093.62s)]
*  I'm in the South Philly Walmart in this RV. [[01:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=5094.1s)]
*  We're out of propane. [[01:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=5098.139999999999s)]
*  So there was no heat. [[01:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=5099.38s)]
*  It's 21 degrees and I'm getting these emails from the Augusto breaks parent [[01:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=5100.7s)]
*  company. [[01:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=5104.58s)]
*  They're like, we need you to produce two pieces of Patreon content or we're going [[01:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=5104.9s)]
*  to fire you guys. [[01:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=5109.259999999999s)]
*  And this is while I'm making a movie and I'm like, I don't have time to do that. [[01:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=5110.94s)]
*  I I'm freezing. [[01:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=5114.58s)]
*  It was horrible. [[01:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=5115.9s)]
*  And so I kind of refused, you know, I asked for more money. [[01:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=5116.98s)]
*  I said, okay, I'll work a second job. [[01:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=5119.94s)]
*  Now just give me more than 20% of the profit share. [[01:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=5121.58s)]
*  They're like, nah, we're keeping you at 20%. [[01:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=5124.58s)]
*  They fired Nick and Evan just to make a statement after I asked them for more [[01:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=5127.14s)]
*  bread. [[01:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=5130.62s)]
*  And those are your associates. [[01:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=5131.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=5132.58s)]
*  Still they they're partners and owners of Channel 5. [[01:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=5132.820000000001s)]
*  Right. [[01:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=5135.38s)]
*  And then like, yeah, dude, it just got so bad. [[01:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=5135.860000000001s)]
*  They were just being like, I got this thing in the mail, my LA house. [[01:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=5139.06s)]
*  It was like, if you don't make a video for Augusto breaks by the end of the [[01:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=5142.38s)]
*  month, you're fired in the mail. [[01:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=5146.22s)]
*  What are they? [[01:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=5148.820000000001s)]
*  Are they, where did they send it from the past? [[01:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=5149.14s)]
*  Did they travel back in time? [[01:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=5151.780000000001s)]
*  I know, right? [[01:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=5153.06s)]
*  A letter. [[01:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=5153.700000000001s)]
*  What's going on? [[01:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=5154.3s)]
*  This is insane. [[01:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=5154.9800000000005s)]
*  But looking back on it, I mean, I'm like I said, I'm glad it fell apart. [[01:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=5155.74s)]
*  I don't have really negative feelings towards any of those guys. [[01:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=5158.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=5161.26s)]
*  You know, I was, I was always supposed to be independent. [[01:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=5161.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=5164.78s)]
*  You know, you always have been probably really in your own way. [[01:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=5165.54s)]
*  Yeah, for sure. [[01:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=5167.78s)]
*  You'd like being, it seems like you like having control over what you put out. [[01:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=5168.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=5173.78s)]
*  In a way I almost feel bad for those guys because they made such a bad [[01:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=5174.179999999999s)]
*  business decision. [[01:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=5179.26s)]
*  Right. [[01:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=5180.179999999999s)]
*  Well, at first they made a great business because they saw the value in you. [[01:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=5180.94s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=5184.0599999999995s)]
*  So that's almost, that's cool. [[01:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=5184.9400000000005s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=5187.22s)]
*  But then they chose to not do it fairly. [[01:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=5187.82s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=5192.26s)]
*  Cause I would have kept working for all gas and the brakes. [[01:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=5192.5s)]
*  Like the show would have been going right now if they would have just been [[01:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=5194.7s)]
*  like Andrew wants more money. [[01:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=5196.86s)]
*  Sure. [[01:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=5198.62s)]
*  Give it to them. [[01:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=5199.18s)]
*  But I remember the dude said to me, we have a bunch of connections in the [[01:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=5199.9400000000005s)]
*  comedy world, we'll be fine. [[01:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=5202.9800000000005s)]
*  We're going to replace you. [[01:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=5205.3s)]
*  And I was like, bro, I do the editing. [[01:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=5207.22s)]
*  It's my show. [[01:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=5209.46s)]
*  It's like my concept. [[01:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=5210.18s)]
*  They actually created a bunch of copycat pages that are active right now with my [[01:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=5211.54s)]
*  exact style, with other comedians hosting it. [[01:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=5215.820000000001s)]
*  It's just a shameful endeavor, but you know, I don't know. [[01:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=5219.06s)]
*  Sometimes you take L's and you just got to keep pushing, but I think they should [[01:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=5223.5s)]
*  have just left my formula alone. [[01:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=5226.38s)]
*  Yeah, dude. [[01:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=5228.9400000000005s)]
*  I mean, if you put a bunch of L's together, bro, you got a bunch of L's, but [[01:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=5229.58s)]
*  you fucking, you might be doing better. [[01:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=5235.58s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=5237.820000000001s)]
*  But amen. [[01:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=5238.820000000001s)]
*  Shout out to those guys. [[01:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=5239.5s)]
*  Like they put me on it first, you know, to get attitude to have, man. [[01:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=5240.34s)]
*  I try not to have any, I just try to like, not be negative about shit, you [[01:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=5244.66s)]
*  know, even though it's easy to be, especially when you like got kind of burned [[01:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=5248.14s)]
*  like that, but once you, once you start being negative, people start being [[01:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=5251.780000000001s)]
*  negative back, I know it's basic, but like even with my O block video, you [[01:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=5257.66s)]
*  know, like I had, like, I showed two other like journalists in that, maybe not [[01:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=5261.18s)]
*  in like the best light, you know, cause I was doing like a sort of expose about [[01:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=5267.34s)]
*  like what I saw is like the exploitation of like drill music by like media [[01:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=5272.3s)]
*  members who run like an interview cycle based upon like fact checking someone's [[01:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=5278.14s)]
*  street credibility for clicks and views. [[01:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=5282.18s)]
*  Talked about how that actually fuels real life violence because it kind of breaks [[01:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=5285.18s)]
*  down the inner workings of gang beef to like the general listening public and [[01:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=5288.82s)]
*  just makes people like not only fans of the music, but fans of like the gang [[01:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=5293.86s)]
*  lore behind the music, which you know what I'm saying? [[01:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=5297.62s)]
*  Oh, interesting. [[01:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=5300.259999999999s)]
*  No, I know what you're saying. [[01:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=5300.9s)]
*  I just, I'm trying to imagine how a channel would do something like that. [[01:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=5302.139999999999s)]
*  Or basically like, um, uh, drill music is like completely full of like [[01:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=5305.0199999999995s)]
*  dissing people's dead family members, dissing dead enemies. [[01:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=5312.259999999999s)]
*  There's a whole gang lore behind every drill scene, whether it be [[01:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=5315.94s)]
*  Jacksonville, Philadelphia, Chicago, with specific characters and legends. [[01:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=5319.339999999999s)]
*  And people like that, but the general YouTube public didn't know about what [[01:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=5323.74s)]
*  they were saying until like a second industry of, uh, you know, people who [[01:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=5329.0599999999995s)]
*  I call gang gossip YouTubers ran like a news circuit based upon like breaking [[01:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=5334.78s)]
*  shit down, you know, and like that sort of expose the inner workings of, of like [[01:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=5340.0199999999995s)]
*  Chicago's gang conflict to like the just greater civilian public stoke the [[01:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=5345.099999999999s)]
*  flames of it made it worse. [[01:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=5349.86s)]
*  Is that helpful when they do that? [[01:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=5352.139999999999s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=5353.42s)]
*  I think that, uh, it's just clickbait. [[01:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=5354.14s)]
*  I think that at its best, like there's some people who do it really well. [[01:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=5356.02s)]
*  Like there's one guy, um, trap Laura Ross. [[01:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=5359.22s)]
*  He does like a really good job at like, you know, breaking down sort of the [[01:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=5361.9400000000005s)]
*  insanity and like the specifics of certain conflicts that should people [[01:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=5366.02s)]
*  should know about, you know, cause there's people dying about like the [[01:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=5370.5s)]
*  hundreds here, like in Jacksonville. [[01:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=5373.14s)]
*  Right. [[01:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=5374.9800000000005s)]
*  But I think that when it's a, a gossip based click cycle, like you'll never [[01:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=5375.42s)]
*  guess what gang this rapper's from. [[01:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=5378.86s)]
*  You know, that to me is whack. [[01:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=5381.3s)]
*  Right. [[01:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=5383.139999999999s)]
*  But what I was saying is in the O-Block video, I interviewed two dudes who [[01:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=5383.62s)]
*  were in that world and I just felt like, while I do have my problems with like [[01:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=5387.54s)]
*  how they use their platform to a certain degree, it felt bad coming at anyone. [[01:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=5392.099999999999s)]
*  I don't want to do it again. [[01:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=5398.0599999999995s)]
*  You know, like just putting the, putting any negativity in the world. [[01:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=5400.139999999999s)]
*  Like I felt it kind of come back towards me when they had their responses and [[01:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=5402.94s)]
*  then people were, and I was just like, man, I don't want to start any beef with [[01:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=5408.0199999999995s)]
*  any other media members. [[01:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=5410.82s)]
*  Like, fuck all that. [[01:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=5411.7s)]
*  Like, you know, yeah. [[01:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=5412.78s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=5415.94s)]
*  It's tough to navigate because sometimes people will steal, like, we'll borrow [[01:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=5416.139999999999s)]
*  your shit or do something like that too. [[01:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=5418.7s)]
*  And you're like, man, this is fucked up. [[01:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=5420.259999999999s)]
*  It's like, do I want to, you know, like, it's like, do I call this out? [[01:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=5421.58s)]
*  Like there's a clothing company that like totally copied a shirt that I made, [[01:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=5425.3s)]
*  right? [[01:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=5428.179999999999s)]
*  Like a merchant was like, do I bring this up or is that just going to bring [[01:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=5428.54s)]
*  more attention to them? [[01:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=5432.139999999999s)]
*  You know? [[01:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=5433.42s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=5433.94s)]
*  It's tough to navigate sometimes stuff like that. [[01:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=5434.5s)]
*  I know that's a different comparison. [[01:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=5436.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=5438.0199999999995s)]
*  But it's like, once you start calling people out for shit and then all of a [[01:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=5439.02s)]
*  sudden you're susceptible because people, now that you've stooped to that level of [[01:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=5441.7s)]
*  like internet beef, people start realizing it's an opportunity to capitalize on you [[01:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=5444.62s)]
*  and they start internet beefing with you because they know that you play that game [[01:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=5449.54s)]
*  now and I just don't want to do it. [[01:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=5452.58s)]
*  I stand behind my coverage of Oblok, but it's just like, I don't know. [[01:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=5454.22s)]
*  Is it scary to see like, you know, you get environments like that where there's a [[01:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=5458.26s)]
*  lot of violence, you know, a lot of like growing up, like two of my closest black [[01:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=5461.62s)]
*  friends from growing up, both got killed. [[01:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=5465.74s)]
*  Right. [[01:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=5467.54s)]
*  And by other black guys growing up, there's just a lot of like violence, you [[01:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=5468.179999999999s)]
*  know, there's a lot of black young men killed, you know, there's a lot of [[01:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=5472.7s)]
*  violence in that community. [[01:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=5476.379999999999s)]
*  You see a lot of like the rap music and stuff and you know, I love the music, but [[01:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=5477.98s)]
*  is it, I wonder sometimes I find like by listening to this music, am I just [[01:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=5483.82s)]
*  perpetuating part of this thing? [[01:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=5487.86s)]
*  Well, the music is very much a part of the circumstances and like a reflection of [[01:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=5490.179999999999s)]
*  the environment and the culture that creates it. [[01:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=5494.7s)]
*  The real villain in the story of the mainstream proliferation of drill music [[01:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=5497.099999999999s)]
*  is the record labels who are fucking pushing this shit and like owning the [[01:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=5502.099999999999s)]
*  masters to mainstream hits about like basically doing mass shootings, you know? [[01:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=5505.98s)]
*  So as a listener, man, it sounds dope. [[01:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=5510.5s)]
*  No, you're not perpetuating it. [[01:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=5513.46s)]
*  The music sounds tight. [[01:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=5514.58s)]
*  They could be talking about whatever, right? [[01:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=5515.54s)]
*  But it's the, it's the record labels that, you know, make kids bought versions of [[01:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=5517.099999999999s)]
*  songs and shit like that, you know, to, to me, I felt like when I do something [[01:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=5520.42s)]
*  again, if I ever step back into the realm of covering drill music, I feel like the [[01:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=5526.42s)]
*  record labels and the people who control and incentivize that are the missing sort [[01:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=5530.86s)]
*  of investigation, the missing piece to my investigative reporting, you know? [[01:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=5536.9s)]
*  Do you feel like you're like you bow your reporting down to anything like you, [[01:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=5541.7s)]
*  there's like there's angles you're afraid to go to or things you won't talk about. [[01:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=5545.9s)]
*  Like it's hard to stay neutral. [[01:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=5549.9400000000005s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=5554.9s)]
*  I mean, I'll talk about whatever, but there's certain issues that I take more seriously [[01:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=5555.14s)]
*  than others. [[01:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=5558.38s)]
*  It's hard to stay out of the pocket of big business too, you know, as you grow. [[01:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=5558.9400000000005s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=5563.660000000001s)]
*  Cause they'll, they'll take your clips and they'll run them if it is with their agenda. [[01:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=5563.9800000000005s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=5568.38s)]
*  Or they could start to make you look a certain way, like this guy does this or, you [[01:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=5569.02s)]
*  know, they have just, there's a lot of power out there, especially when you start to [[01:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=5572.06s)]
*  succeed. [[01:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=5574.820000000001s)]
*  And that's why I wanted to get off social media. [[01:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=5575.38s)]
*  Cause it's like, I remember one time I was like out in a nice restaurant and like I [[01:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=5576.9400000000005s)]
*  had like, I had to got shots for everybody and someone took a picture of me and they [[01:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=5580.900000000001s)]
*  were like, I see where our Patriot money is going. [[01:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=5584.42s)]
*  Oh wow. [[01:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=5587.22s)]
*  You know, it's like that where I'm just like, bro, like I just like, let me enjoy my [[01:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=5587.74s)]
*  life to a degree. [[01:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=5591.78s)]
*  Like I'm supporting my entire family now, basically, you know what I mean? [[01:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=5592.54s)]
*  So it's like, I don't know, man, success is hella weird. [[01:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=5595.86s)]
*  Cause I never thought it'd be someone who was successful and it comes with a whole [[01:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=5599.54s)]
*  different responsibility and it's harder to make real friends. [[01:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=5602.7s)]
*  It's scary kind of, isn't it? [[01:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=5605.74s)]
*  It's hella scary, especially when you're young, you know, and you, you, you, you [[01:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=5606.900000000001s)]
*  popped off when you were young too. [[01:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=5609.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=5610.900000000001s)]
*  So you know what it's like? [[01:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=5611.18s)]
*  It's like, damn, like I have less friends than ever, you know, but the friends that [[01:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=5611.9s)]
*  I do have really strong, but like I can't be around it. [[01:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=5616.5s)]
*  And your own ego, I got scared of my own ego too, because you know, feeling like I [[01:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=5619.58s)]
*  had, I was at a loss, you know, of like, uh, attention or affection growing up. [[01:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=5623.179999999999s)]
*  And I was like, oh, this is important. [[01:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=5627.98s)]
*  You know, like this specific part of it, you know, that can be scary. [[01:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=5631.0599999999995s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=5634.58s)]
*  It's all interesting. [[01:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=5635.099999999999s)]
*  I think people look for like, uh, examples of ego exaggeration too, to be like, oh, [[01:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=5636.099999999999s)]
*  this guy's super full of himself because he did this. [[01:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=5640.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=5642.86s)]
*  Like once you succeed, people look for a villain arc to be like, oh, he used to be [[01:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=5643.26s)]
*  dope, but you know, now he's at Soho house and he's going to Equinox and paying for [[01:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=5648.22s)]
*  hot stone massages. [[01:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=5653.78s)]
*  And I just saw him with AirPods in, you know, fuck that guy. [[01:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=5654.98s)]
*  What a sellout. [[01:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=5658.38s)]
*  You know, and like, that's a real narrative, especially, you know, I'm someone [[01:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=5659.139999999999s)]
*  who like cares about, you know, issues of like racial justice and shit. [[01:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=5662.86s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=5665.74s)]
*  So it's like, that's not that compatible with having money. [[01:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=5666.0199999999995s)]
*  And my goal is not to have money, but it's like, when you succeed, people kind of [[01:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=5669.0599999999995s)]
*  know you're doing, you're doing well. [[01:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=5673.459999999999s)]
*  And like every time I sell merch, which is like the money goes right back into [[01:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=5674.78s)]
*  funding channel five, but everyone's just like, I have fun, like grifting or whatever. [[01:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=5678.62s)]
*  I'm just like, whatever people want to support you. [[01:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=5683.54s)]
*  People want to have your stuff. [[01:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=5685.98s)]
*  They want to be like, oh, I like this. [[01:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=5687.219999999999s)]
*  This is something cool. [[01:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=5688.7s)]
*  I used to think about that. [[01:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=5689.94s)]
*  We try to sell merch at a fair price and we try to do the best that we can. [[01:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=5690.78s)]
*  And at a certain point you can spend all day. [[01:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=5694.82s)]
*  I can sit there and be like a guy who's handling all my merch stuff or merch issues, [[01:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=5696.74s)]
*  but then I'm not even creating anything that people want or even honoring myself. [[01:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=5700.42s)]
*  I'd be in. [[01:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=5704.98s)]
*  It's like, there's only so many wars you can fight, you know, dude, for sure. [[01:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=5705.5s)]
*  And that's why I'm just like chilling on the chill on the Instagram. [[01:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=5709.94s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=5713.179999999999s)]
*  Good for you, man. [[01:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=5714.0199999999995s)]
*  It's brave and it's hard to do. [[01:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=5714.74s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=5716.179999999999s)]
*  It's like vaping for your fucking ego. [[01:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=5716.62s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=5719.42s)]
*  I'm one month off. [[01:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=5719.62s)]
*  Crazy. [[01:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=5721.26s)]
*  Damn. [[01:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=5722.0199999999995s)]
*  That's powerful, dude. [[01:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=5722.7s)]
*  I didn't know that. [[01:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=5723.38s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=5724.42s)]
*  I'm not going to believe I'm not. [[01:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=5725.0599999999995s)]
*  I'm not going to make any public statement being like screen time is bad for you. [[01:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=5726.66s)]
*  The coolest thing to do is just withdraw on your own time because the only thing [[01:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=5730.46s)]
*  lamer than being addicted to Instagram is being one of those people who's like [[01:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=5733.98s)]
*  publicly against Instagram on Instagram. [[01:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=5736.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=5739.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRusbkFVjlU&t=5739.38s)]
