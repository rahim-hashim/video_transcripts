*  I gotta get spend some time over there. I haven't spent that much time over there. Um [[01:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4h66bCg8Ldc&t=4301.5s)]
*  So yeah, what's it like for you because you weren't a comedian then not really I was a tick tocker, right? [[01:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4h66bCg8Ldc&t=4305.74s)]
*  but I wonder if that's just the new like [[01:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4h66bCg8Ldc&t=4311.66s)]
*  You know something's happening in comedy right now too where [[01:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4h66bCg8Ldc&t=4315.5s)]
*  There's a lot of videos that are being put up or crowd work [[01:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4h66bCg8Ldc&t=4318.78s)]
*  Yes, and it's not like a lot of material there's people doing crowd work [[01:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4h66bCg8Ldc&t=4323.34s)]
*  tours [[01:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4h66bCg8Ldc&t=4328.28s)]
*  It's crazy, right? Like it's really [[01:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4h66bCg8Ldc&t=4330.14s)]
*  Because it just makes me think like and i'm not judging it i'm just looking at it [[01:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4h66bCg8Ldc&t=4333.42s)]
*  But it's like sustainable [[01:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4h66bCg8Ldc&t=4337.9800000000005s)]
*  Right and then like are we getting to the point where like things are liquidating kind of where it's like you don't need material anymore [[01:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4h66bCg8Ldc&t=4339.9s)]
*  But because I I hear from some people it's like, oh i'm tired of seeing crowd work [[01:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4h66bCg8Ldc&t=4347.9800000000005s)]
*  And it's like well [[01:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4h66bCg8Ldc&t=4352.94s)]
*  But that's also a masterful art, you know if you can do it [[01:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4h66bCg8Ldc&t=4354.3s)]
*  Well done, right a lot of the crowd work i see on tiktok is like, what do you do bro's a banker? [[01:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4h66bCg8Ldc&t=4357.26s)]
*  Yeah, and that's the joke. What are you talking about? What's funny? Like I don't you know what I mean? Yeah [[01:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4h66bCg8Ldc&t=4362.14s)]
*  But it is interesting. I had a guy say the other day is like, you know one guy I love him [[01:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4h66bCg8Ldc&t=4368.38s)]
*  But he doesn't post anything with any material anymore. It's just [[01:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4h66bCg8Ldc&t=4372.14s)]
*  But then also it's like you have to save your material for when people come out [[01:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4h66bCg8Ldc&t=4376.38s)]
*  To see your live show. Yeah, like when you go on Fallon or whatever and you have to burn bits. It's like I guess that's [[01:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4h66bCg8Ldc&t=4380.22s)]
*  Part of it, but how else are you gonna get people to want to come? You know, like [[01:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4h66bCg8Ldc&t=4386.78s)]
*  I don't know. It's a difficult thing. But at the same time [[01:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4h66bCg8Ldc&t=4391.34s)]
*  If you're talking about someone like a matt rife where it's like you're doing crowd work [[01:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4h66bCg8Ldc&t=4394.14s)]
*  But half of the gag is that like people want you and I mean he's fallen from grace now totally and like has he oh, absolutely [[01:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4h66bCg8Ldc&t=4397.74s)]
*  My god, did you miss all this? No, I know that people accused him of something, but that seemed extra [[01:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4h66bCg8Ldc&t=4405.360000000001s)]
*  That seemed ridiculous to me kind of his whole [[01:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4h66bCg8Ldc&t=4410.56s)]
*  Comedy special was basically him saying I don't like having a primer primarily female audience [[01:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4h66bCg8Ldc&t=4414.64s)]
*  Uh, I want dudes to like my comedy and the whole like 30 minutes of his special are like I hate women [[01:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4h66bCg8Ldc&t=4421.68s)]
*  Like I fucking don't you hate it when bitches like it's horrible. I didn't know that [[01:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4h66bCg8Ldc&t=4429.200000000001s)]
*  Why would you alienate your audience like that? And that's what I think happens when it's like [[01:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4h66bCg8Ldc&t=4434.0s)]
*  You got famous from your crowd work and people liked you and women liked you. Why would you alienate the women? [[01:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4h66bCg8Ldc&t=4438.48s)]
*  Yeah, they're the ones that like really support you they buy merch they show up to the meet and greet [[01:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4h66bCg8Ldc&t=4443.92s)]
*  You know, they I don't know. Yeah, it was sad. Oh, it's interesting. I didn't know that [[01:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4h66bCg8Ldc&t=4448.88s)]
*  Is that a thing that people are is that like is this a thing going on nick? [[01:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4h66bCg8Ldc&t=4453.52s)]
*  Look, he called his fucking thing problematic. Like he's making a joke out of it. Is he topless? Oh, yeah [[01:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4h66bCg8Ldc&t=4456.56s)]
*  Yeah [[01:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4h66bCg8Ldc&t=4462.16s)]
*  Wow [[01:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4h66bCg8Ldc&t=4463.36s)]
*  He's nips out [[01:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4h66bCg8Ldc&t=4464.32s)]
*  I didn't know that there had been [[01:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4h66bCg8Ldc&t=4466.48s)]
*  This fall from grace. It's bad [[01:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4h66bCg8Ldc&t=4468.72s)]
*  Oh gosh [[01:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4h66bCg8Ldc&t=4471.28s)]
*  And to do that whole sort of rampage of like I want men to think i'm funny. Well, they don't brother [[01:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4h66bCg8Ldc&t=4472.639999999999s)]
*  So what what now? You know what? I mean, you lost your woman audience and your man audience [[01:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4h66bCg8Ldc&t=4478.8s)]
*  But he's still selling out dates. So I don't know maybe it's so then did he really then right? [[01:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4h66bCg8Ldc&t=4483.68s)]
*  How effective is or is this just right? [[01:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4h66bCg8Ldc&t=4488.48s)]
*  Oh, I don't think I think the best thing you can probably do is get canceled if it's for something that really means something to you [[01:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4h66bCg8Ldc&t=4491.44s)]
*  But if it's just somebody writing an article on some but yeah, I don't know. I didn't see the special [[01:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4h66bCg8Ldc&t=4497.84s)]
*  I didn't either [[01:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4h66bCg8Ldc&t=4503.28s)]
*  Oh, you didn't even see it. I saw clips. So I saw the first five minutes [[01:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4h66bCg8Ldc&t=4504.64s)]
*  No, I didn't watch the full thing because I was like this isn't funny. You know what I mean? [[01:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4h66bCg8Ldc&t=4508.32s)]
*  Yeah, it's not [[01:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4h66bCg8Ldc&t=4512.16s)]
*  Huh? I'm not rocking with it. Well, I feel like we should see i'll have to see it [[01:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4h66bCg8Ldc&t=4513.6s)]
*  but I didn't know that there that there was this fall from grace in the um, [[01:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4h66bCg8Ldc&t=4517.84s)]
*  like in the [[01:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4h66bCg8Ldc&t=4522.08s)]
*  Why is matt rife turned against his female audience? [[01:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4h66bCg8Ldc&t=4524.64s)]
*  If you've been on tiktok, you probably had matt rife pushed on you [[01:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4h66bCg8Ldc&t=4529.44s)]
*  But it's just people kind of [[01:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4h66bCg8Ldc&t=4534.72s)]
*  That he's entertaining. There's a lot of entertaining stuff man. He's got a lot of great stuff. Well, that's the whole thing is like [[01:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4h66bCg8Ldc&t=4536.96s)]
*  We're all entertainers, you know, and I think it's just about highlighting people who are [[01:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4h66bCg8Ldc&t=4542.72s)]
*  Genuinely, very funny and very original and very creative and like should have a netflix special [[01:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4h66bCg8Ldc&t=4547.5s)]
*  You know if your whole thing is predicated on controversy [[01:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4h66bCg8Ldc&t=4553.28s)]
*  Boring, don't care. You know, like I want to tell me a joke, right? [[01:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4h66bCg8Ldc&t=4557.12s)]
*  Yeah, that's interesting. I think is there a lot of like some people it feels like they create it's more about [[01:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4h66bCg8Ldc&t=4561.6s)]
*  I'm trying to think of people that it's more about controversy [[01:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4h66bCg8Ldc&t=4567.76s)]
*  Like what does that mean when you say that kind of well for him [[01:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4h66bCg8Ldc&t=4572.24s)]
*  I mean coming off of all the drama on tiktok that was when he was like and i'm here's my special [[01:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4h66bCg8Ldc&t=4575.12s)]
*  Oh, oh, I see what you're saying. I did. Yeah, I I missed I think a lot of that boat [[01:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4h66bCg8Ldc&t=4579.68s)]
*  I just knew that he was just on tour [[01:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4h66bCg8Ldc&t=4584.0s)]
*  And that the ladies loved him and we were talking like like five months ago [[01:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4h66bCg8Ldc&t=4586.88s)]
*  I remember talking about how he was like there's not a ton of like that handsome of a guy who gets to also do comedy [[01:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4h66bCg8Ldc&t=4590.16s)]
*  Um, it kind of works against you in comedy. Oh god being hot [[01:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4h66bCg8Ldc&t=4596.08s)]
*  Yeah, does it help you out? I needed you to look over at me. So [[01:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4h66bCg8Ldc&t=4601.12s)]
*  If I don't fucking just had a fucking oh god, if my mother would have fucked somebody with some cheekbones [[01:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4h66bCg8Ldc&t=4605.44s)]
*  I wouldn't even fucking worry about this shit if she'd have fucked one guy with a dimple in our town [[01:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4h66bCg8Ldc&t=4610.4s)]
*  Yeah, please [[01:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4h66bCg8Ldc&t=4615.92s)]
*  Yeah, yeah [[01:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4h66bCg8Ldc&t=4617.28s)]
*  And look, I know that guy didn't have dimples. I know it was an incident with a fucking can opener [[01:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4h66bCg8Ldc&t=4618.4s)]
*  But still mom bang that guy. Yeah. Oh [[01:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4h66bCg8Ldc&t=4622.96s)]
*  But no, I didn't know that that I didn't know that matt had that fall from [[01:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4h66bCg8Ldc&t=4627.12s)]

*  And now we're gonna ban it because why? [[01:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4h66bCg8Ldc&t=5144.96s)]

*  Good just getting older and the more you realize about the earth and the world and people where have you landed? [[02:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4h66bCg8Ldc&t=7806.8s)]
*  Yeah, I think I need a faith [[02:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4h66bCg8Ldc&t=7813.68s)]
*  Love that but not does it have to be nominal like christian or no, I think I I I I like prefer [[02:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4h66bCg8Ldc&t=7816.400000000001s)]
*  I don't know if I prefer is the word I use christianity because that's the thing i'm most familiar with sure [[02:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4h66bCg8Ldc&t=7823.76s)]
*  So I think I use a lot of those like kind of um symbols [[02:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4h66bCg8Ldc&t=7829.52s)]
*  You know, um [[02:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4h66bCg8Ldc&t=7835.06s)]
*  But I think yeah, it could be any [[02:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4h66bCg8Ldc&t=7837.22s)]
*  Way you used to find faith, you know and build a relationship with a higher power [[02:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4h66bCg8Ldc&t=7839.860000000001s)]
*  I just find that I just need it more and more [[02:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4h66bCg8Ldc&t=7844.34s)]
*  It's just too much strain. I just can't handle it. That's real unless I like [[02:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4h66bCg8Ldc&t=7846.74s)]
*  You know, i've been just trying to say like that will be done more often and say that as much as I can [[02:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4h66bCg8Ldc&t=7852.26s)]
*  it's just like [[02:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4h66bCg8Ldc&t=7857.3s)]
*  Suddenly like everything is not my responsibility [[02:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4h66bCg8Ldc&t=7859.22s)]
*  Yeah, because that's how I get to feeling like that everything in the world is my responsibility. Yeah weighs heavy [[02:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4h66bCg8Ldc&t=7861.46s)]
*  Oh, it just and it's it's just this weird stacking weight that you don't even realize is happening [[02:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4h66bCg8Ldc&t=7867.46s)]
*  Yeah, it's also self-inflicted like you did that to yourself, right? [[02:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4h66bCg8Ldc&t=7872.1s)]
*  And it used to be a good skill when I was a kid because I felt a lot of self-responsibility [[02:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4h66bCg8Ldc&t=7875.860000000001s)]
*  Like I have to take care of myself. So then it made sense. It was like everything is my responsibility [[02:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4h66bCg8Ldc&t=7880.66s)]
*  It feels like so I need to do that. But then as uh, as I got older, it's not this it's like [[02:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4h66bCg8Ldc&t=7885.54s)]
*  You're not a kid anymore. Just trying to get their little life done. Yeah now you're an adult. Everything is not your responsibility [[02:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4h66bCg8Ldc&t=7891.860000000001s)]
*  You know and it shouldn't [[02:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4h66bCg8Ldc&t=7898.26s)]
*  Feel that way all the time, you know [[02:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4h66bCg8Ldc&t=7900.42s)]
*  I like that. I like that. It's kind of outside the bounds of like [[02:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4h66bCg8Ldc&t=7903.06s)]
*  the church, but it's still [[02:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4h66bCg8Ldc&t=7906.5s)]
*  Familiar. I like that. Yeah, what do you feel about it? Oh, man, i'm i'm ex christian you are yeah [[02:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4h66bCg8Ldc&t=7908.820000000001s)]
*  Oh, you're rick you're [[02:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4h66bCg8Ldc&t=7915.06s)]
*  You were a christian I was I was raised in the baptist church. Oh really it's like well [[02:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4h66bCg8Ldc&t=7917.06s)]
*  baptist on my mom's side and [[02:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4h66bCg8Ldc&t=7922.9800000000005s)]
*  Pentecostal on my dad's side pentecostal they get wow they skirt it up. They get they skirt it up. They got uh, [[02:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4h66bCg8Ldc&t=7926.240000000001s)]
*  It's almost like amish sometimes [[02:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4h66bCg8Ldc&t=7932.26s)]
*  it's uh [[02:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4h66bCg8Ldc&t=7934.660000000001s)]
*  Speaking in tongues and like firing brimstone. So I feel like I have two extremes on both sides [[02:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4h66bCg8Ldc&t=7936.18s)]
*  and that's a weird way to come up because it's like [[02:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4h66bCg8Ldc&t=7940.900000000001s)]
*  especially as someone who's funny and [[02:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4h66bCg8Ldc&t=7943.9400000000005s)]
*  Has success which i'm so grateful for and i'm so fortunate [[02:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4h66bCg8Ldc&t=7946.900000000001s)]
*  To accredit that to a god and not me and what i've built [[02:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4h66bCg8Ldc&t=7952.1s)]
*  Is kind of where I struggle, you know where it's like all glory to this other thing, but [[02:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4h66bCg8Ldc&t=7957.860000000001s)]

*  And so much of it. I think it's chance tiktok happened at a certain time that I happened to be posting videos [[02:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4h66bCg8Ldc&t=7965.3s)]
*  I'm not more deserving than any other person. We just got lucky, you know [[02:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4h66bCg8Ldc&t=7971.06s)]
*  So I struggle with it sometimes of like i've been told that you need to look at the world this way, but I don't [[02:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4h66bCg8Ldc&t=7975.3s)]
*  So what do you do, you know, and I sometimes have trouble sleeping a night over it, but I don't miss the church [[02:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4h66bCg8Ldc&t=7982.02s)]
*  Yeah, you know, did you meet any men in the church? [[02:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4h66bCg8Ldc&t=7988.18s)]
*  They're very judgmental [[02:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4h66bCg8Ldc&t=7991.860000000001s)]
*  Are they yeah christian men are the first to shame you [[02:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4h66bCg8Ldc&t=7993.46s)]

*  Yeah, I think I got to the point where I just feel [[02:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4h66bCg8Ldc&t=8027.0599999999995s)]

*  women [[02:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4h66bCg8Ldc&t=8214.28s)]
*  Know more about men [[02:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4h66bCg8Ldc&t=8215.4s)]
*  Than men know about women because we've had to figure out how to live in a man's world [[02:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4h66bCg8Ldc&t=8218.28s)]
