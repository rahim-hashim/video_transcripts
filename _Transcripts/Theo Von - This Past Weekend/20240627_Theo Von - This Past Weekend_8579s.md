*  I love you. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=85.64s)]
*  I love you too. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=105.64s)]
*  I like your voice, man. I like your voice. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=106.64s)]
*  You do? [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=115.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=116.64s)]
*  Oh, thanks, man. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=117.64s)]
*  I'd like to speak like that. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=118.64s)]
*  Well, I think, well, it's interesting coming to London because you see where it started at. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=119.64s)]
*  Coming to London is very much like going and looking at the roots of [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=127.64s)]
*  America. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=133.64s)]
*  Yeah, and the English language. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=134.64s)]
*  And you probably know this, but they say Shakespeare, if he were alive today, would speak like kind of like an appellation. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=135.64s)]
*  He'd be a, I feel like he'd probably be a rapper or something now. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=143.64s)]
*  He'd probably be a rapper. He'd talk kind of like this. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=146.64s)]
*  Yeah, he'd be like, where the hoes at or whatever. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=148.64s)]
*  Because words like got, we say gotten in America or fall. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=151.64s)]
*  We say autumn. Those are, you know, in Shakespeare, he talked kind of like, it's a lot of fun talking to you, Théovon, [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=155.64s)]
*  because I'm kind of a stand up comedian too. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=163.64s)]
*  Oh, so he. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=165.64s)]
*  But I make plays. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=166.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=167.64s)]
*  But there is different characters on stage talking and stuff. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=168.64s)]
*  Are you serious, William? That sounds really. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=171.64s)]
*  Yeah. I love words. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=173.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=175.64s)]
*  It feels weird talking to you. Like it feels a little offensive like I'm talking to you. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=176.64s)]
*  No, I don't think so. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=179.64s)]
*  Well, I could hear everything that's wrong with what I'm doing, but to me it sounded perfect. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=180.64s)]
*  Well, it's funny because people will like joke about a white accent that's kind of country, [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=185.64s)]
*  but they don't like they don't. But if you do it about a black accent, it seems like it gets offensive. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=190.64s)]
*  You know? [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=196.64s)]
*  But I don't. This is OK. This is I don't use terms like I obviously I don't use racial slurs, but I don't say white trash. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=197.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=203.64s)]
*  For example. And that sounds like maybe pretty. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=204.64s)]
*  But I don't or I wouldn't use the term hillbilly. Does that make sense? [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=207.64s)]
*  Yeah, I think I don't feel like maybe because I came from a position of something like a little bit of privilege in life. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=212.64s)]
*  And it feels like like you're looking down on people. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=218.64s)]
*  Yeah. Well, I think it's like in the past eight years, I would say in the US, the like they made it so the only people they would make fun of anymore were kind of like poor white people or just white people kind of. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=222.64s)]
*  So they kind of stuck themselves in this place. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=236.64s)]
*  Yes. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=239.64s)]
*  I think it's one of the reasons why podcasting has had a rise over the years, because it still kept this just freedom of like, well, I'm not I'll just we'll talk about whatever we feel like we'll try to just be our normal self and say and actually be loose and free. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=240.64s)]
*  I used to in the 90s I worked with Michael Morris, the documentary maker. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=254.64s)]
*  So he was my mentor of a sort like he gave me my first job on TV. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=258.64s)]
*  I worked for a show called TV Nation in the mid 90s. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=261.64s)]
*  It was on NBC and then it was on Fox. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=264.64s)]
*  But it felt like because it was a very it was a left wing kind of politically engaged but it felt like the one thing we were okay as we as a collective on the show with making fun with making fun of was kind of white southerners. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=267.64s)]
*  Yeah. So it was like, oh well we're going to channel all that into just making fun of Billy Joel and Billy Bob and yeah and it always I always slightly felt like maybe this isn't okay. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=279.64s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=290.64s)]
*  Like the last acceptable taboo. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=291.64s)]
*  Right. Making fun of the dumb crackers. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=293.64s)]
*  Yeah, dude. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=295.64s)]
*  These damn dumb. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=296.64s)]
*  They don't know shit. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=297.64s)]
*  They're dumb as a stump. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=298.64s)]
*  They're drinking gasoline. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=299.64s)]
*  Yeah, right. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=301.64s)]
*  Making doughnuts. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=302.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=303.64s)]
*  Riding around thinking that's fun. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=304.64s)]
*  They're doing doughnuts in their sister's vagina. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=305.64s)]
*  Yeah, man. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=307.64s)]
*  That's the scariest place to do one. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=308.64s)]
*  But during for some reason there was like something in the past like eight years when it hit that that it people started to kind of get fed up with it in a way. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=310.64s)]
*  Or they just want equality. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=320.64s)]
*  They just want it will make fun of everybody. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=322.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=324.64s)]
*  Like don't just you know and I think some of that came with like the Trump stuff. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=325.64s)]
*  People thought that all Trump supporters were just like complete. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=329.64s)]
*  He'll you know. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=332.64s)]
*  He'll be ignorant. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=334.64s)]
*  And I think you see that a little bit in some of the stuff Sacha Baron Cohen did. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=335.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=341.64s)]
*  You ever watched like Borat and Bruno and it felt like. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=342.64s)]
*  It felt mean to me. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=346.64s)]
*  It felt a bit mean. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=347.64s)]
*  Sometimes. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=348.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=349.64s)]
*  When he was making fun of that he takes you remember this one. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=350.64s)]
*  It's kind of it's weird because sometimes you feel it's funny. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=352.64s)]
*  I feel I don't you know I don't want to be dumb. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=355.64s)]
*  He's funny and it felt a little bit like he was beating up on country folk. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=357.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=363.64s)]
*  You know what I mean. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=364.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=365.64s)]
*  I think I think as long as everybody's getting beaten up on it seems good. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=366.64s)]
*  And that's I think where I feel like things are kind of hedging back that way because there's nowhere else for them to go right now. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=370.64s)]
*  Man you're London is marvelous bro. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=377.64s)]
*  Oh you're welcome. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=379.64s)]
*  I didn't know I didn't think I really I was always kind of against the British like. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=381.64s)]
*  Come on really. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=385.64s)]
*  Yeah we're Polish and my father's from Nicaragua but his father was from Poland. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=386.64s)]
*  So my parent my father my grandfather met his wife in Nicaragua doing missionary work a long time ago. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=391.64s)]
*  So you're kind of Latin. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=399.64s)]
*  I'm Polish Nicaraguan. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=401.64s)]
*  That's kind of how I feel the most I guess. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=402.64s)]
*  Really. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=404.64s)]
*  Because my father was very like you know he would just talk in Spanish and drink small coffees and you know and probably think about you know dancing with women that weren't my mother doing the lambada. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=405.64s)]
*  Yes. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=417.64s)]
*  The forbidden dance. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=418.64s)]
*  But you were growing up in Covington and it must have been like you were quite exotic in those terms because that's a fairly like that's mainly white and a few black people right to be Nicaraguan. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=419.64s)]
*  Wouldn't that count for being a bit like. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=430.64s)]
*  Well yeah it even starts with N.I. you know so immediately we're getting kind of lumped in with the brothers. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=432.64s)]
*  And you can pass like you look pretty white to me. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=438.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=440.64s)]
*  I feel weird saying that just saying that felt uncomfortable like I was sounding like David Duke or something. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=441.64s)]
*  No I used to share a back fence with David Duke. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=446.64s)]
*  Did you? [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=448.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=449.64s)]

*  Yeah something. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=566.64s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=567.64s)]
*  I don't know how British to get. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=568.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=569.64s)]
*  So we ate a lot of like war meals. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=570.64s)]
*  A lot of the food here tastes like a lot of war meals I feel like. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=574.4s)]
*  Yes. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=577.64s)]
*  Which war? [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=578.64s)]
*  Like the second world war? [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=579.64s)]
*  I'm not sure. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=580.64s)]
*  I'll have to open it. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=581.64s)]
*  I'll have to check a reference. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=582.64s)]
*  Do you mean like so like it would be delicious if you were in a war? [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=583.64s)]
*  Yeah like it feels like somebody like hurried you into a tent to eat and this is what the [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=587.52s)]
*  chef had, the cook had. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=591.68s)]
*  You know like I'm half American. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=594.72s)]
*  My dad's from Boston, Massachusetts. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=595.96s)]
*  And so I feel a very divided loyalty like and I remember but at the same time because [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=600.04s)]
*  I grew up mainly in South London I would come to America to visit my relations. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=604.0799999999999s)]
*  Many of them lived around Boston or on Cape Cod with holiday on Cape Cod. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=608.98s)]
*  Oh fancy huh? [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=612.16s)]
*  If you know that very nice yeah. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=613.16s)]
*  How are ya? [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=614.16s)]
*  That's how they would. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=615.64s)]
*  How are ya? [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=616.76s)]
*  That's a different American accent. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=617.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=619.48s)]
*  It's wicked. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=620.48s)]
*  And so your American fan base is going to be like what the fuck is he doing? [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=621.48s)]
*  But my point was that when they would have stereotypes about British people or English [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=628.04s)]
*  people I would feel slightly offended because if you grow up in it you don't notice like [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=632.92s)]
*  oh the food's awful or the idea that English people will have bad teeth. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=637.84s)]
*  And I was like no we don't but actually we kind of certainly did then. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=643.64s)]
*  They're a little better now. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=647.88s)]
*  But yeah I'm interested in what you see from the outside. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=649.36s)]
*  So the food's not so good. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=651.4s)]
*  The food is not yet. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=653.08s)]
*  The food doesn't strike me. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=654.08s)]
*  This is one thing I noticed. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=656.96s)]
*  The women are, they seem to be neater women. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=658.04s)]
*  They seem to have more ambiance about them. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=664.04s)]
*  I think and this is no disrespect to America or anything. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=667.96s)]
*  America seems like a lot more kind of social media obsessed and like kind of fake tit kind [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=671.92s)]
*  of obsessed. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=680.4399999999999s)]
*  Whereas I feel like here some of the women just seem to have their own, more their own [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=682.3199999999999s)]
*  world to them. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=687.1999999999999s)]
*  Do you have a girlfriend? [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=688.1999999999999s)]
*  I don't have a girlfriend. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=690.36s)]
*  So you're out here down for whatever. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=691.36s)]

*  or whatever somebody. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=702.12s)]
*  What was the term? [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=703.12s)]
*  Traipser, somebody traipsing by or whatever. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=704.12s)]
*  Okay. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=706.3199999999999s)]
*  Yeah I'm not out here touching people or anything. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=707.3199999999999s)]

*  But I just think that some of the- [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=728.64s)]
*  Have you been out going out to clubs and bars? [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=729.64s)]
*  No no I don't go to clubs. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=732.0s)]

*  The drinks are expensive but they're very delicious. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=745.04s)]
*  Oh and the lamps even had, they didn't have like the little clicker on the back on the [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=747.08s)]
*  chord they had the actual- [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=750.92s)]
*  Right. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=752.4s)]

*  Yeah. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=755.12s)]

*  Like a bonafide lamp yeah. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=757.5999999999999s)]
*  Like that time, like it was like you know- [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=759.8s)]
*  Does that count for a lot? [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=761.0799999999999s)]
*  Like a string? [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=762.0799999999999s)]
*  That seems like a low bar for like formality. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=763.0799999999999s)]

*  It was so fancy that place. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=773.3199999999999s)]
*  They didn't even have switches. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=774.56s)]
*  They had lamps with little strings dangling off them. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=775.56s)]
*  Is it offensive if I do that? [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=778.5999999999999s)]
*  We can cut that out. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=779.7199999999999s)]
*  It's like your fans are going to be like, why'd you get that lamy on there and he just [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=781.52s)]
*  rolled you? [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=784.9200000000001s)]
*  No, I don't think so. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=785.9200000000001s)]
*  I'll let you know if it feels weird. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=787.9200000000001s)]
*  I think because we're talking about it, it's fine. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=789.5600000000001s)]
*  If somebody was being like, but I think that's something that happened in America. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=792.64s)]
*  It was like people were like, fuck you. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=796.52s)]
*  You'll try and sell us your television programming but you're, the only thing that's on it is [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=799.5600000000001s)]
*  you're only brave enough to make fun of us. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=804.24s)]
*  Like you're not even artistic anymore. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=806.9200000000001s)]
*  I think that's something that's happened a lot with like Hollywood is they become like [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=809.0799999999999s)]
*  fifth and sixth generation Hollywooders now. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=815.12s)]
*  They're not as accepting of like people coming in and bringing in different ideas. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=818.8s)]
*  It doesn't feel like a melting pot of ideas anymore. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=822.4399999999999s)]
*  It feels like the people that originally came there and had the ideas, some of that's kind [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=825.1999999999999s)]
*  of dissipated just by like nepotism and stuff like that sometimes. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=831.9599999999999s)]
*  Insularity, they're in a bubble. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=836.5999999999999s)]
*  I'll say like, you know, because I came up as a, you know, from the outward appearance [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=839.5999999999999s)]
*  as being British, but then I got my break in America working for Michael Moore and then [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=843.92s)]
*  I was doing stories. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=847.8s)]
*  First, one of the first stories I did was about the Ku Klux Klan and I was in- [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=848.8s)]
*  Yeah, I'm familiar with it. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=852.5999999999999s)]
*  Okay, Zink Arkansas and the show that I did or the phenomenon of the Klan or both? [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=853.5999999999999s)]
*  I'm familiar with the one, where's the part where the guy, you guys are at the house and [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=859.56s)]
*  they ask you if you're Jewish or the guy tries to bug you about it? [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=863.5999999999999s)]
*  Different one, because then it was like it worked. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=865.64s)]
*  So then that was also, I was with the neo-Nazis in California, but the first one was a guy [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=867.24s)]
*  called McAlo. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=871.0400000000001s)]
*  He lived in Waco, Texas. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=872.6s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=874.9200000000001s)]
*  And he said, no sir. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=875.9200000000001s)]
*  And it was the first time I encountered that southern thing of being called sir, but in [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=876.9200000000001s)]
*  a way that felt formal to the point of slightly unfriendly. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=881.4s)]
*  Yes sir, it's real nice. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=885.24s)]
*  Come over here, sir. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=887.48s)]
*  Like it could have felt like polite, but it felt like distancing. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=888.48s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=891.6800000000001s)]
*  No, just like that. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=892.6800000000001s)]
*  He was showing me all his signs and the sign, they were pretending not to be racist. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=893.76s)]
*  Oh yeah, I've seen this actually. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=897.2399999999999s)]
*  But they're in the Ku Klux Klan. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=898.7199999999999s)]
*  So he's leaving out this stuff and it says, and this is something, an atom we use for [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=899.7199999999999s)]
*  our world side sales and it's called for the discriminating shopper. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=903.5999999999999s)]
*  And it said discriminating in red. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=909.12s)]
*  And I go, but why does it say discriminating in red? [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=910.52s)]
*  It just like that because it's kind of stands out. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=915.04s)]
*  And I said, but does that mean you discriminate? [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=917.4399999999999s)]
*  He goes, no sir, we do not discriminate. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=919.0799999999999s)]
*  It was an odd thing, but the point I was going to get to was that when those shows go out [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=922.8s)]
*  in the US, I'm thinking like, I'm half American. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=927.44s)]
*  This isn't me making fun of American culture, but some people didn't see it that way. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=930.8s)]
*  And I always felt like a very divided, and I did one, I had one where I went around Miami [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=935.36s)]
*  mega jail, like the biggest, one of the biggest jails in the States. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=940.64s)]
*  Oh yeah, in Dade County. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=943.5600000000001s)]
*  Yeah, Miami Dade. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=944.5600000000001s)]
*  Four or five, four or even. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=945.5600000000001s)]
*  So you've seen this stuff. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=947.4s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=948.4s)]
*  I'm familiar. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=949.4s)]
*  I don't want you to think that I'm not familiar. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=950.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=951.56s)]
*  So I thought it was a good show, but then when it went out on Netflix, most, I guess [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=952.56s)]
*  most people, a lot of people liked it, but some of the comments were like from people, [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=957.12s)]
*  I think black people who are like, why is this white British guy going in kind of making [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=960.56s)]
*  us look bad, which it's a valid response, but it's definitely not how, how it was intended. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=965.0s)]
*  So I'm conscious of that feeling of being insider, but outsider as well. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=971.12s)]
*  Yeah, you know, it's fine. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=976.24s)]
*  I was thinking about that. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=977.24s)]
*  I wonder what it feels like, because once you kind of, as somebody who's coming to look [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=979.08s)]
*  at something and explore it and see how you can be a filter or like a kaleidoscope for [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=982.12s)]
*  the other people behind you that are going to watch it, what is that? [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=987.88s)]
*  Is it tough? [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=992.6800000000001s)]
*  Like at a certain point, do you become a bit of a jaded kaleidoscope? [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=993.86s)]
*  Do you become like a, do you like, yeah, how does your funnel change over time? [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=998.0s)]
*  Because of doing it more and more and because it garnered, also there's, it garners esteem. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=1004.44s)]
*  Yes. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=1010.1600000000001s)]
*  And so that's, it's just interesting how the different, how different factors can start [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=1011.1600000000001s)]
*  to affect the funnel. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=1014.44s)]
*  I think the best thing that's happened to me is that I'm not that well known in America [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=1015.44s)]
*  and you know, it's changed a little bit for various reasons. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=1020.6s)]
*  So I have a little bit of a profile, but I think the fact that I can go in where, if [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=1024.8400000000001s)]
*  I did a documentary in the UK, I'd be pretty well known. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=1029.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=1032.0s)]
*  I mean, you can still do it. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=1033.16s)]
*  In some ways it generates more goodwill because they're like, oh, we like Louie, we'll let [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=1034.16s)]
*  him in. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=1037.84s)]
*  And then off camera, you're maybe doing selfies and whatnot, which is fine. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=1038.84s)]
*  Although it kind of eats into your time a bit. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=1041.64s)]
*  You think I'm supposed to be a serious journalist, slightly flying under the radar and here I [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=1043.72s)]
*  am doing selfies at a riot. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=1048.12s)]
*  Do you know what I mean? [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=1049.84s)]
*  I'm like, I really need to be filming this right now. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=1050.84s)]
*  So sorry, someone's being arrested over there. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=1053.16s)]
*  Oh, just a quick selfie. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=1055.16s)]
*  Come on, mate. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=1056.44s)]
*  And then in America, however, I'm just, I'm going around Miami jail. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=1057.52s)]
*  No one's going to ask me for a selfie there. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=1060.64s)]
*  Do you know what I mean? [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=1062.36s)]
*  And I love that part. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=1063.36s)]
*  And I never get jaded as long as I feel I'm meeting new people. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=1064.36s)]
*  The only times where I felt like the dynamic changes is if I go back and do a follow up [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=1068.12s)]
*  a couple of times. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=1071.7199999999998s)]
*  So I did a story about the Westboro Baptist Church. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=1072.9599999999998s)]
*  Yeah, I'm familiar. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=1075.08s)]
*  That's in Louisiana, right? [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=1076.08s)]
*  It's in Kansas, Topeka, Topeka, Kansas. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=1077.08s)]
*  I think we have a branch in Louisiana. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=1080.6799999999998s)]
*  I don't think so. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=1082.9199999999998s)]
*  Really? [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=1083.9199999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=1084.9199999999998s)]
*  They don't really do branches. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=1085.9199999999998s)]
*  It's really just a one stop shop. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=1087.24s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=1090.0s)]
*  Unless there's obviously crazy, I use the term crazy advisedly, but there's other outfits. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=1091.16s)]
*  There's strange churches. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=1097.68s)]
*  But with Westboro, there's only, as far as I'm aware, there's only ever been one of the [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=1099.0s)]
*  guys left and moved to Louisiana. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=1103.4s)]
*  I wonder if that's what you're thinking about. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=1105.16s)]
*  I thought they had a Ford operating base or something in Louisiana. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=1106.16s)]
*  Maybe. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=1108.64s)]
*  Like a little beach head. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=1109.64s)]
*  Yeah, like a... [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=1110.64s)]
*  That's deployed from here. [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=1111.64s)]
*  So when I went back and did the first one, I'm like, hello. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=1114.76s)]
*  How does it work? [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=1117.2s)]
*  Nice to meet you. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=1118.2s)]
*  So you carry these signs. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=1119.2s)]
*  What's that all about? [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=1120.36s)]
*  And then you made the program. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=1121.9599999999998s)]
*  And then I went and made a follow up. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=1123.52s)]
*  And when you go back, they kind of have your number. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=1125.4199999999998s)]
*  And I don't mean number as in like, they know you're a prankster or making fun of them. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=1127.7199999999998s)]
*  It's more like they just know who you are. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=1131.52s)]
*  Right. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=1134.08s)]
*  So they don't put up with any nonsense and you know who they are. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=1135.08s)]
*  So the point, the word you used was jaded. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=1137.36s)]
*  You get a little jaded and that creates a different energy. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=1139.7199999999998s)]
*  So you are sort of saying, come on, just stop it. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=1142.3999999999999s)]
*  It's racist or it's homophobic. [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=1146.1599999999999s)]
*  It's antisemitic. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=1148.24s)]
*  You just cut to the chase quicker, which you know, you have no camouflage. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=1149.52s)]
*  So it doesn't make it impossible to do work. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=1156.28s)]
*  So as long as I'm on a new story, even if it's a related story to something like, if [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=1159.52s)]
*  you put me in a prison in the US tomorrow, I'd be a very happy person. [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=1164.72s)]
*  Wow. [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=1169.64s)]
*  So you like that sort of, you like being the princess and the P, you like being the P under [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=1170.64s)]
*  the mattress kind of? [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=1174.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=1176.04s)]
*  Yeah, kind of. [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=1177.04s)]
*  I'm working with that metaphor. [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=1178.04s)]
*  I'm waiting for it to make sense. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=1179.84s)]
*  But yes, like maybe I'm the princess in the sense that I love that fairy tale, by the [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=1180.84s)]
*  way. [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=1185.84s)]
*  You remember how it works? [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=1186.84s)]
*  Like she's, she stops the night and she says, I'm a princess. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=1187.84s)]
*  And they say, we don't believe you. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=1190.84s)]
*  And they say, here's how you test. [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=1192.68s)]
*  And they don't say anything to her. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=1193.84s)]
*  They say, get a P. Am I, you remember how? [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=1194.84s)]
*  And they put like a hundred mattresses. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=1197.56s)]
*  No, this helps. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=1198.56s)]
*  They put all the mattresses. [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=1199.56s)]
*  Like a ton. [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=1200.56s)]
*  And the next one, they say, how did you sleep? [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=1201.56s)]
*  And they said, I slept terrible. [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=1202.56s)]
*  And then what? [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=1203.56s)]
*  I was tossing and turning all night because the one P. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=1204.56s)]
*  But the point is a point about, oh, she really was a princess because she could feel a P. [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=1209.88s)]
*  I mean, it sounds kind of like a nightmare, right? [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=1212.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=1214.52s)]
*  Well, I grew up, yeah, I definitely, I used to have those buzzer underwear that would shock [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=1215.52s)]
*  you if you peed at night. [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=1218.3600000000001s)]
*  I heard about that. [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=1219.3600000000001s)]
*  But also- [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=1220.3600000000001s)]
*  It didn't shock you, you just buzzed, surely. [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=1221.3600000000001s)]
*  It was pretty strong. [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=1223.22s)]
*  The voltage we got- [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=1224.22s)]
*  You went through a lot growing up. [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=1225.22s)]
*  We got a pretty high voltage package, I think. [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=1226.88s)]
*  My mom wanted me to fucking feel it. [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=1228.8400000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=1230.88s)]
*  I got them for Christmas. [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=1231.88s)]
*  It was a gift, I remember. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=1232.88s)]
*  And it was kind of fun because you would be able to like just sprinkle some water on them [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=1233.88s)]
*  and turn them on, you know? [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=1236.64s)]
*  And so my brother would be like, do the thing, you know, and I would do it. [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=1238.6s)]
*  But- [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=1241.68s)]
*  Do they still sell those? [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=1242.68s)]
*  Oh, I don't know. [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=1243.68s)]
*  That's a good question. [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=1245.04s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=1246.04s)]
*  I need to look into that. [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=1247.04s)]
*  I think having the electricity in the pool of urine was a bad, it was a very 80s, 90s [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=1249.68s)]
*  thing. [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=1257.96s)]
*  But no, I mean, you're like, you're the P actually that gets put in, like you're the [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=1258.96s)]
*  thing that has an effect on these. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=1263.12s)]
*  I see. [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=1265.12s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=1266.12s)]
*  I mean, I think that's the effect of being, of mixing things up. [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=1267.9599999999998s)]
*  And yeah, I very much, I do like that. [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=1270.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=1272.7199999999998s)]
*  I don't know what else to say about that. [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=1273.7199999999998s)]
*  Yeah, like how did that ever start in you that you desired, like- [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=1275.7199999999998s)]
*  Okay, I like invisibility and I'm an anxious person. [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=1278.8s)]
*  And because I grew up always worrying about things, I felt if I was talking to someone [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=1282.36s)]
*  who seemed off-beam or just in any way like their mind worked differently, like I was, [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=1288.8799999999999s)]
*  all kids are like this, but I was the kid who, if there was a homeless person with his [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=1295.52s)]
*  mouth open and I was like five or six years old, I'd be like, what's going on with that? [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=1299.12s)]
*  Mom, why is that man got his mouth open? [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=1304.6s)]
*  What, mom? [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=1306.9199999999998s)]
*  And they're like, shh, things you're not supposed to talk about, don't talk about. [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=1307.9199999999998s)]
*  Or if you read about just weird stuff happening, like guys falling asleep and then burning [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=1311.8s)]
*  to death because they were in the sun and they were wearing too much sun oil. [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=1319.2s)]
*  And I'd be like, what does that feel like? [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=1322.52s)]
*  I was just kind of, I think there were aspects of life that felt so strange it took me out [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=1324.6s)]
*  of myself and whatever inner voices of anxiety and disquiet I had, they were silenced. [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=1329.0s)]
*  Does that make sense? [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=1336.0s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, it's interesting. [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=1337.0s)]
*  And so if you're on location, you're going and talking to someone who, like the first [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=1338.0s)]
*  story I ever did was for Michael Moore and it was called Millennium and it was about [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=1341.36s)]
*  people who think the end of the world is about to happen. [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=1344.84s)]
*  And my main anxiety was I'm going to be terrible at being on TV, right? [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=1347.52s)]
*  I just didn't think I had whatever that gift is. [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=1352.68s)]
*  Like I was very nervous. [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=1355.2800000000002s)]
*  I thought, I know, I was thinking, I know at least five people who are way, who would [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=1356.2800000000002s)]
*  be way better at this than me. [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=1360.72s)]
*  Like my best friends were all really funny people I grew up with who went on to be comedians [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=1362.0800000000002s)]
*  and talented performers, right? [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=1365.68s)]
*  And I'm thinking I'm the least funny one in my friendship group. [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=1367.96s)]
*  And yet I was 23 years old and I'd been given this break. [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=1371.24s)]
*  And the only thing I had that I was clinging onto that I thought, but I'm going to take [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=1374.3600000000001s)]
*  this opportunity of being a correspondent on this new show because I want to meet these [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=1378.0s)]
*  people who are part of these crazy cults who think the world is about to end. [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=1384.44s)]
*  I just thought that does sound like, that sounds fascinating and I will enjoy that part [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=1389.08s)]
*  of it. [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=1394.64s)]
*  And maybe enjoying speaking to them, they'll get some usable footage. [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=1395.64s)]
*  And that was really the launch pad. [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=1399.92s)]
*  Like was the fact that I just want to know, like, why, why do you think that? [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=1401.64s)]
*  What part of you, you know, like when is it going to all happen? [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=1405.8s)]
*  When is Jesus coming back and what will he be wearing? [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=1408.8s)]
*  And is that a Tuesday or a Wednesday and the concrete data or the UFO? [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=1411.28s)]
*  There were four different groups and there was a UFO group. [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=1414.52s)]
*  They were landing in Southern California, the spaceships were going to land in 2001. [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=1417.8799999999999s)]
*  And then there was a group in Western Montana who were a part of a neo-Nazi outfit who were [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=1423.6399999999999s)]
*  little Nazi uniforms. [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=1430.1599999999999s)]
*  And I remember it was day three, first two days it went terrible. [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=1432.0400000000002s)]
*  It went terrible. [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=1434.68s)]
*  Like I thought- [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=1435.8400000000001s)]
*  With the neo-Nazis you mean? [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=1437.8400000000001s)]
*  No, day one was Harold Camping. [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=1438.8400000000001s)]
*  He was a fundamentalist Christian who talked like this. [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=1441.44s)]
*  And then Jesus is going to come back, see? [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=1444.48s)]
*  And then day two was a UFO group and they were all kind of touchy-feely, like, we're [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=1446.8000000000002s)]
*  not preaching doom and gloom. [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=1452.0400000000002s)]
*  We're not fearful at all. [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=1453.64s)]
*  But it was kind of like they kept talking. [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=1455.68s)]
*  Like I just didn't feel like I was clicking with them. [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=1457.2s)]
*  They talked too much basically. [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=1460.24s)]
*  And I was too polite and scared to interrupt. [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=1461.8400000000001s)]
*  But then day three, the Nazis bizarrely were the most polite and the most sort of emotionally [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=1464.3600000000001s)]
*  available. [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=1471.24s)]
*  Does that make sense? [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=1472.24s)]
*  So they were just, I think they were just so lonely and so bored, like two guys living [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=1473.44s)]
*  in a trailer in Western Montana. [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=1479.0s)]
*  The me arriving and they're like, come on in. [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=1481.16s)]
*  So great to have you. [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=1485.68s)]
*  You know, there's a lot of truth in the prophecies that are written up in Star Wars. [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=1486.68s)]
*  And what about Star Trek? [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=1490.48s)]
*  Star Trek is another one. [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=1492.8799999999999s)]
*  A lot of truth in that. [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=1494.04s)]
*  Different planets for different races. [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=1495.56s)]
*  And I thought like I was, I didn't want to talk too much about myself because I thought [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=1497.6799999999998s)]
*  they'd probably assume I was Jewish because a lot of people assume I'm Jewish and I thought [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=1502.36s)]
*  that would lead to an interesting dynamic. [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=1505.6s)]
*  So and it was just really striking how they were just thrilled to be telling the good [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=1508.36s)]
*  news about different races going to different planets and how there was this neo-Nazi cosmic [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=1514.96s)]
*  vision. [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=1520.24s)]
*  And I just sort of go like, wow, that's fascinating. [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=1521.24s)]
*  Tell me more. [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=1523.4s)]
*  And in the ambience of kind of weird, I don't want to say friendship, but this sort of weird [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=1524.72s)]
*  feeling of warmth that infused the room and the ludicrousness of what they were saying, [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=1530.76s)]
*  I thought, okay, I can do this. [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=1537.04s)]
*  Like I can do my job. [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=1538.76s)]
*  Right. [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=1539.76s)]
*  This is funny and interesting. [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=1540.76s)]
*  And that's cool. [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=1542.76s)]
*  And I thought that was it. [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=1543.76s)]
*  I can now, not only did I think I've got this, I thought like I'm one of the greatest TV [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=1544.76s)]
*  performers of all time. [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=1548.4s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=1549.4s)]
*  It went like that. [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=1550.4s)]
*  I was like, this isn't a segment. [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=1551.4s)]
*  This is a feature film. [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=1554.24s)]
*  And in fact, Michael Moore better watch out because I'm way bigger than that. [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=1556.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=1562.36s)]
*  Oh, it's wild. [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=1563.36s)]
*  Three days in, three days in. [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=1564.36s)]
*  Of course. [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=1565.36s)]
*  I'm too big for this. [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=1566.36s)]
*  So why don't your ego will kind of be the thing that coerces you, that tickles you enough [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=1567.9599999999998s)]
*  and prods you enough to even get on stage. [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=1573.84s)]
*  And the second you open your mouth, then it jumps right in front of you and fucking thinks [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=1575.9199999999998s)]
*  you're Katy Perry or somebody or Ben and Nick Arnold or whatever. [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=1580.6799999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=1583.8799999999999s)]
*  I don't have a middle range. [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=1584.8799999999999s)]
*  Like I'm either, this is a disaster or I smashed it. [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=1585.8799999999999s)]
*  Same. [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=1591.04s)]
*  That's probably pretty normal. [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=1592.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=1593.04s)]
*  I think it's, you know, I go to like 12 step recovery and there's a term in there. [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=1594.72s)]
*  It's always like, I'm the ego maniac with an inferiority complex. [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=1599.44s)]
*  That's a big term that people say in there. [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=1604.8s)]
*  It's terrible when you say something about you think it's unique and it turns out not [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=1606.56s)]
*  only is it not unique, like it's a cliche. [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=1610.0s)]
*  My personality type is actually a cliche. [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=1613.36s)]
*  That's kind of disappointing. [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=1617.0s)]
*  Pretty chill. [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=1618.0s)]
*  It seems that's when you realize maybe we are all already AIs, you know, like we are [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=1619.96s)]
*  in a sim. [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=1626.4s)]
*  Well, I think there's nothing original about me or you, maybe you, but not me. [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=1627.4s)]
*  Well that's not very fair to put it on me since you made it so sullen, but I will say [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=1632.72s)]
*  this dude. [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=1637.16s)]
*  One time Joe Rogan said, I was talking with him and I'm not name dropping. [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=1638.16s)]
*  I know you've been over there before. [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=1641.92s)]
*  He said, you know, there's, there's many of us out there. [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=1644.08s)]
*  There's like seven Theo Vans. [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=1648.2800000000002s)]
*  There's like seven Louis Theroux. [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=1651.88s)]
*  There's like a whole, there's like, there's just happening at the same time. [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=1655.24s)]
*  And I don't know if I believe it. [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=1660.76s)]
*  And one of them is Asian and a couple of them are probably in Africa, which is crazy to [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=1661.76s)]
*  think about. [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=1665.96s)]
*  Right. [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=1666.96s)]
*  It is. [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=1667.96s)]
*  But I don't know if I believe that because it takes away some of your own like sense [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=1668.96s)]
*  of being value to yourself. [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=1672.7800000000002s)]
*  That was one of the reasons why I've never said this before. [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=1675.84s)]
*  I don't think, but when I went to America, I felt able to be on TV because I thought, [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=1678.88s)]
*  well, there's not many people like me here, you know, and I could be the British guy. [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=1685.04s)]
*  Whereas in, in the UK and certainly in London, I feel like there's hundreds of guys who are [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=1690.04s)]
*  just like me. [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=1695.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=1696.44s)]
*  Do you know what I mean? [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=1697.44s)]
*  Whereas you actually, uh, you've, you carved a path for yourself surrounded by people who [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=1698.44s)]
*  are somewhat probably somewhat similar. [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=1702.32s)]
*  There's other versions of you out there, but you're the best. [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=1704.72s)]
*  You must be the best one because you rose to the top. [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=1707.24s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=1710.04s)]
*  I mean, I don't know if sometimes why I've had been like had success in this business [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=1711.04s)]
*  or been fortunate. [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=1715.38s)]
*  Like I just hated not having a lot of opportunity I felt like. [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=1716.88s)]
*  And then when podcasting came along, it felt like you could just do what you, you could [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=1722.08s)]
*  just be yourself. [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=1725.76s)]
*  You know, that's what felt. [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=1727.6200000000001s)]
*  And it's like, yeah, I don't know. [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=1729.4s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=1731.8s)]
*  I've been like a slow evolver in life. [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=1732.8799999999999s)]
*  I'm kind of a slow learner and like a late of all of our kind of, and so. [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=1734.52s)]
*  Are you still fasting? [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=1738.44s)]
*  No. [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=1740.96s)]
*  Because you were fasting for a time. [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=1742.8799999999999s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=1745.24s)]
*  I've passed it for a time. [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=1746.24s)]
*  I almost bit into a damn employee at a, um, at a Best Buy or Costco. [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=1747.24s)]
*  It was Best Buy. [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=1751.24s)]
*  I don't go to Costco. [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=1752.24s)]
*  Why not? [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=1753.24s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=1754.24s)]
*  Is there a difference? [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=1755.24s)]
*  I don't like seeing that much food at once. [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=1756.24s)]
*  Because just too tempting. [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=1759.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=1762.3200000000002s)]
*  Makes me feel sad. [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=1763.3200000000002s)]
*  Have you been to Aldi since you've been here? [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=1764.3200000000002s)]
*  Aldi, the supermarket? [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=1766.3200000000002s)]
*  No. [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=1767.72s)]
*  Everything's cheap. [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=1768.72s)]
*  You can't spend more than 50 pounds if you try. [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=1769.72s)]
*  It's wild because you need self checkout. [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=1772.2s)]
*  So you have a little plastic bin and it's a discount retailer, but you, you, you, you [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=1774.8000000000002s)]
*  don't, you don't get a whole cart like a trolley. [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=1780.24s)]
*  Like you have to pull down a little plastic thing around. [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=1783.28s)]
*  And then when you get to, you check out and you're boop, you know, you do the self checkout, [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=1786.0800000000002s)]
*  but the barcodes are really big. [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=1789.76s)]
*  So it's not too difficult. [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=1791.32s)]
*  Is this making sense? [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=1792.32s)]
*  Yeah, a hundred percent. [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=1793.32s)]
*  Because if you self checkout, you don't want to be fussing with the tiny barcode. [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=1794.32s)]
*  You pass it right five times. [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=1798.04s)]
*  It's driving you insane, right? [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=1799.56s)]
*  But the big boop and then the bin's not that big. [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=1801.3999999999999s)]
*  It's pretty big, but you pile it up and then you could get as much in there as possible. [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=1804.54s)]
*  And it's like 50 pounds. [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=1808.4399999999998s)]
*  Oh, wow. [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=1809.4399999999998s)]
*  It's wild. [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=1810.4399999999998s)]
*  I mean, it's not wild, but you save so if you're, if you're thrifty as I am, you save [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=1811.4399999999998s)]
*  a lot of money. [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=1815.08s)]
*  You know, we had a great experience working with Morgan and Morgan. [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=1816.44s)]
*  We had a lawsuit or file a court filings against us by a kind of a hitchhiker. [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=1820.56s)]
*  You know that and it took a while, but Morgan and Morgan saw it through and we are in the [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=1827.88s)]
*  clear now. [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=1833.24s)]
*  I want to let you know that Morgan and Morgan is America's largest injury law firm. [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=1834.24s)]
*  They have over 100 offices nationwide and more than 800 lawyers with over 15 billion [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=1839.46s)]

*  And then, and then the mother of all terrible drugs, which was the oxys and whatever. [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=2297.52s)]
*  And and a lot of them live in Stade now, apparently, you know, Stade in Switzerland, [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=2302.48s)]
*  like it's a playground of the of the wealthy. [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=2307.96s)]
*  Of the wealthy that are hiding from. [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=2310.8399999999997s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=2312.44s)]
*  Wow. [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=2313.3599999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=2313.92s)]
*  That'd be a good documentary. [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=2314.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=2315.24s)]
*  If you could get in there, they probably don't want to speak. [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=2315.64s)]
*  And then it must be tougher. [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=2318.16s)]
*  The museums are all having to give the money back and take down, you know, because they [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=2319.24s)]
*  made all these donations. [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=2323.2799999999997s)]
*  Right. [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=2324.56s)]
*  But it's it's I think you're right. [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=2325.48s)]
*  I think the sense of betrayal and the way in which the way in which it was cynically [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=2326.92s)]
*  rolled out and the way in which doctors were induced to overprescribe and legislators [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=2332.64s)]
*  were persuaded. [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=2338.56s)]
*  Yeah, that's sales reps were all incentivized to make inappropriate. [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=2339.7599999999998s)]
*  I mean, everyone knows this now, but it was way worse than the pandemic. [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=2344.72s)]
*  Right. [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=2348.96s)]
*  Like in terms of like the loss of life. [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=2349.36s)]
*  Unbelievably worse. [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=2351.72s)]
*  And to think that it was yet to think that it didn't even hit that big of a crescendo. [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=2353.2s)]
*  I've never taken it. [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=2357.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=2358.96s)]
*  Have you? [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=2359.2799999999997s)]
*  I've never taken it. [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=2359.7599999999998s)]
*  I'm afraid. [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=2361.6s)]
*  Ventenol. [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=2362.2799999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=2363.2799999999997s)]
*  You got that good ventenol. [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=2363.6s)]
*  God, they got it. [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=2365.04s)]
*  That fanny they call it. [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=2365.92s)]
*  Is it? [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=2367.32s)]
*  That Fenty. [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=2368.24s)]
*  People just, yeah, just lay there. [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=2369.7999999999997s)]
*  And then car fentanyl. [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=2371.6s)]
*  It's like each one. [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=2372.7599999999998s)]
*  You know about car fentanyl? [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=2373.36s)]
*  That's the elephant tranquilizer. [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=2374.88s)]
*  It's like, it's a hundred times stronger. [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=2376.4s)]
*  A hundred times. [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=2379.2400000000002s)]
*  Then fentanyl and fentanyl. [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=2382.2400000000002s)]
*  If you touch it, you can overdose. [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=2383.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=2385.92s)]
*  Well, you don't even have to take it. [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=2386.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=2387.8s)]
*  And so police officers are bagging it up and then keeling over saying, this is the [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=2388.2400000000002s)]
*  best day of my life. [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=2392.4s)]
*  It's a sad, awful and then, or inhaling it right. [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=2395.8s)]
*  When they used to break into meth labs and then there was like the officers were [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=2399.64s)]
*  getting, you're a keeling over because they weren't wearing gas masks. [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=2403.72s)]
*  You remember all of that? [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=2407.24s)]
*  Some of them weren't doing it on purpose. [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=2407.92s)]
*  I bet after that first day, they're like, yeah, I'm leaving this at home. [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=2409.2799999999997s)]
*  I'll be back. [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=2412.84s)]
*  You leave this one for me. [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=2413.7999999999997s)]
*  I'll bag it up. [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=2414.64s)]
*  You get on with the next hit. [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=2415.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=2417.32s)]
*  No, it's, it's awful that car and then car fentanyl a hundred times. [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=2417.56s)]
*  It might be 10 times. [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=2421.04s)]
*  Even if it's one time. [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=2422.04s)]
*  Do you have a guy who can Google? [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=2423.4s)]
*  Have you got a Google guy? [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=2424.64s)]
*  Like Joe does? [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=2425.64s)]
*  He can do it right over there. [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=2426.72s)]
*  He's an import. [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=2428.6s)]
*  Who's Joe's Joe's Google Jamie. [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=2429.56s)]
*  Get Jamie. [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=2431.84s)]
*  Jamie, can you check that? [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=2432.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=2434.32s)]
*  Can you bring that up, dude? [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=2434.52s)]
*  Black people in wishing wells. [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=2436.2400000000002s)]
*  Is that what you were looking for? [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=2438.08s)]
*  He's always at the car fentanyl is like a, I think it's a hundred times stronger. [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=2441.6400000000003s)]
*  That's it's like, what are we doing? [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=2446.84s)]
*  How could we? [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=2449.76s)]
*  I think at that point people were like, no. [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=2450.96s)]
*  And so that on when after that happened and then COVID happened, [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=2453.48s)]
*  that's one of the huge reasons nobody trusted any of the pharmaceutical industry. [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=2457.88s)]
*  Because everybody just seen, I have four friends that died from fentanyl, right? [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=2462.04s)]
*  Seriously. [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=2465.88s)]
*  So what do you got? [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=2466.48s)]
*  Absolutely deceased. [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=2467.92s)]
*  People you grew up with. [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=2468.92s)]
*  Off the face of the earth. [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=2469.76s)]
*  Some from adulthood, but some from childhood, right? [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=2471.28s)]
*  Gone. [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=2474.44s)]
*  That's just me. [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=2474.8s)]
*  And I don't even run in those circles. [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=2475.52s)]
*  So I can't even, so once COVID happened and then it became like, Oh, we're going [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=2477.56s)]
*  to trust a pharmaceutical fuck. [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=2483.0s)]
*  No, that's where a lot of America was. [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=2485.7200000000003s)]
*  I think a lot of people don't talk about that, but to me that was a huge link. [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=2487.68s)]
*  Um, that's why car fentanyl. [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=2492.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=2495.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=2497.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=2497.32s)]
*  You shouldn't be in a car. [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=2497.88s)]
*  First of all, if you're in a car, it's nothing to do with being in a car, right? [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=2498.68s)]
*  It's called car fentanyl. [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=2504.88s)]
*  Well, then that's a strange name. [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=2506.52s)]
*  It is a strange, but yeah, yeah, but yeah, yeah. [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=2508.84s)]
*  It's so strong. [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=2512.52s)]
*  It's for cars. [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=2513.2799999999997s)]
*  No, it isn't that it's. [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=2514.84s)]
*  God damn. [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=2516.04s)]
*  I saw, I just saw a couple of tow trucks doing, yeah, that's not what it is. [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=2516.6400000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=2522.0s)]
*  It's for elephants. [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=2522.2400000000002s)]
*  They should call it something else. [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=2523.08s)]
*  It's confusing. [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=2524.36s)]
*  Oh, it's wild though. [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=2525.6800000000003s)]
*  Dude, but yeah, those pills are. [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=2527.52s)]
*  Can I ask because this is intrusive, so you must feel, but you're in the fellowship. [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=2528.76s)]
*  Are you allowed to talk about that? [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=2533.7200000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=2535.08s)]
*  I mean, I was on cocaine was my deal. [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=2535.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=2538.12s)]
*  I liked a little bit of cocaine and, um, yeah, I liked cocaine, you know, like if [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=2538.52s)]
*  you would have some cocaine, then I would have some hopefully. [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=2544.04s)]
*  If I had some now, what would you say? [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=2548.8s)]
*  I would say we'll take a break boys. [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=2551.16s)]
*  No, cause you're in recovery. [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=2554.68s)]
*  I'm in recovery. [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=2555.84s)]
*  No, I would say I would look at it. [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=2556.32s)]
*  I'd make sure it's cocaine. [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=2558.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=2559.32s)]
*  And then I'd probably hand it back to you. [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=2559.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=2561.56s)]
*  And then a few minutes later though, here's what I would do a few minutes later. [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=2561.92s)]
*  I'd say, let me look at it again. [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=2565.2s)]
*  How, how, how long are you clean? [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=2567.36s)]
*  What's the term? [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=2569.52s)]
*  How many days clean are you? [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=2570.08s)]

*  21 units or 28. [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=2593.2s)]
*  It doesn't see, it doesn't seem like very many. [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=2595.04s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=2598.08s)]

*  21 beers a week. [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=2603.68s)]
*  Yeah, that isn't 21 beers a week. [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=2604.7999999999997s)]
*  That would be a good week for me. [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=2608.52s)]
*  Okay. [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=2610.3599999999997s)]

*  No, no, I think, and it's more of the culture in the UK. [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=2639.4s)]
*  It's way more of the culture. [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=2642.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=2644.2s)]

*  It was too much war, too much quickly moving. [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=2654.16s)]
*  They like a drink. [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=2656.2400000000002s)]
*  We like Scotland. [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=2656.96s)]
*  They like a drink England and this it's what is, what do we say about it? [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=2657.88s)]
*  Um, my wife says I drink too much. [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=2661.88s)]
*  I disagree, but they have to say that. [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=2665.2000000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=2667.0800000000004s)]
*  They're taught to say that as soon as they're born. [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=2667.92s)]
*  Do you think so? [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=2669.92s)]
*  Your husband's going to drink too much. [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=2670.5200000000004s)]
*  You tell him. [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=2672.0s)]
*  I think she eats too many crisps. [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=2672.32s)]
*  Well, I think it's very chips. [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=2673.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=2676.28s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=2676.6400000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=2677.44s)]
*  But I would never dream of saying that to her. [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=2678.1600000000003s)]
*  No, she knows. [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=2680.5600000000004s)]
*  I think it every now and then you can't say that. [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=2681.4s)]
*  Why is she allowed to say you drink too much, but I can't say, I think you eat [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=2684.1200000000003s)]
*  too many crisps, I can, everyone, all the women are going to be like, [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=2687.2000000000003s)]
*  I used to like him and now I don't. [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=2691.88s)]
*  No, the women love you. [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=2693.7200000000003s)]
*  Any woman I've mentioned you to, they absolutely love you. [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=2694.88s)]
*  But then they'll feel like he's coercive. [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=2697.0s)]
*  He's trying to stop Nancy from eating those chips. [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=2698.5200000000004s)]
*  What's his problem with Nancy eating chips? [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=2702.1200000000003s)]
*  I, she, I think it's, um, as you get older, do you find that you speak [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=2704.28s)]
*  like women's language a little better? [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=2708.84s)]
*  Like, I feel like I understand more empathetic with women. [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=2711.8s)]
*  You just, there's certain things, you know, that you just, you don't ever say, [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=2714.6800000000003s)]
*  um, you just should never say. [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=2717.76s)]
*  A hundred percent. [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=2720.1200000000003s)]
*  Do you, do you definitely want to eat that? [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=2720.68s)]
*  Just never say that. [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=2723.12s)]
*  You should not even look at a piece of their food. [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=2724.44s)]
*  No. [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=2726.7599999999998s)]
*  Well, they look surprised or be like seconds. [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=2727.96s)]
*  Wow. [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=2730.7999999999997s)]
*  Really? [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=2731.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=2731.64s)]
*  Never do that. [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=2732.12s)]
*  Also, if they say, uh, do I look good in this or in this, you say you look amazing [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=2733.56s)]
*  in both, right? [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=2739.6s)]
*  You, you know all this. [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=2741.68s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=2742.7599999999998s)]
*  Well, I think as you get older, you just become, if you look at a senior citizen, [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=2743.64s)]
*  most of them could be a man or a woman. [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=2747.48s)]
*  They often evolve into the same haircut. [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=2749.72s)]
*  Your, your gender really seem that old. [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=2751.8799999999997s)]
*  You're thinking you're imagining my wife and thinking that she looks like a senior [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=2754.16s)]
*  citizen. [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=2757.6s)]
*  No, I know. [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=2758.3199999999997s)]
*  Is that where your mind went? [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=2758.56s)]
*  You seem healthy and your wife looks hard in my imagination. [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=2760.04s)]
*  I do want to let you know that. [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=2762.72s)]
*  Okay. [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=2764.2799999999997s)]
*  No, but not, is she naked? [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=2764.96s)]
*  Nothing crazy. [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=2766.4399999999996s)]
*  No, no, she's very well. [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=2766.7999999999997s)]
*  She's working at a library. [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=2768.04s)]
*  Okay. [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=2769.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=2770.16s)]
*  I did an AI, like I did, I wanted to do an anniversary present. [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=2771.08s)]
*  It's, uh, in a couple of weeks. [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=2774.7599999999998s)]
*  I can't remember how many years it is because it's been so magical. [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=2776.72s)]
*  Um, it didn't make any sense. [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=2781.0s)]
*  But my point is I thought I'm going to do it. [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=2785.9199999999996s)]
*  It'll be funny if I do an AI picture of me and Nancy, uh, having a wonderful time [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=2787.9199999999996s)]
*  together, celebrating our anniversary. [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=2795.08s)]
*  You can put that into AI now, right? [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=2797.08s)]
*  And it'll make an amazing picture. [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=2799.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=2800.2799999999997s)]
*  But sometimes it's so over the top, it looks kind of funny. [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=2800.52s)]
*  So Louis and Nancy having a romantic meal to celebrate their anniversary. [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=2803.48s)]
*  And it was Louis Theroux. [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=2807.36s)]
*  So there was a guy who popped up in the picture and his beautiful wife, Nancy, [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=2808.56s)]
*  the guy looked like me, but she looked like a, like a 70 year old librarian. [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=2812.88s)]
*  And I kept having to fiddle the search terms to make her hot, like his much [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=2818.08s)]
*  younger, very attractive wife, Nancy. [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=2821.72s)]
*  But I couldn't meet, I couldn't seem to get the AI to make her attractive. [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=2825.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=2829.0s)]
*  So I ended up just putting in, live Tyler look alike. [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=2829.4s)]
*  Ooh, let's get strong. [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=2833.04s)]
*  And that did it. [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=2834.2s)]
*  I bumped a cigarette off her one night. [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=2835.12s)]
*  Did you? [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=2836.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=2837.0s)]
*  She seems like a nice person. [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=2837.6s)]
*  She was very nice. [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=2839.16s)]
*  She gave me, I think she was, yeah, she gave me half of a menthol cigarette. [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=2840.56s)]
*  I was like, yeah, I kept it. [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=2845.36s)]
*  I didn't even smell it. [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=2846.36s)]
*  I took a couple of hits off of it and I put it out. [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=2846.88s)]
*  Yeah, I really thought that was nice of her. [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=2849.24s)]
*  Um, it's funny how you could tell a lot. [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=2851.12s)]
*  I'd maybe not, but you know, little encounters with people, ships passing [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=2854.88s)]
*  in the night and that was enough. [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=2858.52s)]
*  You get a sense. [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=2860.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=2861.52s)]
*  You get a little bit of a sense. [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=2862.0s)]
*  It's funny that she smokes menthol though. [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=2862.72s)]
*  It shocked me. [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=2864.3599999999997s)]
*  But first time I smoked a menthol, it's like, just tastes like it's good for me. [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=2865.7999999999997s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=2870.3999999999996s)]
*  That's that kind of mint sort of refreshing tastes like you just had washed [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=2871.04s)]
*  under your arms. [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=2874.48s)]
*  You're like, God, that's strong. [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=2875.52s)]
*  Well, I can see a lot of black guys would smoke them when I was growing up. [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=2877.3599999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=2880.24s)]
*  But according to legend, according to legend, I'll tell you straight up, [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=2880.3999999999996s)]
*  Terry was smoking the Mitch's dude when I met him. [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=2884.08s)]
*  A lot of the brothers would smoke them. [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=2886.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=2888.04s)]
*  Cause they wanted a stronger cigarette. [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=2888.4399999999996s)]
*  I think black people are just a, they can, they're strong. [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=2890.2s)]
*  There's just a tougher ilk. [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=2893.44s)]
*  But they haven't they banned? [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=2895.72s)]
*  I'm not touching that by the way. [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=2897.48s)]
*  Menthol. [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=2899.0s)]
*  Haven't they banned menthol or not? [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=2899.64s)]
*  I don't know if they banned it or not, but people are still doing it, unfortunately. [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=2902.3199999999997s)]
*  And a lot of, a lot of redheads will smoke them too. [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=2908.36s)]
*  So when you see that sort of the, you know, if you look along the, I mean, yeah, [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=2912.04s)]
*  redheads are kind of exotic. [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=2918.92s)]
*  I would say, you know, if you look in the Bible, there's none of them. [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=2920.32s)]
*  But kind of, yeah. [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=2922.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=2924.0s)]
*  There's no redheads in the Bible. [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=2924.28s)]
*  For real. [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=2925.56s)]
*  So have you really checked that? [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=2927.76s)]
*  A hundred percent. [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=2929.92s)]
*  We run that up. [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=2930.84s)]
*  How many gingers are in the Bible? [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=2931.56s)]
*  And also, uh, so obviously they're manmade. [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=2934.04s)]
*  I think that's safe to say. [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=2937.64s)]
*  Right. [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=2938.96s)]
*  Um, engineered. [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=2940.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=2941.84s)]
*  That's interesting. [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=2942.16s)]
*  Um, I feel like I've, you know, I was just going to say like, [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=2943.96s)]
*  I feel like, um, like this is a good conversation, but I also feel like I've, [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=2948.28s)]
*  I've talked a lot about, I've kind of stereotypical gender stuff. [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=2953.0800000000004s)]
*  And I feel like people might think, oh, he's made all those programs and he's [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=2956.52s)]
*  been to incredible places and like, that's what he's learned is. [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=2959.44s)]
*  I think where they think we're just joking around and having fun. [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=2963.0400000000004s)]
*  I think that's what they think. [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=2965.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=2967.2400000000002s)]
*  A hundred percent. [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=2967.48s)]
*  That's what I think. [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=2968.1200000000003s)]
*  And, but I think there's also snippets of reality. [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=2969.52s)]
*  I think when you talk with people, like guys who are creatives, like yourself, [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=2972.0400000000004s)]
*  there's, I think even you probably surprise yourself sometimes with what's reality [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=2976.7599999999998s)]
*  maybe at times and what's your imagination and the little bit of both. [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=2981.44s)]
*  Maybe I don't know. [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=2985.9199999999996s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=2986.7599999999998s)]
*  So my thing is I'd like to, um, I'd like to feel like I'm wise and I'd like to [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=2987.2s)]
*  feel like I've gone through life. [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=2993.6s)]
*  Um, and I figured something out and you know, I've been to extraordinary places [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=2995.68s)]
*  and delve deep into human psychology and I've arrived, you know, like with some [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3000.48s)]
*  elder, so some elder wisdom, but I haven't. [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3005.6s)]
*  But I think people have respect that you're on the journey. [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3010.88s)]
*  No doubt. [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3013.64s)]
*  Yes. [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3014.04s)]
*  I'm still on the journey. [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3014.3199999999997s)]
*  I think a lot of people see that if they pitch you, they pitch you on the side of [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3015.48s)]
*  the Himalayas with a backpack on. [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3018.6s)]
*  And thank you. [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3020.0s)]
*  And I think part of my gift, if I may put it like that, you've really seen some of [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3020.92s)]
*  my programs, that's a thrill. [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3024.72s)]
*  Where would you have seen them? [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3025.8399999999997s)]
*  I don't want to watch the new documentary, which I do want to talk about. [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3026.7999999999997s)]
*  Shout that out. [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3029.2799999999997s)]
*  I want to talk about that. [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3030.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3031.04s)]
*  I'm not in that one. [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3031.44s)]
*  That one's I'm executive producer of that one. [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3032.24s)]
*  If it's the one I'm thinking of, tell them you love me on Netflix. [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3034.12s)]
*  Oh, it was great. [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3037.48s)]
*  It's, I mean, it's dark. [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3038.44s)]
*  It was fat. [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3040.04s)]
*  I did not see some of the turn that it took. [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3041.16s)]
*  It's extraordinary. [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3043.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3044.48s)]
*  Can I set it up very briefly? [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3044.88s)]
*  That's all I was going to ask you. [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3046.2799999999997s)]
*  No, cause I want people to go watch it cause it really was good. [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3047.56s)]
*  Yep. [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3050.6s)]
*  It really was good. [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3051.2s)]
*  It's like a true crime kind of psychology, psychological thriller drama. [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3052.3199999999997s)]
*  You will love it. [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3058.08s)]
*  If you like true crime type of stuff, I think you will absolutely love this. [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3058.72s)]
*  In a twisty turn, I can't believe what I'm watching kind of a way. [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3063.48s)]
*  It's about a philosophy professor and a very disabled young black guy who's [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3069.16s)]
*  nonverbal and has always been assumed to have a cognitive, significant [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3076.12s)]
*  cognitive impairment, and she, she's a philosophy professor and she starts [[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3081.52s)]
*  working with him and appears to unlock all kinds of special abilities and his [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3085.88s)]
*  family, the young guy, Derek, his family is obviously thrilled. [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3091.24s)]
*  He starts going to college. [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3095.3199999999997s)]
*  He's having philosophical conversations with her. [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3097.08s)]
*  I don't know if he's writing poetry, but he's sort of writing essays and they, [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3100.08s)]
*  they, they have this meeting of minds and according to her version, they fall in [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3105.72s)]
*  love and they strike up a physical relationship. [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3110.8799999999997s)]
*  But then questions start being raised about the nature of the technique that [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3115.08s)]
*  she's using to open up, uh, his abilities, his alleged abilities, and then the [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3118.88s)]
*  abilities come under question and his family, Derek's family start feeling [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3125.2000000000003s)]
*  actually, he doesn't have the special abilities and this isn't a thrilling story [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3130.56s)]
*  about love across the divide. [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3136.08s)]
*  It's actually abuse and she gets prosecuted and sent to prison. [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3138.28s)]
*  So you're all the way along. [[00:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3142.28s)]
*  You're trying to figure out what really happened. [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3143.2400000000002s)]
*  It's on. [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3145.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3145.6800000000003s)]
*  It blew my mind because there's so many little things. [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3146.04s)]
*  Well, and one of the things that you have to know, I are, that helps to know [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3148.88s)]
*  if you're a listener is that one of the ways she, that the teacher and a stubble [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3151.68s)]
*  field is her name that she would, um, help Derek. [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3156.2s)]
*  Cause he basically, at first you see him or you think of him and you think there's [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3159.6s)]
*  not a real him in there. [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3164.0s)]
*  Well, there's a, there's a, well, I don't want to say that. [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3165.84s)]
*  No, no offense, but my people, my listen, no, I don't know. [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3167.96s)]
*  I'm trying my best, but when you look at him, there's a him in there. [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3172.56s)]
*  But you don't know how much of him there is. [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3176.0s)]
*  And it's hard for us to see a lot of times the person that is inside sometimes [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3178.08s)]
*  of a person that has a severe physical disability. [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3183.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3186.24s)]
*  I, I he's there, but he's, and he just got a profound disability and you don't [[00:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3187.28s)]
*  know the nature of what is capable of. [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3192.88s)]
*  Right. [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3194.48s)]
*  And. [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3195.04s)]
*  And she starts, she starts teaching he, she starts becoming she, the facilitated, [[00:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3197.56s)]
*  the way that they, that they start to communicate it's called facilitated [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3204.0s)]
*  communication. [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3208.32s)]
*  And in essence, what happens is she's called Anna, Anna. [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3208.96s)]
*  I can't get you to say Anna, but that's how she says it. [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3212.08s)]
*  So, and, and the Derek's mom's called, um, Daisy and it becomes almost a [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3214.32s)]
*  custody battle between them. [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3220.2400000000002s)]
*  And the first inkling that something's wrong is that, uh, Anna starts saying, [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3221.76s)]
*  like Daisy will put some meat and potatoes down and, and Anna will go like, [[00:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3227.52s)]
*  well, Derek really doesn't like meat. [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3233.36s)]
*  He's a vegetarian. [[00:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3235.6800000000003s)]
*  And his mom's like, what? [[00:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3237.76s)]
*  And, and he doesn't listen and she'll put gospel music on there from a [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3238.7200000000003s)]
*  churchy family. [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3241.52s)]
*  And, and, and, and Anna goes like Derek doesn't really doesn't like gospel. [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3242.88s)]
*  He prefers classical and, um, he likes, he drinks red wine and, you know, and he [[00:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3247.84s)]
*  prefers Cabernet and like all these sort of markers of, of, of, of what might be [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3253.6800000000003s)]
*  construed as sort of elite or slightly refined. [[00:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3259.04s)]
*  I didn't even think about that. [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3263.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3264.48s)]
*  So there's a sort of class thing, like, and so Daisy's like, well, gospel's not [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3264.56s)]
*  good enough for him anymore. [[00:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3268.32s)]
*  Like she's, she feels offended. [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3269.6s)]
*  Like the son that she's always known is being, is being kind of taken away from [[00:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3271.2s)]
*  her. [[00:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3276.96s)]
*  Right. [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3277.2s)]
*  And it's almost like a power play. [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3277.7599999999998s)]
*  Like I know him better than I'm not saying that as how Anna meets, but that's [[00:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3279.44s)]
*  a season. [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3282.56s)]
*  How it come across to a mother and especially, I think also a black mother. [[00:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3283.12s)]
*  Who's like, who's a, yo, he's not going to eat my cooking. [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3286.96s)]
*  Right. [[00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3289.2000000000003s)]
*  Because he's a vegetarian. [[00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3289.6s)]
*  Like he only eats nut cutlets now. [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3290.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3293.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3293.6s)]
*  He only eats like short breads or whatever. [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3293.84s)]
*  He eats corn and, and, and you lie. [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3296.32s)]
*  I'm not trying to mischaracterize it at all. [[00:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3299.92s)]
*  We're joking around. [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3302.0s)]
*  He only has a Boo-ya base or whatever. [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3302.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3305.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3305.76s)]
*  He'll only be a vegetarian. [[00:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3306.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3307.6800000000003s)]
*  And that's insane. [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3307.84s)]
*  First of all, to say that a black guy's a vegetarian is absolute. [[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3308.88s)]
*  Nobody's going to believe that dude. [[00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3314.2400000000002s)]
*  Named 70 black vegetarians. [[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3316.48s)]
*  Okay. [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3319.28s)]
*  Maybe Arthur Ash was one, but that's it. [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3319.6s)]
*  Nobody's buying that shit. [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3323.28s)]
*  So out of the gate, the mom was like, Hmm. [[00:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3324.64s)]
*  You know, so, but I, I think that's where it starts. [[00:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3327.2000000000003s)]
*  There's a glitch and then it spins out. [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3329.92s)]
*  And then when she says, and then they have the moment where they announced to Daisy [[00:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3332.32s)]
*  and, and to Derek's brother, John, that they're having a relationship and they sit down [[00:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3337.12s)]
*  and, and it's Ana and Derek sit down with John and Daisy and say like, I don't know. [[00:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3344.88s)]
*  I think they might've been excited to break the news. [[00:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3349.6000000000004s)]
*  Of course. [[00:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3352.88s)]
*  But it's a sensitive thing saying like, not only are we, [[00:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3353.92s)]
*  cause they weren't saying, do we have, I'd like permission to ask for your son's hand in marriage. [[00:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3356.88s)]
*  It wasn't like that was like, by the way, we're doing it. [[00:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3361.84s)]
*  Like we're already. [[00:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3365.44s)]
*  They said we've been shagging a bit. [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3366.56s)]
*  Yes. [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3368.32s)]
*  Basically, and we're in love. [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3368.7200000000003s)]
*  Basically. [[00:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3370.0s)]
*  I don't think they used the term shagging, but it was along those lines. [[00:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3370.32s)]
*  And, and, and I think it felt to Daisy and John, like they still had a protective, [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3374.9599999999996s)]
*  because the kids, he's not a kid. [[00:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3382.3999999999996s)]
*  He's a young man. [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3384.3199999999997s)]
*  The young man is vulnerable. [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3385.04s)]
*  Right. [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3387.7599999999998s)]
*  So they don't know. [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3388.08s)]
*  Like, and also they don't want to think about him sexual, probably having adventurous [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3388.8799999999997s)]
*  sexual relations, like with, with, with the woman who's basically got a, a caretaking role. [[00:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3394.56s)]
*  Right. [[00:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3402.7999999999997s)]
*  And it's a professional relationship. [[00:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3402.9599999999996s)]
*  It's a complicated power dynamic. [[00:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3405.04s)]
*  So the brother, John, he's so shocked. [[00:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3407.2799999999997s)]
*  He goes and throws up. [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3410.08s)]
*  He's like, he cuts him to the, like to the soul, like he feels so confused and befuddled [[00:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3412.08s)]
*  by, by the relationship. [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3419.2s)]
*  I mean, a lot of it is just also the awkwardness of, you know, the bigger conversation is race. [[00:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3421.12s)]
*  Well, I was going to say disability. [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3426.3999999999996s)]
*  Oh, okay. [[00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3429.04s)]
*  Is that people who are very disabled, I say very, but people who have, who can't walk [[00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3429.92s)]
*  and maybe can't actually feed themselves or who have, who need round the clock assistance [[00:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3435.6s)]
*  with day-to-day life and may have like real, really like real cognitive delays, like where [[00:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3442.0s)]
*  they seem to be incapable, you know, they'll watch cartoons and enjoy life, but they're not going to [[00:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3449.2000000000003s)]
*  be reading books and stuff. [[00:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3455.6800000000003s)]
*  A lot of people don't want to think about the sexual relations. [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3457.52s)]
*  It's almost like they're infantilized and it's seen as inappropriate that they have sexual desires. [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3461.52s)]
*  Right. [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3466.64s)]
*  But they do. [[00:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3467.52s)]
*  Of course they do because they're full grown people. [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3468.64s)]
*  Right? [[00:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3471.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3471.92s)]
*  They're going to be obvious. [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3472.16s)]
*  And especially, well, one of the things you have to let people know too, I think is the way that [[00:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3473.2s)]
*  Anna or Anna would communicate. [[00:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3478.96s)]
*  She, there's like this sort of typewriter. [[00:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3482.88s)]
*  Type of contraption. [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3487.92s)]
*  It's almost like, like a first typewriter you would give a child to learn to do typing on. [[00:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3489.12s)]
*  Like a speaking spell. [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3493.52s)]
*  Yeah, like a speaking spell. [[00:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3494.56s)]
*  And she would kind of guide his hand or hold his hand because his hand would often [[00:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3495.68s)]
*  kind of vibrate a lot. [[00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3500.48s)]
*  So she would hold his hand as he would write out the different things he wanted to say. [[00:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3501.84s)]
*  So right there, it's just such a like, who is the right, who is, is it mostly him? [[00:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3507.7599999999998s)]
*  Is she guiding based on things she wants? [[00:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3513.7599999999998s)]
*  Is she even unknowingly guiding based on things that she may want because there's desires inside [[00:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3516.4s)]
*  of us? [[00:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3522.0s)]
*  So the allegation, the contention by the skeptics would be that, because she had long [[00:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3522.48s)]
*  conversations with him using that technique. [[00:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3527.76s)]
*  Right. [[00:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3530.4s)]
*  A little like a Ouija board would be the other analogy. [[00:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3530.56s)]
*  Good call. [[00:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3532.8s)]
*  If you wanted to say that it was dubious and non-scientific, but the allegation would be that [[00:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3533.36s)]
*  she was in essence having long conversations with herself and producing her ideal love partner, [[00:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3540.48s)]
*  like someone who likes all the same thing. [[00:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3548.72s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3550.4s)]
*  Like a fan fiction, almost writing her own fan fiction or something. [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3550.88s)]
*  Creating, and I'll leave it to people because it's sort of, viewers could go on the journey [[00:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3553.92s)]
*  and figure out what they think happened. [[00:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3561.04s)]
*  But one version of events is that she was projecting a kind of idealized version [[00:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3563.36s)]
*  and using Derek almost as a prop. [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3570.56s)]
*  Like a Geppetto and a Pinocchio type. [[00:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3574.56s)]
*  She was puppeteering. [[00:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3577.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3578.32s)]
*  A real life human used as a prop. [[00:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3579.36s)]
*  But then it's so strange. [[00:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3582.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3583.68s)]
*  And certainly possible for sure. [[00:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3584.16s)]
*  It feels so strange to want to go spend all that time with someone. [[00:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3586.0s)]
*  Oh, I should share. [[00:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3591.28s)]
*  I need to mention the director, Nick August Perna, who did a brilliant job. [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3592.0s)]
*  It's great. [[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3596.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3596.96s)]
*  He's terrific. [[00:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3597.04s)]
*  As much as I'm here talking about it, I was an executive producer on it, but it's his project. [[00:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3598.88s)]
*  Bring him up. [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3607.28s)]
*  Nick August Perna. [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3607.68s)]
*  Nick August Perna. [[01:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3609.04s)]
*  August. [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3610.56s)]
*  Let's get a picture of the man. [[01:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3611.52s)]
*  There we go. [[01:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3613.84s)]
*  There he is. [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3614.8s)]
*  Perna. [[01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3615.36s)]
*  Do Google. [[01:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3616.08s)]
*  There he is. [[01:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3616.64s)]
*  What a handsome man. [[01:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3617.12s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3618.0s)]
*  Look at his eyes. [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3618.08s)]
*  Wow. [[01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3620.64s)]
*  Why would he look like that? [[01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3620.96s)]
*  Is he Bangladeshi, you think? [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3622.08s)]
*  I think he, I don't know. [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3623.76s)]
*  Here's, you know, I never asked. [[01:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3628.0s)]
*  I don't think August Perna sounds like a Bangladeshi name, but I love that he's got beautiful, [[01:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3629.76s)]
*  swarthy skin and piercing blue eyes and a thick beard. [[01:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3637.5200000000004s)]
*  I used to have a beard like that and then I got alopecia. [[01:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3640.32s)]
*  Did you really? [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3642.5600000000004s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3643.5200000000004s)]
*  My beard fell out. [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3643.6800000000003s)]
*  Oh, my God. [[01:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3644.96s)]
*  I know. [[01:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3645.84s)]
*  And my hair has gone thin. [[01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3646.4s)]
*  I have patches in my hair. [[01:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3647.76s)]
*  That's an exclusive. [[01:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3649.28s)]
*  I've never spoken about that on a podcast. [[01:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3650.2400000000002s)]
*  About having alopecia? [[01:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3652.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3654.3199999999997s)]
*  And is it a real thing you have to deal with all the time? [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3654.7999999999997s)]
*  Well, it's always there. [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3658.24s)]
*  It's there when I look in the mirror and if I touch my hair, I used to feel [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3660.08s)]
*  kind of thick, lustrous locks, like gorgeous, just enjoyable. [[01:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3665.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3670.4799999999996s)]
*  Like a bit like your hair. [[01:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3671.2799999999997s)]
*  It's thin though. [[01:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3672.64s)]
*  It starts to get thin. [[01:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3673.2s)]
*  And then little holes appear. [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3674.16s)]
*  Can you see that? [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3676.9599999999996s)]
*  And my beard, it's coming back, but it's white. [[01:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3677.8399999999997s)]
*  I feel like one of those guys who's seen a ghost and their hair goes white and falls out. [[01:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3680.24s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3686.8799999999997s)]
*  That sounds very like a Scooby-Doo. [[01:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3687.4399999999996s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3691.12s)]
*  Does it stress you out or do you care that much? [[01:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3691.3599999999997s)]
*  You already have a family. [[01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3692.9599999999996s)]
*  You have a wife already. [[01:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3693.8399999999997s)]
*  I care a bit because I think my wife cares. [[01:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3694.56s)]
*  And the last thing I need is to be even less attractive to her. [[01:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3696.8799999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3700.3199999999997s)]
*  Have another crisp, Lindsay or whatever. [[01:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3700.56s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3702.16s)]
*  Nancy, like he's coercive. [[01:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3703.7599999999998s)]
*  She doesn't sound like that. [[01:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3706.64s)]
*  He's coercive and he's almost bald. [[01:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3707.68s)]
*  He's got patches in his hair. [[01:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3710.16s)]
*  You need to leave him. [[01:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3711.9199999999996s)]
*  He's no good for you. [[01:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3714.16s)]
*  Right? [[01:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3716.16s)]
*  And that's your daughter saying that. [[01:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3717.6s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3719.12s)]
*  He's no good for you. [[01:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3720.0s)]
*  Your wife's friends, you've got that to look forward to is like the toxic friend. [[01:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3722.24s)]
*  You're too good for him. [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3728.08s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[01:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3729.9199999999996s)]
*  Every girlfriend I've ever had is had that friend for sure. [[01:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3730.96s)]
*  And they were right. [[01:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3733.04s)]
*  They were right. [[01:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3734.08s)]
*  She is too good for me. [[01:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3735.3599999999997s)]
*  They're all too good for us. [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3736.3999999999996s)]
*  When it really comes down to it often. [[01:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3738.0s)]
*  She's so much better looking than I am. [[01:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3739.28s)]
*  I was on TV when I met her. [[01:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3742.96s)]
*  So it was adjusted. [[01:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3744.56s)]
*  It was adjusted for celebrity. [[01:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3746.7200000000003s)]
*  It happens. [[01:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3748.7200000000003s)]
*  You know what? [[01:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3750.0s)]
*  One thing that I thought was interesting about Tell Them You Love Me, is that right? [[01:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3750.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3754.96s)]
*  So she kind of has the ability to guide his hand possibly, right? [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3756.7200000000003s)]
*  Or probably does some ability to guide it. [[01:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3761.36s)]
*  She has the ability and whether she's doing it is the question. [[01:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3763.6s)]
*  Right. [[01:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3766.32s)]
*  And only she kind of knows. [[01:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3766.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3768.96s)]
*  Like there's some studies in there that a doctor or a scientist does that helps you get a little bit [[01:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3769.52s)]
*  of inclination. [[01:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3774.48s)]
*  But even then you're not fully sure because some people say like we're the keys to each other's [[01:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3775.2000000000003s)]
*  locks, right? [[01:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3781.76s)]
*  Like when we maybe when we join hands, something more magical can happen. [[01:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3782.32s)]
*  You know? [[01:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3787.52s)]
*  But then also I start to think about like the ownership now of like social media and these [[01:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3788.96s)]
*  bigger corporations that own a lot of the platforms that we communicate on because they [[01:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3797.84s)]
*  can dictate if we're even allowed to say certain things. [[01:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3802.7200000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3806.6400000000003s)]
*  You know, it's like you might write what you really want to say. [[01:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3807.44s)]
*  But at some point they can say, well, we understand what you'd like to say, but you're only allowed [[01:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3810.88s)]
*  to say these things. [[01:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3817.36s)]
*  Are you okay if we format it for that? [[01:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3818.48s)]
*  And you have to say yes. [[01:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3820.8s)]
*  And if you hit no, it just asks you the question again. [[01:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3821.76s)]
*  Seriously? [[01:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3825.1200000000003s)]
*  I mean, does that happen? [[01:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3826.08s)]
*  Is that real? [[01:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3827.52s)]
*  It just feels like that's very much where we're headed. [[01:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3828.48s)]
*  Like they give you a certain amount of emojis. [[01:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3831.44s)]
*  You don't get all of them. [[01:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3834.0s)]
*  If you want to feel belittled, you must you have to pay $2,000 a month for that emoji. [[01:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3837.6s)]
*  I just wonder if that's what you know what I'm saying? [[01:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3842.8s)]
*  Like what color are you in your emojis? [[01:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3844.4s)]
*  Like when you, you know, the smiley face, did you opt for the white one? [[01:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3847.36s)]
*  Cause I'm sticking with yellow and increasingly I wonder if [[01:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3850.6400000000003s)]
*  It's very Asian. [[01:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3853.84s)]
*  It's a bold choice. [[01:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3854.8s)]
*  A lot of Asians would be upset about it too. [[01:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3856.0s)]
*  Would they though? [[01:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3858.0s)]
*  Because it's a bright, puce yellow. [[01:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3858.88s)]
*  It's no yellow that's found in the human condition. [[01:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3861.36s)]
*  I would agree with you. [[01:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3864.8s)]
*  What emoji? [[01:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3866.48s)]
*  Cause you know, there's a certain point where the first time you use a reaction, [[01:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3867.6800000000003s)]
*  it gives you a choice. [[01:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3872.4s)]
*  So now you have a dilemma. [[01:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3873.92s)]
*  Do I go white? [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3875.76s)]
*  Do I go off white? [[01:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3877.2s)]
*  Do I go beige? [[01:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3878.72s)]
*  I think it depends on what neighborhood I'm driving through at the time sometimes. [[01:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3879.9199999999996s)]
*  Really? [[01:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3883.2s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[01:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3883.7599999999998s)]
*  Cause I'll be like, you know, this is what's going on around here. [[01:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3884.24s)]
*  And you're half Nicaraguan. [[01:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3889.04s)]
*  So you must, did you go white or off white? [[01:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3890.8799999999997s)]
*  I'll go off white. [[01:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3893.12s)]
*  I'll go middle Eastern sometimes. [[01:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3894.48s)]
*  So you keep choosing different ones? [[01:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3896.56s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[01:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3898.08s)]
*  I'll throw a sand brother out there, dude. [[01:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3898.3999999999996s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3900.16s)]
*  I'll do it all man. [[01:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3900.3199999999997s)]
*  Cause you gotta keep people on the edge. [[01:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3901.68s)]
*  I mean, I even choose the pregnant guy nowadays. [[01:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3903.6s)]
*  It's like, what are we even fucking doing? [[01:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3907.9199999999996s)]
*  Is there a pregnant guy? [[01:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3910.8799999999997s)]
*  There's a fucking pregnant guy. [[01:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3912.3199999999997s)]
*  What are we doing? [[01:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3914.3199999999997s)]
*  They're trying to legalize all that, you know? [[01:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3916.24s)]
*  But do you worry about that, about like censorship and what will be allowed? [[01:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3918.96s)]
*  I've said this before, but it's like, it used to be like you wrote on the paper, right? [[01:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3924.16s)]
*  And now you can still write on the paper. [[01:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3929.3599999999997s)]
*  But what if the- [[01:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3931.6s)]
*  On a piece of paper. [[01:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3932.0s)]
*  Yes, you can. [[01:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3932.96s)]
*  But what if the paper, what if they own, what if- [[01:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3933.4399999999996s)]
*  I think I got shadow banned. [[01:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3935.76s)]
*  I don't know what for. [[01:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3937.44s)]
*  Well, here you go. [[01:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3938.88s)]
*  I don't know what for. [[01:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3940.0s)]
*  Either that or it's so boring that they were like, we gotta stop putting, we gotta, [[01:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3941.1200000000003s)]
*  he's making the platform look bad. [[01:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3946.7200000000003s)]
*  His tweets are so banal. [[01:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3948.7200000000003s)]
*  Just dial them right down. [[01:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3950.96s)]
*  He's making everyone, you know, when I did Joe Rogan's podcast, I did it twice. [[01:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3953.0400000000004s)]
*  And when he moved to Spotify, do you remember that big deal? [[01:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3957.2000000000003s)]
*  And they gave him like 10,000 million, whatever dollars. [[01:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3959.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3963.92s)]
*  And some of them they took off, like they took some episodes. [[01:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3964.3999999999996s)]
*  They took one of yours off? [[01:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3968.3999999999996s)]
*  So they took the most contentious, like these are too, we can't put this on Spotify. [[01:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3969.2s)]
*  This is too inflammatory. [[01:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3974.64s)]
*  And one of mine was taken off. [[01:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3976.48s)]
*  But I think it was taken off because I was so boring. [[01:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3978.96s)]
*  I just can't because I said it's nothing. [[01:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3982.0s)]
*  But I loved that I might be too spicy. [[01:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3985.2s)]
*  And I was like, they've taken me down. [[01:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3988.0s)]
*  You know, like I've been made, they canceled me. [[01:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3990.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3994.72s)]
*  But it was, I think it was the first time I did Rogan, I didn't know how big he was. [[01:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3995.2799999999997s)]
*  And you know how he kind of plays a reactive game? [[01:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=3999.68s)]
*  Like in other words, he doesn't go on and say like, I've watched all your programs. [[01:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=4002.56s)]
*  I'm not gonna do, I was gonna do an English accent. [[01:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=4006.48s)]
*  I don't know why. [[01:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=4007.9199999999996s)]
*  Here's Joe Rogan. [[01:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=4008.3199999999997s)]
*  I've watched all your programs and I've done a lot of research and he's more like, [[01:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=4009.2s)]
*  hey, welcome. [[01:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=4014.64s)]
*  How's it going? [[01:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=4015.4399999999996s)]
*  And I was like, I'm very reactive as well. [[01:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=4016.48s)]
*  So it was kind of like, how are you doing? [[01:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=4019.12s)]
*  I'm like, good. [[01:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=4020.88s)]
*  How are you doing? [[01:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=4021.36s)]
*  Good. [[01:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=4022.56s)]
*  And then it was like two hours went by and it kind of got into a groove a bit. [[01:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=4025.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=4029.52s)]
*  I mean, it's probably fine. [[01:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=4030.48s)]
*  I haven't got- [[01:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=4031.76s)]
*  I listened to the one I listened to. [[01:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=4032.2400000000002s)]
*  I thought was fine. [[01:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=4033.84s)]
*  That was good. [[01:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=4034.4s)]
*  The second one I went back and I was like, oh, I get it. [[01:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=4034.8s)]
*  Maybe that was it. [[01:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=4037.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=4038.48s)]
*  The second one was fine. [[01:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=4038.8s)]
*  So I'm quite glad that they, but your point was about, [[01:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=4039.84s)]
*  so yeah, I think they shadow banned me on Twitter. [[01:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=4043.04s)]
*  I can't prove it. [[01:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=4046.08s)]
*  Instagram, I'm okay. [[01:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=4047.12s)]
*  I can put a picture of my- [[01:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=4048.4s)]
*  I could just do a selfie and put it on Instagram and it goes viral. [[01:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=4050.3199999999997s)]
*  I don't know why, but if I say I've got alopecia and I'm feeling sad, like cynical, [[01:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=4057.2799999999997s)]
*  what do they call that? [[01:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=4063.12s)]
*  I'll put three black dude emojis in there if you say that. [[01:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=4064.08s)]
*  They're just to spice things up. [[01:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=4066.7999999999997s)]
*  You think that would make a difference? [[01:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=4068.08s)]
*  Oh yeah, dude. [[01:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=4069.52s)]
*  You bring a brother in, it adds some heat to the situation. [[01:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=4070.56s)]
*  I've listened to your content and you go close to the line. [[01:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=4073.36s)]

*  Some of it. [[01:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=4082.8s)]

*  You know, like I think a lot of times I'm kind of like just having a good time. [[01:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=4086.2400000000002s)]
*  You get a free pass, I think, because you're a comedian and people are like, [[01:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=4090.96s)]
*  he's just having, he's goofing around. [[01:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=4093.84s)]

*  Does that mean something? [[01:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=4118.400000000001s)]
*  I don't know if it means anything beyond the fact that you're right there assisting him in that moment. [[01:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=4119.68s)]
*  Would he be like, hey, Theo, would you spot me? What could he bench? [[01:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=4123.52s)]
*  He was strong. [[01:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=4129.360000000001s)]

*  Did you try and be, were you trying to be a positive influence on him or would that [[01:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=4134.56s)]
*  would that have been inappropriate? [[01:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=4138.0s)]
*  No, I was using steroids. I think at the time I was just trying to freaking be jacked out there, dude. [[01:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=4139.68s)]
*  I was trying to flirt with his chick, dude. His girl was so, she was just a gorgeous. [[01:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=4144.400000000001s)]
*  She didn't do anything at the restaurant. Like she worked there, but I don't even know if she [[01:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=4150.320000000001s)]
*  knew what her job was. She was just so pretty. People would just do everything for her, you know? [[01:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=4153.76s)]
*  Like one of those maidens or whatever, you know? [[01:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=4158.0s)]
*  You would have been what? 1920? [[01:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=4161.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=4162.879999999999s)]
*  And you knew he was like politically. [[01:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=4164.08s)]
*  Well, I'd seen, they used to have signs in Louisiana. It was David Duke versus [[01:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=4166.879999999999s)]
*  Edwin Edwards and he was a famed political figure in Louisiana who had stolen tons of money, [[01:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=4171.759999999999s)]
*  like most of them. And his, the campaign slogan was don't vote for the racist, [[01:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=4179.5199999999995s)]
*  vote for the crook. Those were the posters. So you knew- [[01:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=4185.76s)]
*  I'm surprised he authorized that. [[01:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=4190.24s)]
*  But I think people would rather be stolen from, at the time people would rather be stolen from [[01:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=4192.8s)]
*  than have a little bit of racism be going on. [[01:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=4196.64s)]
*  But Duke got a majority of the white vote. [[01:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=4199.4400000000005s)]
*  He might've done okay. [[01:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=4202.0s)]
*  I don't remember. That's a good question. What was the runoff vote between David Duke or [[01:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=4203.68s)]
*  the David Duke and Edwin Edwards? [[01:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=4207.6s)]
*  Duke, he got the whatever, was it the Republican nomination? Like he ran for Senate. [[01:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=4209.68s)]

*  When I knew him, he was just doing chest and tris, you know? Like that's what he was doing. [[01:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=4219.92s)]

*  No. [[01:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=4244.72s)]

*  He was the Republican, Bennett Johnson. What is that? He was the incumbent. He got 40, [[01:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=4251.52s)]

*  Yeah. I mean, there's a lot of old, there's a lot of racism in the South, you know? And there's a [[01:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=4271.44s)]
*  lot of racism that goes both ways in the South too. There's a lot of black folks that do not like [[01:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=4275.44s)]
*  white people. [[01:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=4279.28s)]
*  For real. [[01:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=4280.32s)]
*  Tons, dude. Tons. [[01:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=4282.32s)]
*  Anyway- [[01:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=4285.5199999999995s)]
*  It always gets looked at as the other way only, but there's a lot of- [[01:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=4285.839999999999s)]
*  But they're making, they're making up for lost time. [[01:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=4290.16s)]
*  I agree that there's some of that in there for sure. [[01:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=4293.28s)]
*  They're like- [[01:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=4296.4s)]
*  I agree. [[01:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=4297.36s)]
*  We gotta get Simone back. [[01:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=4299.04s)]
*  But I think- [[01:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=4301.12s)]
*  The documentary's called- No. [[01:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=4301.36s)]
*  Sometimes, one of the tough things you have in now is there's so much crime in a lot of the [[01:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=4303.599999999999s)]
*  black communities and it's very unfortunate. [[01:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=4307.12s)]
*  I've made documentaries about gangster rap. [[01:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=4309.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=4311.679999999999s)]
*  I made a couple and one was in- [[01:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=4312.0s)]
*  Well, I wish they were just rapping. Unfortunately, a lot of these men are shooting each other for [[01:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=4313.92s)]
*  no reason. [[01:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=4317.2s)]
*  And killing. [[01:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=4317.84s)]
*  Rapping seems like the only- [[01:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=4318.48s)]
*  Heartbreaking, man. Two of my good friends have died. My black friends have died from- [[01:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=4319.44s)]
*  It's the only part of show business where- [[01:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=4322.8s)]
*  Like- [[01:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=4324.88s)]
*  Died from being killed, obviously, but sorry, died from just miscellaneous other men shooting [[01:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=4325.6s)]
*  them for no reason. [[01:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=4331.04s)]
*  It seems like it's the only branch of show business where actually killing someone is [[01:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=4332.64s)]
*  not necessarily a career ender. [[01:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=4336.72s)]
*  Rap music? [[01:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=4340.24s)]
*  Mm-hmm. [[01:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=4340.8s)]
*  That's a good call. [[01:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=4341.360000000001s)]
*  Right, because you look at Gucci Mane. He killed someone, they said, [[01:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=4342.72s)]
*  Yeah, well, it was self-defense. [[01:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=4347.5199999999995s)]
*  And no one really minded. [[01:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=4350.16s)]
*  Yeah, well, what's his name? Just killed someone at a Walmart not long ago. [[01:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=4353.04s)]
*  Who was that? [[01:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=4356.96s)]
*  Alec Baldwin? [[01:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=4357.44s)]
*  Again? [[01:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=4359.919999999999s)]
*  That would be like, okay. [[01:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=4362.24s)]
*  Oh, that's hilarious, dude. Thank you for that. [[01:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=4363.44s)]
*  Okay. [[01:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=4366.08s)]
*  That was awesome, dude. Alec Baldwin. Every week he's fucking shooting somebody. [[01:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=4366.48s)]
*  Well, he wasn't even shooting a movie. [[01:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=4375.2s)]
*  Just fucking- [[01:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=4377.52s)]
*  And I think that's his defense. He's like, I thought we were shooting a movie. [[01:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=4379.12s)]
*  You know? Like, come on, that's crazy. [[01:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=4382.0s)]
*  That's too much. [[01:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=4385.360000000001s)]
*  I love how he's on trial for this. They gave him a gun. [[01:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=4386.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=4389.68s)]
*  He fucking shoots it. [[01:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=4390.0s)]
*  And the person who gave it to him, it's just the whole thing is just bad news. [[01:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=4391.92s)]
*  But yeah, somebody just killed somebody at a Walmart and they're getting off. [[01:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=4396.320000000001s)]
*  Oh, DaBaby did. [[01:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=4398.88s)]
*  Yeah, DaBaby. [[01:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=4400.0s)]
*  Yeah, and I heard he was in the adult section. That's the crazy part. [[01:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=4401.04s)]
*  Okay, that's enough of that. [[01:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=4404.8s)]
*  There we go. [[01:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=4408.4800000000005s)]
*  I was going to say though- [[01:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=4409.68s)]
*  It's a great documentary that you made. [[01:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=4410.64s)]
*  Yeah, and the truth is, one of the things that his mom, Daisy, says at the end is like, [[01:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=4412.16s)]
*  but now he still hasn't recovered. He masturbates. And she basically blames [[01:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=4417.84s)]
*  Arna for the fact that- [[01:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=4427.04s)]
*  Getting him started. [[01:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=4428.64s)]
*  She's caught Derek jacking off. And you're thinking like, he's a 35-year-old man living at home. [[01:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=4429.52s)]
*  What kind of world is she living in that she thinks that's pathological? [[01:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=4437.84s)]
*  Do you know what I mean? [[01:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=4442.56s)]
*  Like, what else would he be doing at home? [[01:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=4444.080000000001s)]
*  Of course. [[01:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=4448.56s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=4449.200000000001s)]
*  By himself all day. [[01:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=4449.6s)]
*  By himself all day with no girlfriend. [[01:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=4450.320000000001s)]
*  I just put two extra Ottomans in the middle of the room and let him figure it out, you know, [[01:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=4453.92s)]
*  to be honest with you. [[01:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=4457.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=4458.16s)]
*  That's what a lot of kids need, you know, if he's at that stage in his well-being. [[01:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=4458.4s)]
*  Or send in, like, I don't know if this is like considered kosher or not, but aren't there nurses [[01:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=4462.0s)]
*  who can do that? And by the way, a nurse can be a man or a woman, but aren't there nurses that can [[01:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=4469.759999999999s)]
*  go in and isn't that part of therapy? Like that you- [[01:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=4474.5599999999995s)]
*  I would agree. [[01:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=4478.48s)]
*  That you would be allowed, like someone- [[01:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=4479.12s)]
*  Do a milking of them. [[01:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=4481.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=4482.639999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I don't see how that's not a service. [[01:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=4484.5599999999995s)]
*  Right? [[01:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=4486.8s)]
*  You can get, oh dude, you can get somebody to deliver you like a damn power tools at midnight, [[01:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=4487.52s)]
*  but I can't get somebody to come over and relieve my cousin Ricky or something at two in the [[01:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=4493.6s)]
*  afternoon. I totally agree with you though. [[01:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=4500.0s)]
*  They do that in Holland. You know how Holland's ahead on all this stuff? They would, they do that, [[01:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=4502.8s)]
*  I think, in Belgium probably. [[01:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=4508.8s)]
*  Bring that up if anybody's milking. I don't know what the term is really. [[01:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=4510.88s)]
*  If some people are exasperating the- [[01:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=4515.44s)]
*  There is like, I think it's called, there is a word for, there's a polite word. [[01:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=4518.08s)]
*  There's a kind of medical word that makes it sound okay. [[01:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=4522.32s)]
*  Something very British, yeah. If people are- [[01:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=4524.5599999999995s)]
*  Yeah, manual relief or assisted ejaculation. [[01:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=4528.48s)]
*  Assisted ejaculation. Bring that up. Actually, no, that's gonna fucking- [[01:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=4534.08s)]
*  And I'm 22 days off of pornography right now, so- [[01:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=4539.759999999999s)]
*  Are you? [[01:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=4542.16s)]
*  Thank you. Thank God. [[01:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=4543.12s)]
*  But how does that- [[01:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=4544.320000000001s)]
*  As long as I've been in a long time. [[01:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=4545.04s)]
*  How does that feel? And you're in a hotel too. Are you in a B&B? [[01:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=4546.08s)]
*  I'm in a hotel. Oh yeah. It doesn't matter what kind of place I'm in, I'll bust. [[01:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=4551.12s)]
*  But I haven't been. [[01:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=4557.76s)]
*  Why not? [[01:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=4558.88s)]
*  22 days off of masturbation, something like that, and off of pornography. [[01:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=4559.92s)]
*  I just have gotten into this other program. I have a kind of a, I got to check in and make [[01:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=4565.52s)]
*  sure just like, I just don't want to do it anymore. I wasn't having a problem with it, [[01:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=4570.24s)]
*  but it just had been a long part of my life where it's like, oh, this is habitual and I don't like it. [[01:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=4575.04s)]
*  How does it make you feel not doing it? [[01:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=4579.92s)]
*  It makes me feel more empowered and it makes me feel proud. [[01:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=4582.639999999999s)]
*  Like a little bit, there's a part of me that makes me feel proud of myself. Is that crazy? [[01:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=4585.84s)]
*  You could get a bumper sticker or something. I wonder the best way of honoring that. [[01:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=4593.12s)]
*  Like I was a little too hot. [[01:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=4596.96s)]
*  Proudly, what is it? Proudly 50 days non-jacking off. What would be, [[01:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=4601.68s)]
*  yeah, is there a support group for that? [[01:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=4607.12s)]
*  There are. There is. Yeah. Cause a lot of it's just about like just making sure you're not [[01:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=4609.12s)]
*  looking at pornography. I just want that stuff influencing my thoughts and feelings. Cause then [[01:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=4614.400000000001s)]
*  you start to like whenever it intrudes into daily life. 100%. Well, when you're engaged in sex, [[01:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=4618.400000000001s)]
*  you think of it in like frames of shot. You're not even involved in like a real connection with [[01:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=4623.84s)]
*  someone, you know? And after years of that and stuff, it's just, for me, it was really unhealthy. [[01:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=4628.8s)]
*  So what are your vices now then? [[01:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=4633.68s)]
*  Vaping probably, drawing pictures of tits. A lot of times, like if I'm sitting around and I'm with [[01:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=4635.84s)]
*  a napkin or something, I notice I'll just look down and suddenly there's like six or seven [[01:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=4641.4400000000005s)]
*  sets of breasts or whatever, tits or whatever. Some people call them tits. I call them that. [[01:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=4646.16s)]
*  Um, what else? Having some chocolates probably. [[01:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=4650.96s)]
*  Not drink, you don't drink at all. What about, are you California sober? [[01:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=4654.719999999999s)]
*  You know that term. [[01:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=4659.92s)]
*  Yeah. You can still smoke pot. [[01:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=4661.04s)]
*  Yeah. And take mushrooms too. [[01:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=4662.4s)]
*  No, I've done like the micro dosing or whatever and I've done ayahuasca, you know? [[01:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=4664.16s)]
*  Have you? [[01:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=4668.4s)]
*  And that's really fascinating. That's fascinating. Did you want to see something you never thought [[01:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=4668.88s)]
*  could happen on earth? Go try that. It's like getting abducted by aliens. It's almost as crazy [[01:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=4673.04s)]
*  as that. [[01:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=4677.92s)]
*  I was scared. You've never been abducted by aliens. [[01:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=4678.16s)]
*  I don't know. Which is I think any good man should answer, Louis. [[01:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=4681.84s)]
*  Right. It's possible. I'm a little scared of the ayahuasca because the people I've spoken to, [[01:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=4688.16s)]
*  they're like, yeah, it is really heavy. And they'll say, and the person next to me, [[01:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=4693.84s)]
*  they were like, it was a pretty good trip, but the person next to me was screaming [[01:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=4698.16s)]
*  and thought they were dying. So that kind of harshed my mellow a little bit. And I'm thinking, [[01:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=4701.76s)]
*  I might be that guy. [[01:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=4707.84s)]
*  Yeah. That person could have also just been Scottish as well, you know? Because I know they [[01:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=4709.04s)]
*  can get very verbose at times. [[01:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=4713.04s)]
*  Do you think so? [[01:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=4715.4400000000005s)]
*  Yeah. The Scots. Well, the whole thing's fascinating to me about the British. [[01:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=4716.4800000000005s)]
*  No, I think you would love it, man. [[01:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=4721.04s)]
*  Did we get anything on car fentanyl? 10,000 times more powerful than morphine. [[01:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=4722.8s)]
*  A hundred times more potent than fentanyl. I told you. [[01:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=4728.4800000000005s)]
*  The presence of car fentanyl in the illicit US drug markets is cause for concern as. [[01:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=4732.16s)]
*  And that's the nice thing. If you're going to do cocaine, come to England. [[01:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=4736.24s)]
*  What's the look at the chemical formula is C24H20N203. I mean. [[01:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=4739.92s)]
*  Look up a little bit more car fentanyl. Go to Wikipedia right there. [[01:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=4746.96s)]
*  Who would you would just have to walk past it. [[01:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=4750.5599999999995s)]
*  Effects and side effects in humans are similar to those of other opioids and include euphoria, [[01:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=4753.5199999999995s)]
*  relaxation, pain relief, pupil constriction, sedation, slowed heart rate, low blood pressure, [[01:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=4758.24s)]
*  lower body temperature. You know, a lot of people choke to death when they take these drugs because [[01:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=4764.96s)]
*  they then they're on it. They think they're okay. They eat the muscles in their throat. Don't work. [[01:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=4770.240000000001s)]
*  Right. And then they choke and they choke to death. [[01:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=4775.92s)]
*  So you just imagine you're having a piece of chicken and you love it [[01:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=4779.120000000001s)]
*  and you can't swallow it. You tried to swallow it. You did the normal [[01:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=4785.360000000001s)]
*  go. Your fucking neck is breaks down. [[01:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=4788.96s)]
*  That's hideous. You don't, you wouldn't be that hungry. You know what I mean? Like [[01:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=4794.08s)]
*  it's like, I'm, I'm, I'm higher than I've ever been, but what I really want is a chicken sandwich. [[01:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=4799.76s)]
*  Seems a strange, you know what I mean? Yeah, it really does. I'm still not happy. [[01:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=4807.68s)]
*  Yeah. I don't know. [[01:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=4813.28s)]
*  No, I think, yeah, that's a very, but every now and then you'll be shocked sometimes when [[01:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=4815.68s)]
*  you'll try to do some food when you're on. You have this surprise. You're like, Oh, I didn't expect [[01:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=4819.92s)]
*  that's the worst. I remember I'd be all coked up or something and make a nice meal and then I want [[01:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=4825.200000000001s)]
*  to eat it. Just fucking do more drugs. But it's exciting being on Netflix with the doc. And [[01:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=4829.52s)]
*  for us, like it took us six years to make this. I mean, that was just, and I entered, I joined [[01:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=4837.6s)]
*  Nick, like Nick had already been, the director had already been making it for a couple of years. [[01:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=4843.2s)]
*  So like, it's an eight, nine year journey. And to finally land it, not just in the UK, [[01:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=4847.5199999999995s)]
*  cause it came out here first, but on a big stream of like Netflix feels big for us. It feels like a [[01:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=4852.8s)]
*  thrill. And you've got your specials on Netflix. They're the big game. They're the big game in town [[01:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=4858.72s)]
*  now. Yeah, they're good. It's definitely, you have a good experience with them. Yeah, I think so. [[01:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=4864.48s)]
*  They actually made us, they told the fans like they were coming to shoot at this, [[01:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=4869.04s)]
*  at the comedy special, the last one that they had to have COVID vaccinations like the day, [[01:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=4873.6s)]
*  like literally three days before last time. So, or maybe even no joke, two days before. [[01:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=4878.24s)]
*  And I thought that that was kind of fucking weird. Yeah. So everyone, so it wasn't enough that you [[01:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=4884.08s)]
*  get tested. You actually had to get vaxxed. Right. And so that made a lot of people be like, fuck them. [[01:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=4890.24s)]
*  People love Netflix, but at the same, cause we're addicted to it. But at the same time, I think [[01:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=4898.08s)]
*  people there's, well, here's one of the things I noticed personally. Like, so I went to the last [[01:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=4902.72s)]
*  blockbuster. You ever have blockbuster videos here? Of course. Beautiful places. I used to use it a [[01:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=4908.16s)]
*  lot. That was Netflix before Netflix. 100%. And it's still functioning. You can go in there. It [[01:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=4912.639999999999s)]
*  looks just like the ones you used to have. There's a kind of disgruntled person behind the desk. [[01:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=4917.679999999999s)]
*  One thing I noticed about that blockbuster is the autonomy you have when you're, I don't know if [[01:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=4921.76s)]
*  all time is worth, but the amount of just you, when you're walking around looking, there's so [[01:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=4926.8s)]
*  many options of things to look at and see. You're like, Oh, I forgot about this. I'd love to see [[01:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=4931.6s)]
*  this. Look at this. What about this? Whereas once you get onto one of the streamers, it's really [[01:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=4936.24s)]
*  only what they want you to see. Like you have to, unless you know exactly what you're looking for. [[01:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=4942.24s)]
*  Right. But before, but it's so hard for our brain to keep all that catalog. So for them to have all [[01:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=4946.56s)]
*  that catalog, but you don't really get to peruse it really. It was a total different experience. [[01:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=4952.16s)]
*  And the joy you felt kind of finding something a little bit physically like, Oh, let's watch this [[01:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=4958.96s)]
*  and things you never even thought existed anymore. So then you kind of get channeled into only what [[01:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=4965.599999999999s)]
*  is happening now in a way. So I think it's also going to be tougher for movies to become classics [[01:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=4971.28s)]
*  or like build up that indie fervor. Sometimes you're definitely a victim of the algorithm [[01:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=4978.08s)]
*  and that's a soft kind of influence. It's not censorship, obviously, but what it is, is a kind [[01:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=4984.0s)]
*  of curating of your experience. Obviously they want you to watch as much as possible. So they [[01:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=4989.44s)]
*  don't want to feed you things you don't like, but it keeps you in your lane a little bit is the risk. [[01:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=4993.599999999999s)]
*  But maybe they'll have like, when they get further along with things like VR, you will be able to [[01:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=5000.5599999999995s)]
*  go inside the TV and look around on the shelves. Don't you think? [[01:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=5007.12s)]
*  You would hope that that's what they're headed towards because yeah, just that experience was so, [[01:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=5012.8s)]
*  it just brought me back to, Oh, I have some say in what I choose. Whereas this felt like I don't have [[01:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=5017.36s)]
*  as much. I was one of those guys who would rent something and then weeks would go by and I would [[01:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=5023.4400000000005s)]
*  still not have watched it. I think I had Blade Runner for like three weeks. That gets expensive. [[01:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=5029.92s)]
*  Oh yeah, it would stack up and you'd be embarrassed taking it back. [[01:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=5036.88s)]
*  And you'd say, give me a, come on, give me a break. And sometimes they would [[01:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=5040.64s)]
*  bring it down a little bit. Sometimes they give you some snowcaps or something like, [[01:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=5044.4800000000005s)]
*  I need a fucking financial break here. But you remember like when they, [[01:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=5048.16s)]
*  you're probably too young, but when videos first came along and it was a new technology, [[01:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=5051.68s)]
*  it was kind of like before Blockbuster, everyone, everyone thought I could make money with it. So [[01:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=5056.24s)]
*  you would pop into the dry cleaners and then have a little V a video section or your, or the, [[01:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=5061.84s)]
*  the seven 11 or like the local candy shop, right? And, and they'd have a little like 15 video [[01:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=5067.84s)]
*  library. You know what I mean? I didn't even know that it was weird. That's awesome. And then there [[01:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=5074.56s)]
*  was a winnowing and they're like, you know, we should, this is ridiculous. We need to have some [[01:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=5078.8s)]
*  place that just does that. We had a place called Pat's Shrimp and Video, and you could get you a [[01:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=5083.360000000001s)]
*  pound of shrimp and get you a movie over there. Yeah. It was nice to get you a little bit of [[01:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=5088.24s)]
*  shrimp, get you a little film or something. You know what you'll find over here is that I think [[01:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=5093.36s)]
*  the chocolate's a little bit better. And if you go in, I know disrespect and maybe they're one of [[01:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=5096.88s)]
*  your sponsors, but Hershey Hershey's chocolate, I'm not a big fan of. And neither honestly, [[01:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=5101.2s)]
*  and I'll say that out loud. Yeah. Come on. Fuck those guys. Well, it's just shit chocolate. What [[01:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=5106.96s)]
*  are you fucking making for people? I think I actually think, and you can check this, [[01:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=5111.44s)]
*  they could not legally sell that as chocolate in the EU because they'd be like, there's not [[01:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=5117.12s)]
*  enough chocolate in the chocolate. Right? I'm serious. Oh, a hundred percent. You know, [[01:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=5122.8s)]
*  because the cocoa content would be, they'd be like, this is Vege-a-let. We can call it Vege-a-let. [[01:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=5127.04s)]
*  If you want to call it Hershey's Vege-a-let, but we can't call it chocolate. Yeah. Because it [[01:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=5130.72s)]
*  is very sweet, but it doesn't have the richness. Yeah. Like we can call it African American butter, [[01:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=5136.4s)]
*  if you want, you know, and like, well, it doesn't need to be racialized. We just need it to be [[01:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=5141.04s)]
*  actual chocolate. You know, you would think though also in America that has had a lot of [[01:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=5146.0s)]
*  history with African Americans, you think at least they would put the appropriate amount [[01:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=5150.96s)]
*  of African American in the chocolate, dude. That's the kind of shit that pisses me off. [[01:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=5156.4s)]
*  Hershey's lawsuit sparked British revolt for superior Cadbury chocolate. But I will say this, [[01:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=5162.64s)]
*  when you walk into some of the chocolatiers that are in Britain, it feels like you are. Oh yeah. [[01:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=5167.6s)]
*  It feels regal. It feels royal. It feels imperial. And if you go to Belgium, [[01:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=5173.68s)]
*  forget about it. Really? Yes. I mean, it's ridiculous. Like it's actually, it's like being [[01:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=5178.0s)]
*  in Tiffany's, like a jewelry store. It's so redolent of class and kind of gourmet values. [[01:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=5184.08s)]
*  And the things are exquisite. Like they just make beautiful objects out of the chocolate. [[01:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=5193.280000000001s)]
*  Presentations, yeah. The presentation is off the scale. [[01:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=5199.4400000000005s)]
*  Have you tried Revels? Do you know what? Try some Revels while you're over here. [[01:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=5202.799999999999s)]
*  Is it good? It's a mixture of different, I just like, [[01:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=5206.24s)]
*  you don't know what you're going to get when you put your hand in. And then they used to have, [[01:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=5209.84s)]
*  like they have a raisin one, like a crunchy honeycomb one. There'd be an orange one, [[01:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=5213.759999999999s)]
*  a coffee one. And they used to have a peanut one. And then they had to, they discontinued that [[01:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=5220.719999999999s)]
*  because of the allergy issues. Yeah. But those people, we don't need them on earth, I think. [[01:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=5227.2s)]
*  People would say that the joke was like, you know, people with allergies would use it like [[01:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=5232.4s)]
*  it was Russian roulette. Oh, I love that. [[01:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=5236.48s)]
*  You know, I have one, I don't know if this is going to kill me or not. The thrill. I don't [[01:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=5238.5599999999995s)]
*  know if anyone actually would do that, but a little part, I'm not going to be the guy who's like, [[01:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=5242.96s)]
*  is health and safety gone mad? I mean, we don't want people to die from eating a chocolate, [[01:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=5247.04s)]
*  but a little part of me was like, well, so we can't have fucking peanut Revels anymore. [[01:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=5252.0s)]
*  Just because. That's a huge part. I think at a certain [[01:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=5257.599999999999s)]
*  point you have to go with the status quo. I was in a movie theater once and I was, [[01:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=5260.0s)]
*  I had my, I think I had pick and mix. You know what that is? Okay. You just select [[01:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=5265.6s)]
*  different sweets and candies, you know, a bit of them, bit of them, but you make your own bag. [[01:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=5272.16s)]
*  Okay. I was like, this is going to be, and I sat down to eat the sweets and the woman in front of [[01:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=5277.2s)]
*  me and says, sorry, just to say, my son has a peanut allergy. So if you wouldn't eat any of [[01:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=5282.08s)]
*  your sweets, I'd appreciate it. So of course I'm like, oh, of course. Yeah. Not a problem. [[01:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=5288.32s)]
*  I don't want someone to die because of me in the theater, but, but I was also thinking like, [[01:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=5297.92s)]
*  wow, I can't eat my sweets. Yeah, dude. That's in what, who do they think you are? John Wilkes [[01:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=5303.36s)]
*  booth or something. It's not your fucking responsibility to keep this kid alive. It's [[01:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=5311.44s)]
*  her responsibility. What if I go and sit over there? Nope. No, that's not good enough. [[01:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=5317.2s)]
*  Okay. Dude. Yeah. That kind of stuff. You know what I did? And we can cut this bit out. No, [[01:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=5323.28s)]
*  we'll keep it in. I went to the, I went to far away in the theater and then I ate them. Yeah. [[01:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=5327.92s)]
*  And did part of you eat them out of spite almost in a bit? Of course. No, I ate them because I [[01:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=5333.76s)]
*  wanted to eat them. Yeah. But some of you with each one, you were like, oh, that little motherfucker [[01:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=5337.84s)]
*  couldn't handle these. Yeah. You're just firing them over towards him. Um, let me think about [[01:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=5342.4s)]
*  what else. Oh, do you think, um, what's on your mind these days? Will be like, what's, what's [[01:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=5350.5599999999995s)]
*  something when you think about a podcast, uh, on Spotify, I went the Rogan route. Are you on [[01:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=5354.799999999999s)]
*  Spotify? Yes. Are you, but you're only on Spotify. No, I don't, I don't own, I don't have a deal, [[01:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=5359.679999999999s)]
*  but they can put you on there and they don't pay you. Nope. Wow. I know you're making it [[01:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=5365.5199999999995s)]
*  sound like a horrible situation, but we are all, but we just put it on there just to be everywhere. [[01:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=5370.24s)]
*  Yeah. You're not a Spotify pod. I'm a Spotify podcast. Oh, nice. The Louis Theroux podcast. [[01:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=5374.8s)]
*  So I've been doing that. Um, and then I've got new shows coming up. I've got stuff that's on, [[01:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=5382.0s)]
*  oh, I mean, my big thing is I diversified. So I started making more stuff behind the scenes. [[01:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=5388.4s)]
*  So I've got a series. Do you remember the challenger, um, explosion? Yeah. A lot of people [[01:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=5393.92s)]
*  said those people are still alive recently. Where are they? Huh? Where would they be? [[01:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=5399.04s)]
*  Bring some of that up. People have been saying that. Can you say challenger people still alive? [[01:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=5403.92s)]
*  We, we did. Do you have it? Is this what yours is about? It's not about, but according to us, [[01:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=5407.5199999999995s)]
*  they're dead. According to our research, did I say challenger? I meant Columbia. Okay. Columbia. [[01:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=5413.28s)]
*  Sorry. I fucked up. Columbia is the one that was in 2001. Oh yeah. Those people are dead. [[01:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=5421.76s)]
*  The challenger people I think are alive though. Challenger is the one that exploded on takeoff. [[01:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=5428.48s)]
*  Columbia exploded on reentry. No. Yeah. And not only that they had, I wouldn't say they knew, [[01:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=5434.0s)]
*  but they had an inkling that something might go wrong and they decided not to tell the astronauts. [[01:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=5440.24s)]
*  No. And so the big, the question at the heart of it is what, what could they have done differently? [[01:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=5447.36s)]
*  Um, could they have sent another rocket up and taken, uh, take, you know, taking the people out [[01:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=5454.4800000000005s)]
*  in a space walk and bring them back home, you know, in, in, in the other rocket, like send up [[01:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=5461.28s)]
*  a Russian rocket. Right. Could they have fixed it down a space walk and fix the bit that they [[01:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=5466.08s)]
*  thought might be damaged? Um, so there's a lot of questions around how it could have been handled. [[01:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=5471.4400000000005s)]
*  So that, so I w I actually, I wasn't an exec on it, but my company made that. We're very proud [[01:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=5477.6s)]
*  of that series. Wow. Uh, and then we've got one about Lockerbie and we do a lot of heavy stuff. [[01:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=5482.08s)]
*  Do you know what Lockerbie is? Lockerbie, that's not the Loch Ness monster, is it? [[01:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=5487.92s)]
*  No, but it is in Scotland. It was, it was a village and a plane, it was a Pan Am plane that [[01:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=5491.76s)]
*  was flying from London to New York, I believe, and had a lot of American and British people on it, [[01:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=5496.64s)]
*  including a whole bunch of students from Syracuse university, I believe. And, um, it was bombed. [[01:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=5503.04s)]
*  And there's a lot of conspiracy theories around that or theories as to what happened. So we made [[01:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=5510.08s)]
*  a four part documentary that one's going to be on CNN. So anyway, I've been making a ton of different [[01:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=5514.64s)]
*  and it's a, I do do any behind the scenes stuff. Like, do you, do you have people you're mentoring [[01:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=5521.36s)]
*  or do you have like a production? Um, no, right now we've just been doing this sort of thing. [[01:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=5526.0s)]
*  Yeah. You know, I would like to, sometimes I think about doing some different, like I've had just [[01:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=5531.76s)]
*  some thoughts, you know, about stuff, you know, like sometimes maybe about like Alzheimer's, [[01:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=5535.52s)]
*  learning about that maybe. Um, I made a documentary about that. That's an interesting, yeah. It was [[01:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=5540.080000000001s)]
*  called Extreme Love Dementia and about the ways, uh, yeah, it's about how, how, how we can best look [[01:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=5545.4400000000005s)]
*  after people with dementia. Yeah. Um, yeah. A lot of them are very happy, like not to sound weird. [[01:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=5552.96s)]
*  No, I think it's fine if they think they're younger, a child or whatever, you know, I don't [[01:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=5558.56s)]
*  know, but it's just about making them okay and comfortable. You know? Yeah. You just gotta let [[01:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=5562.16s)]
*  them be them. I mean, that sounds a bit glib, but you know, if they say one of them was, he was a [[01:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=5566.72s)]
*  doctor, no, he was a dentist and he was in this memory support facility in, in, in Phoenix, Arizona, [[01:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=5571.84s)]
*  uh, surrounded by nurses and other very old people and fairly old people. And he'd been a [[01:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=5579.5199999999995s)]
*  military dentist and he was like, I'm on this base. I'm an, I'm a dentist. I'm doing something [[01:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=5584.8s)]
*  dental. I know that like, I'm like, really? You don't, you, you mustn't contradict them because [[01:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=5589.76s)]
*  that creates distress. Oh, confusion. You're like, okay. And then you change the subject. [[01:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=5594.24s)]
*  So he thought he was still working as a dentist, um, fixing people's teeth. And if he was distressed, [[01:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=5598.88s)]
*  you would say to him, um, Hey, Gary, would you mind taking a look at my teeth? And then he'd do, [[01:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=5605.2s)]
*  like he'd do a dental inspection and then he'd forget what was bothering him. So look, he's this, [[01:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=5610.56s)]
*  in this bit we can see he's trying to get out. He's like, I want to leave. [[01:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=5615.44s)]
*  I want to go through this door, but it says push and the alarm will sound and he's getting [[01:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=5619.36s)]
*  agitated. And then I'm like, Hey, Gary, you're always going to be an Indian. Would you take a [[01:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=5625.2s)]
*  quick look at my teeth? Yes, sir. I would. They're not very clean though. Well, I know. [[01:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=5631.28s)]
*  Yeah. I know. Why? Down, please. [[01:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=5638.08s)]
*  Good occlusion. [[01:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=5645.839999999999s)]
*  I know he's fine. No, you're a cross white back there. [[01:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=5648.08s)]
*  I wouldn't do anything about it. Cause I got to hurt you now. [[01:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=5652.24s)]
*  Oh, he might be. Yeah. It sounds like somebody that's checking in on animals too. Like he could [[01:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=5655.36s)]
*  be breeding dogs or whatever. Some of the commentary he gave there. Um, he's, but the point being he's [[01:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=5659.44s)]
*  you like, he's happy and he's living in his own world. And he's in a, he's in a fictional [[01:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=5666.4s)]
*  reality of his own memories. Yeah. And it's kind of amazing. I wanted to do something called like [[01:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=5670.56s)]
*  children of the porn, right? It was like children that were conceived on pornography sets during [[01:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=5675.84s)]
*  the shootings. Right. I think that's not many though. Do you think I think there's you got to [[01:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=5680.400000000001s)]
*  get at least seven or eight of them. You only need a decent batch to prove as well because [[01:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=5684.96s)]
*  that's so, you know, if you're a working porn performer, um, you're going to be doing at least [[01:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=5691.04s)]
*  three or four scenes a week, maybe more. Maybe not during a strike season. Maybe if you went [[01:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=5696.8s)]
*  and looked during a strike, during a scare when it's like someone tests positive and they shut down. [[01:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=5700.8s)]
*  So there were only a couple of shoots that year of that month. And if you, I don't know, [[01:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=5706.400000000001s)]
*  just something that I thought about. No, I don't. I don't have it. And I'm glad I don't. [[01:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=5710.96s)]
*  What else did I think about? Oh, morning sex, maybe a documentary about that. How did we get here? [[01:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=5717.76s)]
*  You know, um, like sex because you're bereaved and you're in morning. No morning sex. No, [[01:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=5723.280000000001s)]
*  you're talking about like funeral folk, like post funeral sex or whatever. I can't get out of my [[01:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=5729.84s)]
*  grief. Yeah. Like, um, but you mean sex in the morning, in the morning. Yeah. I just think, [[01:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=5734.160000000001s)]
*  I don't care what it is. It's just probably just, uh, I think fucking somebody right after they woke [[01:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=5740.8s)]
*  up is pretty sick. I think, you know, as in good, no, because sick means good. Oh yeah. [[01:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=5746.320000000001s)]
*  Well, I think it just, no, it went back. Now it's bad again. Yeah. Anyway, I'm coasting out of that. [[01:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=5752.4s)]
*  All of that stuff. Yeah. Yeah. I'm pretty old. Well, I think it just had also use part of you [[01:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=5758.799999999999s)]
*  loses interest in some of that. Yeah. Well, your penis, you've done all the tricks you can do with [[01:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=5764.639999999999s)]
*  it. I'm just trying to stay alive. Yeah. You know what I mean? I'm retreating. You know what I like [[01:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=5770.32s)]
*  gradually everything is it's about, we just need to focus on getting to the next day. [[01:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=5776.8s)]
*  Yeah. Do you feel, um, accomplished? [[01:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=5782.8s)]
*  Yeah. You're not supposed to say yes, but I do. I do because it's a really cool thing to say. I [[01:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=5788.5599999999995s)]
*  think it's important. I don't think I, you know, there's people who've done way more obviously [[01:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=5795.76s)]
*  stuff than me, but because I've been so lucky with, uh, the career that I've had, and I think [[01:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=5800.4s)]
*  maybe because of the, when I came along, it was like, there was various things happening in TV [[01:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=5807.5199999999995s)]
*  and documentaries and it was kind of like, it just, there was an opening, like there was no one who'd [[01:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=5813.839999999999s)]
*  done kind of like, well, there was just wasn't that guy like that. He's kind of a little bit [[01:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=5820.16s)]
*  cerebral, but he likes to joke around and he's curious about this and he's a good listener and [[01:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=5826.96s)]
*  he makes, and then the BBC gave me like, they're just like, just keep making those programs. They [[01:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=5832.88s)]
*  didn't really even check up on me. And suddenly like 15 years went by and I'd made 50 programs [[01:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=5837.2s)]
*  and I basically, I'd covered everything. I mean, there's still stuff out there, but there's so much [[01:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=5842.64s)]
*  I've cut. You know, I've done a prison, I've done jails, I've done a maximum security mental hospital [[01:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=5847.52s)]
*  for paedophiles. I've done most of the high crime areas, like I say most of, but I've done [[01:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=5853.68s)]
*  Philadelphia, Milwaukee, Johannesburg, Lagos. Uh, I've covered so much. I feel like I've had this [[01:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=5860.16s)]
*  huge privilege, this gift and, uh, it's pretty cool. I don't want us to sound weird. I don't [[01:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=5868.240000000001s)]
*  think it does. No, no, no. Well, it's just a lot of times, especially I think in the U S we don't [[01:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=5875.92s)]
*  feel that you never hear someone talk about, okay, I feel accomplished. But you know, [[01:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=5880.4s)]
*  it's always just like this never ending thing that is, but I'm trying to make myself okay with [[01:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=5886.0s)]
*  slowing down as well. Obviously by one metric, no, like I'm not, you know, I grew up in a household [[01:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=5893.44s)]
*  where we valued Shakespeare, me again, welcome back. And so for me, I accomplished, my dad's a [[01:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=5899.5199999999995s)]
*  writer. Yeah. Uh, he's a travel writer. He lives in Hawaii and also Cape Cod in the summer. And [[01:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=5908.72s)]
*  he's written like 60 or 70 novels and travel books. Like he's off the charts accomplished. Um, [[01:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=5915.84s)]
*  so, and you know, and the people we looked up to when I was growing up, people like, um, you know, [[01:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=5922.08s)]
*  just great literary figures like James Joyce or F. Scott Fitzgerald. John Irving. John Irving. He [[01:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=5927.68s)]
*  wouldn't have been, he would have been too close in age to my dad. So my dad would have probably, [[01:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=5934.32s)]
*  I never read John Irving, but if it was, let's say Hemingway or, um, Faulkner, right? Thinking [[01:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=5939.599999999999s)]
*  of mentioning a Southern writer, do you know who Charles Portis is? He wrote True Grit. Oh, wow. [[01:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=5947.04s)]
*  And he was from, I believe Little Rock, Arkansas. He's a Southerner and he's dead now. Brilliant [[01:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=5952.639999999999s)]
*  writer. He, everything he wrote is a kind of classic of a kind. So he, he was a, he wasn't, [[01:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=5958.08s)]
*  um, he was just someone who my dad was like, you should read Charles Portis. Like True Grit's well [[01:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=5964.96s)]
*  known, but his other books are equally good, if not better. So I read three of his books, [[01:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=5969.68s)]
*  but my point is just, and I totally recommend the one is called Norwood. Another one is called the [[01:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=5974.08s)]
*  Dog of the South. And, uh, so, so by, by that metric, no, I'm, I'm not accomplished cause I'm [[01:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=5980.48s)]
*  not, I'm not, I'm not a gifted writer. I'm just, uh, a TV presenter. I'm not even really a documentary [[01:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=5987.44s)]
*  maker, really. Like I'm not a director. I'm the guy who works with a director and we say, [[01:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=5995.04s)]
*  Hey, I'd love to go to a prison. And then the team says, we'll make that happen for you. [[01:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=5999.599999999999s)]
*  And they go and, you know, they figure out how we get in. And then we get amazing access for two, [[01:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=6003.28s)]
*  three weeks, right? Or in a cult or in a, or in the world of adult film or, or the far right, [[01:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=6009.12s)]
*  some far right group. Which are the right amount of curious though. But I'm curious. And in a sense, [[01:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=6014.88s)]
*  by being a little bit scattershot, uh, a little bit not ready for prime time, [[01:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=6020.24s)]
*  a little bit unfocused, maybe a tiny bit, I don't know what it may be ADHD. I'm not sure what it is. [[01:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=6027.04s)]
*  I don't want to medicalize it, but whatever that is, I get, I get impatient, I get twitchy. And, [[01:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=6032.24s)]
*  and then, so the people who are focused and on it can get me in there. And by dint of their work, [[01:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=6037.28s)]
*  um, I've created, uh, I've made, I've been part of making these programs. [[01:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=6043.44s)]
*  It's cool. Yeah. I've been trying to, I'm trying to row back from saying I'm accomplished. I've [[01:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=6048.88s)]
*  already regret. No, I don't feel, I feel like it's very lightly. I feel very lucky. Yeah. [[01:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=6052.4s)]
*  You very lightly say, well, most people view you as extremely accomplished. So I just think [[01:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=6057.2s)]
*  it's interesting to hear your thoughts on that. Um, the pedophilia, man, what'd you learn about it? [[01:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=6062.24s)]
*  Cause now sometimes people are saying that it's, you know, the next big business or whatever. [[01:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=6067.599999999999s)]
*  In what way? Like it's like the next apple computer or whatever. You know what I'm saying? [[01:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=6072.4s)]
*  Seriously. I mean, I feel like it's like in America, there's like, there's, there's that [[01:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=6075.84s)]
*  Nambla group. There's people trying to like legalize it. They're saying that the Romans, [[01:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=6080.48s)]
*  Romans did it. Yeah. Romans did it. Greeks, I think famously was Greeks, wasn't it? Um, and they said [[01:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=6084.719999999999s)]
*  that was normal in those days. And then, um, there was Nambla. I remember seeing a documentary [[01:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=6090.64s)]
*  when I was coming up, I used to live in New York and there was a place called Kim's video [[01:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=6095.84s)]
*  talking about blockbuster. Kim's was like the, it was way beyond blockbuster. They had everything [[01:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=6100.400000000001s)]
*  and they had every kind of film and they were organized by director. They'd be Kurosawa, [[01:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=6106.160000000001s)]
*  Spielberg, Jean Renoir, like, or like some obscure stuff that you wouldn't see anywhere else. You [[01:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=6111.92s)]
*  know, go into blockbuster and say, where's your Kurosawa section? They'd be like, you know, [[01:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=6118.8s)]
*  yeah, oh, sorry. We'll give you some snowcaps. [[01:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=6124.4800000000005s)]
*  But Kim's had everything. And in the nineties, when I was coming up, I was working as a print [[01:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=6129.68s)]
*  journalist and you go down to Kim's and it was like an education in film and they had a documentary [[01:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=6134.88s)]
*  section that had incredible, like one film they had that I want to mention, you may even have seen, [[01:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=6140.08s)]
*  it was called dream deceivers. Have you heard about it? It was about two kids who listened to [[01:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=6144.72s)]
*  a lot of, is it black Sabbath? No, Judas Priest. And they had a song called suicide solution. [[01:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=6148.96s)]
*  And the two kids decide like, they think the lyrics are saying suicide solution, just do it. [[01:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=6156.400000000001s)]
*  And so they're like, yeah, we need to, we need to commit suicide. I know it's very heavy. [[01:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=6163.360000000001s)]
*  And they, and they kill themselves. No. Yeah. And then one of them doesn't manage to do it. [[01:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=6171.68s)]
*  He just shoots off the lower half of his face. So he's interviewed in the documentary, [[01:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=6176.16s)]
*  I got to see that, but he can't really speak properly. And, and then Judas Priest are [[01:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=6181.04s)]
*  prosecuted by the kids parents, I think, say like, it's your fault. It's because of the lyrics. And [[01:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=6187.2s)]
*  then Rob Halford from Judas Priest is on the witness stand explaining like, it's not, you know, [[01:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=6194.08s)]
*  we just made a song. He said, he's from Birmingham, isn't he? So we just made a song and it wasn't [[01:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=6199.6s)]
*  supposed to tell anyone to me. I can't. You know what I'm talking about? Yeah, that's very fair. [[01:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=6204.88s)]
*  And it's a very, it's a, and I remember seeing that and thinking, this is so fucked up. This [[01:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=6209.76s)]
*  is exactly the kind of thing I'm really curious about. And it's dark and it's upsetting. And [[01:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=6214.4800000000005s)]
*  there's the kid. He's, he's died since then. Oh man. I got to learn about that. We just had [[01:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=6221.12s)]
*  a group on called the suicide boys and they, they had a pact when they were young that if they didn't [[01:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=6227.6s)]
*  make it that they were going to commit suicide, make it as white rappers. So let's just say the [[01:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=6233.84s)]
*  deck was stacked against them. But there's some, there's some pretty good, I feel like down south [[01:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=6242.08s)]
*  there's, is it Bubba Sparks? Bubba Sparks. He was on one time. Bubba Sparks is a really neat guy. [[01:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=6247.68s)]
*  Is he still going? He had some pill addiction. He still does do some work though. He still does [[01:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=6252.24s)]
*  work some, but there's a lot of, there's a lot of white rappers out of the UK now. Oh yeah. I would [[01:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=6256.88s)]
*  say white and black, very talented. In fact, the UK drill scene, central C, central C. Did you have [[01:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=6263.6s)]
*  him on? No, I thought about reaching out to him, but do it. We had Ed Sheeran and KSI and you, [[01:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=6270.320000000001s)]
*  and I felt like it was a good, that's a great mix. I feel like a very flattered to be in that company. [[01:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=6277.52s)]
*  What's the, I mean, I feel very flattered to be in the company. So, but on the, on the, on the, [[01:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=6282.64s)]
*  on the Kims, because you were talking about pedophiles being the next big thing in tech, [[01:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=6286.64s)]
*  which I didn't fully understand, but you're good. I don't know if I said that exactly. [[01:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=6290.56s)]
*  You seriously are the next Apple product. Oh yeah. I was just saying like, it's like, [[01:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=6293.360000000001s)]
*  it's become this hot thing in America. It's like, it just seems like they try to make it [[01:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=6296.88s)]
*  seem more norm. Like, well, so the thing was, I was going to say was there was this documentary [[01:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=6302.0s)]
*  that in this, in Kims in the documentary section, and it was about Nambla. It's called Chicken Hawk. [[01:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=6305.6s)]
*  All I was going to say on that was, so back in the day, Nambla was big. Alan Ginsburg, the poet, [[01:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=6310.72s)]
*  I'm not trying to like throw shade on him or whatever. Brilliant beat poet, much beloved, [[01:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=6316.24s)]
*  but he was a member of Nambla, I believe you can check that. But, and Howard Stern in the 90s [[01:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=6323.28s)]
*  always used to have, you know how he would have people on who, he had a Klan guy who would come [[01:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=6327.84s)]
*  on and he'd make fun of him. And he had a Nambla guy who would have on. So my point is just like, [[01:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=6333.5199999999995s)]
*  Nambla has been around for a long time. Chicken Hawk, Men Who Love Boys. It's a very weird [[01:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=6338.24s)]
*  documentary where they spend time with a couple of guys or one guy from Nambla and they're [[01:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=6342.72s)]
*  just talking to them, figuring out what makes them tick, what's going on with them. [[01:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=6347.92s)]
*  Did you confirm the Alan Ginsburg? Yeah, let's look back and just bring up Alan [[01:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=6353.76s)]
*  Ginsburg. I just want to make sure there were references. Yeah, we don't want to make someone [[01:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=6358.400000000001s)]
*  part of Nambla if they're not. Well, he was their celebrity, like they had one celebrity, [[01:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=6361.280000000001s)]
*  you know what I mean? Yeah. Association with Nambla was a supporter and a member. Good enough. [[01:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=6368.4s)]
*  It's a North American Man Boy Love Association. So was Michael Jackson in Nambla? [[01:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=6374.24s)]
*  I mean, I'm sure he definitely performed at some of their events. [[01:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=6380.08s)]
*  You would think, yeah. You know what, have you ever said, like I went on Twitter and said, [[01:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=6387.12s)]
*  come on, we all know Michael Jackson was a pedophile. We've seen the program and even [[01:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=6395.2s)]
*  before that, there was no shortage of evidence. His music's still great, obviously, but let's not [[01:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=6400.5599999999995s)]
*  be silly, but let's not be in denial about what's happening. And you get so much [[01:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=6407.76s)]
*  comeback on Twitter, on X from that. Does that surprise you? [[01:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=6414.639999999999s)]
*  No, I'll say, I'm going to tweet that as soon as we get out of here, just to remind people. [[01:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=6420.24s)]
*  I was really surprised. There's people who are still like, that's so shocking that you would say [[01:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=6425.36s)]
*  that about Michael. I'm like, what? Which Michael Jackson are you talking about? [[01:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=6431.2s)]
*  Yeah, dude, who are you talking about? [[01:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=6435.36s)]
*  I don't think they're trying to normalize, but my perception, when I went to Koalinga, [[01:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=6439.04s)]
*  it's a maximum security mental hospital for sexually violent predators is the term. [[01:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=6443.6s)]
*  And they go around in beige suits and it's a hospital, so they can't punish the men there, [[01:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=6449.280000000001s)]
*  right? It's a legal requirement, it's a hospital. So they're not incarcerated on the grounds of [[01:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=6455.360000000001s)]
*  serving a sentence. They've done at least two significant terms in prison for sexual offenses, [[01:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=6461.12s)]
*  and then two psychiatrists have said, yeah, we're not ready for you to come out. And they're like, [[01:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=6466.88s)]
*  hang on, I've done my time. What are you talking about? I've done 15 years. [[01:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=6473.04s)]
*  And they're like, yeah, but you're mentally ill. And they're like, I'm not mentally ill. [[01:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=6478.24s)]
*  They're like, I'm just a pedophile. That's their... [[01:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=6483.36s)]
*  Oh, I see. [[01:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=6486.4s)]
*  Right? They're like, I don't have delusions, which is, in a weird way, is a kind of medical, [[01:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=6487.28s)]
*  arguably a psychiatric gray area. [[01:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=6493.84s)]
*  Right, because they're saying, I know I'm a pedophile. [[01:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=6496.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=6498.08s)]
*  It's not like I'm in the, yeah, like, oh, I'm not a pedophile. [[01:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=6498.32s)]
*  Yeah. Or some of them are like, and I don't mean to be like, but they're like, [[01:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=6500.96s)]
*  I mean, because some of them are rapists. And they're like, but I'm a rapist. Why are you [[01:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=6505.04s)]
*  putting me in, like, but I did my time for that. And also, why are you putting me in with these [[01:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=6511.84s)]
*  pedophiles, right? And they're saying, I committed a crime, but that doesn't mean I can't... And like, [[01:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=6518.32s)]
*  why are you letting out murderers, but you won't let me out? But the argument goes like, well, [[01:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=6525.28s)]
*  because you're mentally ill, according to our metrics, due to being a pedophile. [[01:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=6529.76s)]
*  So anyway, so they're there and they're like, well, I'm not gonna... And if you spend [[01:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=6534.88s)]
*  long enough here and do enough treatment, we'll let you out. And they're like, no, you won't. [[01:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=6540.72s)]
*  So none of them, very few of them, proportionally, are doing the treatment. [[01:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=6548.320000000001s)]
*  But they can't be punished. So they play in jazz combos, they're playing tennis, [[01:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=6553.280000000001s)]
*  doing art therapy, they can have porn, they can vote. I'm gonna vote for Obama. You know what I [[01:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=6559.6s)]
*  mean? They're living lives like in... It's too strong to say country club style, but like a [[01:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=6568.56s)]
*  relatively pleasant mental facility. And everyone in there is a pedophile? [[01:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=6576.96s)]
*  Or a rapist. [[01:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=6584.0s)]
*  Or a predator, sexual predator. [[01:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=6587.28s)]
*  Sexually violent predator. The term violent implies like, oh, they beat you up, but some of [[01:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=6588.8s)]
*  it's grooming. It's a kind of legal definition of violent. And then they play softball, they play a [[01:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=6596.08s)]
*  lot of softball. Oh, wow. Now, if they live stream that, people would pay to watch that. [[01:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=6600.8s)]
*  And they sell their hair. Do you think so? I don't know. [[01:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=6605.36s)]
*  And a heartbeat. [[01:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=6609.04s)]
*  Why? Watching pedophiles play softball? [[01:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=6610.08s)]
*  It looks a lot like anyone else. [[01:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=6612.96s)]
*  Yeah, but still every now and then it's gonna get a little weird and people are like, [[01:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=6615.04s)]
*  oh, look at that. You'd be surprised to think of what people would pay for. [[01:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=6618.24s)]
*  I wouldn't pay for it, I don't think. I would look at the highlights or whatever if it was on [[01:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=6622.72s)]
*  sports. [[01:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=6626.8s)]
*  It would be like on ESPN5. Like one of the real... Lawnmower races. [[01:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=6627.2s)]
*  With the dog shows on there? [[01:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=6635.6s)]
*  Dog shows and lawnmower races. I'm saying lawnmower races like it's French, [[01:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=6637.04s)]
*  but that's probably mainstream. You know what I mean? Yeah, there they are. [[01:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=6641.04s)]
*  That's the worst. Do you think this is a born sickness or a learned thing, do you think? [[01:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=6646.24s)]
*  I would say, according to what I was told, a bit of both, I think. But I think there's a [[01:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=6651.28s)]
*  component where it's what they term a paraphilia. You can't actually cure it, the term cure, [[01:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=6658.4s)]
*  any more than any other. I was told it's like a sexual orientation, which isn't in any way to [[01:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=6668.8s)]
*  attempt to normalize it because it's just the idea is like, actually, this is just something [[01:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=6674.64s)]
*  they are. Not even how, something they are. And they need... And even like... And what they [[01:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=6681.76s)]
*  have to... And what they do is they convince themselves that there's no victims, like that [[01:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=6692.4800000000005s)]
*  the kids are okay with it. A bit like Michael Jackson, right? My theory with Michael Jackson [[01:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=6697.12s)]
*  is that the whole time he was trying to tell us what he was, like every interview, he would say, [[01:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=6703.28s)]
*  I sleep in a bed with kids. It's love. What's wrong with that? In other words, he was always [[01:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=6709.44s)]
*  trying to come out. You know what I mean? In his Diane Sawyer interview or his Michael... [[01:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=6716.5599999999995s)]
*  With Martin, his Martin Bashir interview, there might have been... Was there an Oprah one? [[01:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=6723.68s)]
*  He just wouldn't shut up about it. Yeah, I think it had to get... Yeah, he had to find some way for [[01:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=6728.32s)]
*  it to let people know. He probably was a nice guy who also had this affliction, you know? Well, [[01:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=6734.08s)]
*  that's the craziest thing about a lot of things. It seems like that you investigate a lot of the [[01:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=6739.68s)]
*  stuff you investigate or these people, it's not like they're... Some of them could be practicing. [[01:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=6743.04s)]
*  I think the kids took... I think it took the kids a while to realize they'd been abused as well. [[01:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=6748.4s)]
*  Yeah. They thought they were just having fun with Michael Jackson. I don't mean to sound like... [[01:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=6753.04s)]
*  No. Well, I think it's... You know what I mean? [[01:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=6758.0s)]
*  Yeah. Well, I think it all just goes to what you believe is okay. You know what I'm saying? [[01:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=6759.44s)]
*  Yes, in the bigger scope of things, yes, it seems it's really messed up and we were able to see that. [[01:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=6767.92s)]
*  But at the time, if you're there and you're in it and nobody's told you that it's bad or you [[01:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=6773.04s)]
*  haven't told anybody that it's happened... Can I tell you? I've never said this before, but I heard [[01:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=6776.96s)]
*  a theory that... You know Michael Jackson was on an episode of The Simpsons? [[01:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=6781.04s)]
*  I didn't know that. They pulled it. It was an uncredited [[01:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=6787.44s)]
*  guest cameo as a mentally ill man who thinks he's Michael Jackson. Does that ring a bell? It's a [[01:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=6789.76s)]
*  really great episode. You can't see it now. They pulled it. But the theory I heard was that he [[01:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=6796.72s)]
*  agreed to be on The Simpsons on the one condition that he could spend the night with Bart Simpson. [[01:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=6801.68s)]
*  So they had to write that into the script. No way. [[01:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=6809.200000000001s)]
*  So in the episode, he spends the night with Bart and they stay up all night [[01:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=6813.52s)]
*  writing a song together called Happy Birthday Lisa, I think. [[01:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=6821.76s)]
*  Oh, this looks like it right here. Yeah. [[01:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=6826.72s)]
*  I don't know. But it's... Oh, was it like, can I spend the night with Bart in the episode? [[01:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=6829.12s)]
*  Yeah. But because why would he do that though? Unless he's trying to in some way normalize [[01:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=6834.96s)]
*  adults and kids spending the night together. Unless he's trying to eat that, eat my shorts, [[01:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=6846.719999999999s)]
*  you know, or whatever. God, it's crazy. Yeah, that's what I wonder with like a lot of the [[01:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=6851.76s)]
*  Epstein stuff and stuff. It's like, are we... Is there this overall master arching thing that's [[01:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=6855.5199999999995s)]
*  leading us into this depravity world or did people always used to behave that way? I don't know. [[01:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=6862.5599999999995s)]
*  I feel like it was always... It used to be like, you know, in this country in the UK, [[01:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=6870.48s)]
*  we used to have page three girls and you could be 16 and be a page three girl. And, you know, [[01:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=6876.48s)]
*  it's arguably porn. Like they're topless. They don't do it anymore. But, you know, 16 is very [[01:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=6883.280000000001s)]
*  young. And to have that in your national newspaper, there's a topless 16 year old. They [[01:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=6890.0s)]
*  changed the law in around 2003. My point is just that I think in a weird way, it was more normal [[01:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=6896.56s)]
*  in the past to fail to fail to police in appropriate relation. Like there was more sense of like... [[01:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=6904.160000000001s)]
*  When you look at all the Roman Polanski stuff or stuff that was happening in the 60s and 70s, [[01:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=6911.44s)]
*  I think nowadays, I almost feel like the Epstein thing is a distraction. I mean, [[01:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=6917.28s)]
*  I might be being naive. I feel like they're trying to make out... Obviously he was a terrible guy, [[01:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=6922.719999999999s)]
*  right? Who was grooming and molesting teenagers. But I almost feel like they're trying to make it [[01:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=6928.0s)]
*  like make us all feel like there's this VIP and maybe there are, but I feel like it's all... Most [[01:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=6934.639999999999s)]
*  of that stuff's actually happening in... Look at the stuff that's going on in the regular porn [[01:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=6940.88s)]
*  industry. You know what I mean? They don't really need to hide it. Does that make sense? [[01:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=6945.28s)]
*  Yeah. Well, it's part of it. It's like, yeah, it's like... Well, I think it starts to make people [[01:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=6950.56s)]
*  think that, okay, the rich and elite are like... On the island? I don't really... I mean, the idea [[01:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=6954.88s)]
*  of the island is kind of appealing. Like, wow, what did they... And like... Right. Island always [[01:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=6960.400000000001s)]
*  adds mystique. Yeah. It adds a mystique. He had a private island. What are they doing out there? [[01:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=6964.32s)]
*  And then people would fly out there. I think they were probably out there just eating chicken [[01:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=6968.88s)]
*  wings and being rich. And it was probably quite boring. Yeah. You know what I mean? [[01:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=6973.52s)]
*  Unless there was a group of dudes... Because I've been around some real rich people and you start... [[01:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=6981.68s)]
*  A lot of them do like... They'll go on these kind of sex kind of... Really? [[01:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=6986.32s)]
*  Romps and tours. Nothing with... I've heard that and about some of the tech CEOs that they get [[01:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=6990.4800000000005s)]
*  together. And they go to Romania or just different places and do some weird shit. [[01:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=6996.24s)]
*  And shoot backpackers like in Hostel. Oh yeah. I haven't heard that, but I would... [[01:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=6999.84s)]
*  But they hunt humans because everything else is too tame for them at that point. [[01:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=7004.24s)]
*  Oh, I would believe it though. I believe that that goes on somewhere. Because they don't... [[01:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=7008.24s)]
*  Some people at certain levels, they don't value human life at all, I don't think. [[01:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=7015.2s)]
*  The scary part is, it's a bit like Squid Game. If you've got like a hundred desperate people, [[01:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=7018.639999999999s)]
*  if they were addicted to car fentanyl or something and you said like, [[01:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=7025.2s)]
*  what are you going to... You're all going to be hunted. Of the hundred of you, [[01:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=7030.48s)]
*  maybe three are going to get shot and killed. But the rest of you will make a great, like a [[01:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=7036.32s)]
*  really big paycheck. You would probably not have any trouble finding guys to agree. Don't you think? [[01:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=7042.16s)]
*  100%. I mean, in a way, [[01:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=7050.4s)]
*  it's kind of like what boxing is in a way. Because they're saying like, you're going to get brain [[01:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=7052.240000000001s)]
*  damage probably, or a lot of you are, but you'll get a great payday. And you can, until you're [[01:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=7058.08s)]
*  about 50, you probably won't notice a lot of the side effects. I'm not trying to be down on boxing, [[01:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=7064.08s)]
*  I've got tons of boxers, but we all know that there's brain side effects. [[01:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=7068.400000000001s)]
*  Yeah. No, man, just interesting to think about stuff. [[01:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=7073.4400000000005s)]
*  You know? It is. And... [[01:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=7076.88s)]
*  Did you ever get to meet Michael Jackson or no? [[01:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=7079.52s)]
*  I shook his hand. [[01:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=7081.52s)]
*  He did. What did his hand feel like? [[01:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=7082.4800000000005s)]
*  Very soft. It was the only time, I think... [[01:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=7086.0s)]
*  Yeah, you made a documentary about something about... [[01:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=7091.28s)]
*  Yeah, it was called Louie and Michael, or Louie Michael and Martin. It was around the time Martin [[01:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=7093.76s)]
*  Beshear was doing his interview and I was trying to get an interview. It's the only time I've done [[01:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=7100.88s)]
*  one where it was in search of. So I didn't get that close, but I did interview Joe. Joe was his [[01:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=7104.8s)]
*  dad, the one who he said messed with his head. Because Joe would call him all kinds of names [[01:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=7114.88s)]
*  that later on people alleged that was part of why he got his surgery. Because he would call him [[01:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=7123.12s)]
*  pepper nose. He said his nose... I'm not going to do an impression of Joe, that's a bridge too far. [[01:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=7128.88s)]
*  But he was... [[01:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=7133.6s)]
*  He was kind of a bully. [[01:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=7135.360000000001s)]
*  Then Martin Beshear got fired. He was the guy who did the interview with Princess Diana. Do you know [[01:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=7138.240000000001s)]
*  all of that? And then turned out he got it on false pretenses by forging a document. And that was why [[01:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=7143.76s)]
*  Princess Diana thought the intelligence services were snooping on her based on that. So she agreed [[01:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=7150.160000000001s)]
*  to do an interview with Martin Beshear. There's Majestic Magnificent. So he was Michael's personal [[01:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=7156.56s)]
*  magician. Wow. So that right there. So you could say like, what, that's the best you could do is [[01:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=7162.4s)]
*  talk to his magician. But you could also say like, well, who has a magician? That's pretty cool to [[01:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=7169.2s)]
*  have a personal magician. And... God, he must've been just so broken hearted or in so much self [[01:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=7176.24s)]
*  pity. He also and broken hearted. Who? Michael? Yeah. Or something just wrong deranged with him. [[01:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=7182.96s)]
*  He had to have a personal magician. You need someone... [[01:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=7188.48s)]
*  But Muhammad Ali had a personal magician. [[01:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=7190.48s)]
*  Oh, he did? [[01:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=7192.32s)]
*  Same guy, I think. Or maybe it wasn't his personal... I mean, he lived with the Jacksons. [[01:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=7192.799999999999s)]
*  I could never quite... [[02:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=7201.679999999999s)]
*  Is this guy still alive? [[02:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=7202.48s)]
*  He's dead, sadly. He was a good magician. Look at that. Do you see that? [[02:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=7203.679999999999s)]
*  And then Joe... My thing was I thought I said to Joe, what's going on with Michael? [[02:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=7211.679999999999s)]
*  The angle I went in was like, he looks like he needs help. He seems... He's a brilliant [[02:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=7218.639999999999s)]
*  artist, but he seems troubled. He's taking surgery, the surgery too far, and I don't see [[02:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=7225.839999999999s)]
*  a healthy relationship in his life. And in fact, the relationships he did have with Lisa Marie [[02:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=7232.719999999999s)]
*  Presley and what was the... Debbie Rowe? Debbie Rowe was the other one? [[02:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=7238.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=7245.04s)]
*  He was... She was like the receptionist for his dermatologist, Arnie Klein. I think that's [[02:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=7246.56s)]
*  right. Anyway, I was like, what's going on? Wouldn't you like to see Michael? And this was [[02:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=7251.84s)]
*  the slightly troll-like thing I did, although maybe not. I said, don't you want to see Michael [[02:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=7256.160000000001s)]
*  happy, like settled in a consenting and happy relationship with a man or woman? [[02:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=7261.120000000001s)]
*  And what did he say? I think I said boyfriend, a boyfriend or girlfriend. He said, [[02:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=7270.0s)]
*  boyfriend. I was like, yeah, boyfriend or girlfriend. Boyfriend. And then he went off. He [[02:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=7275.76s)]
*  said, you saying Michael's gay? You saying Michael's gay now? And then they kind of went off and [[02:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=7282.0s)]
*  freaked out that I might have suggested. That he's homosexual? [[02:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=7287.360000000001s)]
*  That he was a gay man. He was a homosexual man. [[02:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=7292.08s)]
*  He could have been. [[02:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=7294.56s)]
*  I think probably if he'd been able to channel his sexual energy into consenting relationships [[02:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=7295.4400000000005s)]
*  with men, then it's all good. I think of some pedophiles, when you meet them, [[02:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=7303.04s)]
*  the guys at Koh-a-Linga, they're not the most attractive men. What a surprise. And actually, [[02:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=7311.28s)]
*  when I've met pedophiles, I've interviewed them also doing prison sentences at San Quentin. [[02:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=7317.2s)]
*  A lot of times you feel like, okay, these are guys who have socially maladapted, [[02:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=7324.08s)]
*  who for them like to have sex with, I don't mean to belittle it or like in any way trivialize it, [[02:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=7328.64s)]
*  but that's just an opportunity for them because children are weak and easily influenced. [[02:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=7334.08s)]
*  Does that make sense? [[02:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=7340.0s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. No, it does. It's like some people prey on women that are weak and easily influenced. [[02:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=7341.04s)]
*  Some people prey on whatever they can that's weak and easily influenced or whatever they're [[02:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=7346.48s)]
*  able to assert themselves on. It's heartbreaking. We had a decent amount of pedophiles in our area, [[02:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=7350.48s)]
*  not enough to make a softball team or anything, but we certainly had a group of them around. [[02:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=7357.2s)]
*  In those days, we called them dirty old men, right? And it was called stranger danger, [[02:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=7364.0s)]
*  and it was tell your men to don't talk to strangers, or they were called flashes. [[02:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=7370.0s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[02:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=7374.48s)]
*  Do you know what that is? [[02:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=7374.88s)]
*  Oh yeah. I saw a flash once at a wine store when I was a kid. My uncle dropped me off at a wine [[02:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=7376.16s)]
*  store and a woman flashed me. It was a woman. [[02:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=7381.28s)]
*  A woman? [[02:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=7383.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=7383.679999999999s)]
*  And how old were you? [[02:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=7384.96s)]
*  Probably 12. [[02:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=7386.88s)]
*  But I remember, and were you upset by it? [[02:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=7389.5199999999995s)]
*  I don't know. It was kind of like by some, I mean, I've had an affinity for [[02:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=7392.799999999999s)]
*  Cabernet ever since. I know that, you know, for sure, dude. [[02:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=7399.36s)]
*  What does that mean? [[02:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=7403.84s)]
*  I don't know. It's just, I remember being in this wine store, [[02:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=7405.04s)]
*  and if somebody brings up a damn Cabernet, I fucking get excited. [[02:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=7407.679999999999s)]
*  Because you were in a wine store with her. [[02:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=7409.679999999999s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, she just, and I just didn't, and my uncle was driving me after, and I told him, [[02:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=7411.679999999999s)]
*  and he went back to the wine store to look for the lady, dude. What a fucking pervert. [[02:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=7415.92s)]
*  Because he wanted to see? [[02:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=7420.08s)]
*  For sure. He's a pervert, dude. His wife was on pills too. [[02:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=7421.52s)]
*  What was she wearing? [[02:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=7425.36s)]
*  Just a kind of a coat or something and nothing under. [[02:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=7427.04s)]
*  Was she a customer in the store? She worked there. [[02:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=7429.84s)]
*  I didn't look and see if she had a receipt or anything on her. I know she was not, I don't think [[02:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=7432.56s)]
*  she did not seem like an employee. So I think she was just somebody traveling around showing her body [[02:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=7436.0s)]
*  to children, you know. [[02:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=7441.4400000000005s)]
*  Did you like it? [[02:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=7442.24s)]
*  I was pretty. [[02:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=7443.84s)]
*  Were you confused by it? Were you upset? [[02:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=7445.2s)]
*  I don't think I was upset. I think I was like, all right. [[02:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=7448.719999999999s)]
*  All right then. [[02:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=7453.759999999999s)]
*  Oh, well. Oh, well. [[02:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=7454.799999999999s)]
*  Hello. [[02:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=7457.12s)]
*  Yeah. Oh, I didn't know if I, you know what I felt like now that I really, [[02:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=7458.0s)]
*  I felt like I didn't know if I was supposed to do something. [[02:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=7462.0s)]
*  Like, am I supposed to do something now? And then I felt like I didn't respond quick enough [[02:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=7465.12s)]
*  to maybe if I was supposed to do something. And then I felt bad about myself. [[02:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=7469.12s)]
*  A cousin of mine was, he was, this is his story to tell, but I'll tell it anyway. [[02:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=7473.2s)]
*  He was in Washington DC, not that that matters. [[02:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=7479.759999999999s)]
*  Oh, there was a lot of pedophiles over there. [[02:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=7482.799999999999s)]
*  And a guy called him over to his car, him and his friend. I guess they would have been maybe 11 or 12. [[02:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=7484.799999999999s)]
*  And the guy was in his car and he was exposing himself in his lap. But you know, [[02:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=7490.719999999999s)]
*  things happened quick and it was so decontextualized. [[02:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=7497.679999999999s)]
*  My cousin thought that he was showing him his gerbil. [[02:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=7500.48s)]
*  So he was like, oh, that's nice. Like that's cute. And then they went off. [[02:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=7504.959999999999s)]
*  And then afterwards they were like, hang on, that wasn't a gerbil. [[02:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=7511.28s)]
*  But you just wonder whether that was the reaction the guy was hoping for, [[02:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=7515.2s)]
*  you know, oh, that's nice. Or whether he would have preferred they were a little freaked out. [[02:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=7519.12s)]
*  Yeah. Like what the fuck? They call my penis a gerbil? [[02:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=7523.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=7527.2s)]
*  What an asshole. [[02:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=7527.5199999999995s)]
*  In a way, like that was the best reaction because I'm not, you know, I didn't phase him. [[02:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=7528.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=7532.5599999999995s)]
*  I had a guy come up to me once and he was, this was when I was 12 and it was, I was outside [[02:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=7532.88s)]
*  at WH Smith in Putney and he's like, and I used to like smiling at older people. I thought, [[02:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=7538.8s)]
*  I just thought it was. [[02:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=7545.5199999999995s)]
*  Yeah, you're supposed to do it. [[02:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=7546.639999999999s)]
*  Yeah. And like, you know, they're nice and you're nice. And sometimes they'll give you [[02:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=7547.68s)]
*  a little bit of money. Like here's 10p for being a good boy. Do you know what I mean? [[02:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=7550.48s)]
*  Yeah, for sure. He's a butterscotch or something. [[02:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=7554.08s)]
*  Yeah. Go get yourself some sweets. And then you go, oh, I can't take that. No. Yes, you can. [[02:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=7555.92s)]
*  Yes, you can. My family's all day. [[02:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=7560.88s)]
*  Yeah, I would. You go and take 10p. Here's another 20p. Buy yourself some sweets. [[02:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=7563.4400000000005s)]
*  But this guy's like, I smiled at him and he said, I bet you've got a big one. [[02:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=7570.4800000000005s)]
*  I said, I still smile because I hadn't taken it in. I said, [[02:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=7575.12s)]
*  I bet you've got a big one with lots of hairs on. [[02:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=7577.84s)]
*  Oh. [[02:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=7580.4s)]
*  And I smiled and then I went off and then I was like, oh, and he, I was quite upset by it. [[02:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=7581.04s)]
*  We used to have a dude, he'd give you 10 bucks, right? And he would, he'd be like 40 feet away. [[02:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=7586.56s)]
*  He would show you his butthole and all you had to do was look at it. [[02:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=7591.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=7595.360000000001s)]
*  And you got the $10. [[02:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=7596.64s)]
*  Isn't that amazing? That's a lot of money too. [[02:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=7598.24s)]
*  I thought it was a crazy amount of money. We're like, come back tomorrow. [[02:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=7600.320000000001s)]
*  How long would he be standing there for? [[02:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=7604.24s)]
*  Uh. [[02:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=7607.68s)]
*  It was just a quick like, okay. Or how did you know when he'd finished? [[02:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=7608.56s)]
*  He wasn't touching himself. He would kind of bend over and pull his buttocks apart. [[02:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=7612.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=7617.2s)]
*  And that's how he would see us and make sure that we were looking. [[02:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=7617.5199999999995s)]
*  Through your legs? [[02:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=7619.84s)]
*  Through his legs. Yeah. And we would kind of, um. [[02:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=7621.2s)]
*  Through his legs. [[02:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=7624.16s)]
*  He would show us his butthole. [[02:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=7624.96s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. I got it. Yeah. [[02:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=7626.08s)]
*  And you'd have to just do that. And then, um, yeah, you got there. You got 10 bucks. So. [[02:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=7627.28s)]
*  I had a, um. [[02:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=7633.36s)]
*  We had a lot of gays that would drug induced homosexuality in our area. [[02:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=7634.32s)]
*  And it was, they would happen behind like the rest areas along the interstate. [[02:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=7638.799999999999s)]
*  And the men back there would get in the river back there and make out and be high on drugs. [[02:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=7642.5599999999995s)]
*  Were they, were they doing it for the drugs or were they already gay? [[02:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=7649.44s)]
*  I think it was a mix. [[02:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=7654.48s)]
*  It was a big mix. [[02:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=7655.599999999999s)]
*  Because it seemed like guys that maybe weren't. [[02:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=7656.32s)]
*  All of that stuff's fluid. [[02:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=7657.599999999999s)]
*  Like guys in prison, right? And then you're like, well, you know, there's no gay men in [[02:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=7658.88s)]
*  prison really. I mean, they're all gay. There's no straight men. [[02:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=7664.0s)]
*  Depends on how you look. [[02:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=7667.599999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=7668.4s)]
*  Right? It's like, yeah, you might be in, you know, uh. [[02:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=7668.719999999999s)]
*  Sherwood for, you know, or where did Christopher Robin live? What was that place called? [[02:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=7672.96s)]
*  Sherwood forest. Robin Hood, Robin Hood. Yeah. [[02:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=7676.24s)]
*  You might be in the a hundred acre wood. [[02:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=7678.799999999999s)]
*  Oh, a hundred acre wood. Okay. [[02:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=7680.16s)]
*  Yeah. But you might not be a, you know, I don't know how to get an allergy. I can't figure it out. [[02:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=7681.599999999999s)]
*  But the, um, I went to the doctor once because my bum was itchy and it was a few weeks went by [[02:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=7687.36s)]
*  and then it was still itchy. And I was like, this is weird. Like, I don't know. [[02:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=7694.24s)]
*  Maybe there's something wrong with it. You know, you Google it and they couldn't find it. [[02:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=7698.88s)]
*  So I went to the doctor and I said, um, Oh God, I've got a very itchy bum. And, um, [[02:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=7701.52s)]
*  he's, I think he was French, but he said, I'll take a look at it. [[02:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=7708.080000000001s)]
*  And then he looked at it and then that's already quite embarrassing. [[02:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=7712.240000000001s)]
*  Oh, the worst. [[02:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=7716.400000000001s)]
*  And then I had the strong impression that he thought there was nothing. [[02:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=7717.200000000001s)]
*  He couldn't see anything wrong with it. So I had the strong impression. [[02:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=7720.96s)]
*  He thought I was just doing it for thrills. [[02:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=7723.200000000001s)]
*  And then what am I supposed to do about it? He said, I don't, he said, I can't see anything. [[02:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=7725.92s)]
*  I said, okay, well, thanks for taking a look. [[02:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=7730.64s)]
*  It was such an unsatisfactory. [[02:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=7734.72s)]
*  Oh, of course. And you can't call later and be like, Hey, can you let me talk to that guy again? [[02:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=7736.320000000001s)]
*  Apologize. [[02:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=7740.72s)]
*  Yeah. I just want to say, Hey, look, man, there was nothing weird because then that's weird. [[02:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=7741.4400000000005s)]
*  It's so hard to follow up. [[02:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=7745.4400000000005s)]
*  Have you ever had testicle problems where they have to look at your balls and then? [[02:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=7746.72s)]
*  No, I had erection problems though, where they would like shoot this stuff into your [[02:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=7750.96s)]
*  wiener to see if it worked good or not. [[02:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=7754.24s)]
*  And it works immediately, but it's, but literally the guy's like with a needle, [[02:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=7756.8s)]
*  just right into your wiener and it is harrowing, dude. [[02:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=7762.08s)]
*  Why did you, do you know why you had that? [[02:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=7765.92s)]
*  Just a lot of stage fright, just fright from being a kid, just constant nervousness, you know? [[02:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=7768.48s)]
*  And it would just like, yeah, that was harrowing, dude. [[02:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=7773.5199999999995s)]
*  So they just needed to find out that it worked. [[02:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=7778.8s)]
*  They want to know that it like the inner, the ballast tanks or whatever work, you know? [[02:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=7781.12s)]
*  And so they would shoot it up and you're like, Oh, it works. So it's in my head. [[02:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=7786.48s)]
*  It's not in my body, you know? [[02:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=7790.32s)]
*  And was it okay after that? [[02:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=7792.0s)]
*  Yeah, it was hit or miss for a couple of years, but it got better. [[02:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=7793.92s)]
*  Past few years, it's gotten better. Just to get older, things wear off, even like you're saying, [[02:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=7796.64s)]
*  like your desire, all that confusion, all the fucking, you don't know. [[02:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=7800.48s)]
*  The paint comes off the car and you're like, all right, we'll just keep driving it. [[02:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=7805.12s)]
*  Keep going. [[02:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=7808.96s)]
*  Some porn performers use that. [[02:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=7810.240000000001s)]
*  Oh yeah, shooting them up. [[02:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=7812.240000000001s)]
*  Yeah, they shoot it up, like, because that works every time and it's quick. [[02:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=7813.76s)]
*  I wouldn't, I would hate that though. [[02:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=7817.76s)]
*  They used to, I don't think they do. I think now the porn industry is so, [[02:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=7819.52s)]
*  like it's all only fans and private people and the big set where there's pressure on [[02:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=7824.160000000001s)]
*  and people are standing around. I did a documentary way back, one of the first episodes of my series, [[02:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=7830.400000000001s)]
*  and we followed a young guy called JJ on his first big shoot. [[02:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=7837.6s)]
*  And I'd read a lot about how people get anxiety and then everyone's standing around, [[02:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=7842.4800000000005s)]
*  thinking like, we can't shoot anything until you basically. [[02:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=7847.84s)]
*  JJ gets ready to run. [[02:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=7852.0s)]
*  You get wood, that's the term. And so, and we were like, we're going to be there filming. [[02:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=7853.04s)]
*  Okay, JJ. And I didn't mean really to put a hex on him, but because of the nature of documentary [[02:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=7856.8s)]
*  filmmaking, you sort of slightly, I don't know if even hoping is a strong word, but you are aware [[02:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=7862.72s)]
*  that you're going to, if you get, you're going to get a better scene if, if he fails to get wood. [[02:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=7868.96s)]
*  And there he was and he couldn't get wood. [[02:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=7875.04s)]
*  Couldn't get it. [[02:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=7876.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=7877.52s)]
*  Oh, was he talking to it? That's the worst when you start talking to your own penis. [[02:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=7878.16s)]
*  He was kind of, I don't think he was talking to it, but I remember a lot of the people, [[02:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=7881.52s)]
*  he was trying to get something going and it was just not happening. [[02:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=7887.12s)]
*  God, I've been there. [[02:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=7891.76s)]
*  What a nightmare. And you know. [[02:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=7892.8s)]
*  But nothing on the line. Like he had something on the line. [[02:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=7895.12s)]
*  That's him more recently. I saw him again. He lives in, he was living in Ukraine then, I think. [[02:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=7896.72s)]
*  Five years ago, maybe four years, but back then he was, he did, he made there, there he's like, [[02:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=7903.92s)]
*  he was telling me about his techniques and he'd done three scenes and this was his first, he was [[02:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=7908.88s)]
*  like, he didn't want to mess up on his first big studio shoot. [[02:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=7913.84s)]
*  It was his first big one. [[02:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=7917.28s)]
*  Yeah. It was a sad situation. [[02:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=7918.72s)]
*  That's a tough go. There was one thing I want to ask you about before we leave. Oh, [[02:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=7920.88s)]
*  they just had a social media ban. They wanted to put a social media disclaimer. I was looking at [[02:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=7925.04s)]
*  this. I want to see what you thought about this, Louis. Can you see that in the news articles? [[02:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=7929.4400000000005s)]
*  There's a social media, a surgeon general's warning on social media. Can you open that up? [[02:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=7933.4400000000005s)]
*  Oh, I heard about this. Yeah. Is that here or in America or both? [[02:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=7940.24s)]
*  Not sure. [[02:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=7943.68s)]
*  They're basically campaigning to put a surgeon's advisory or a kind of health warning. [[02:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=7944.32s)]
*  A surgeon general demands warning label on social media apps and they're trying to make it more [[02:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=7953.36s)]
*  sort of childproof so that actually 13 year old, cause you can get it like my eight year old got [[02:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=7958.24s)]
*  on TikTok when we weren't paying attention. We were on holiday. He started a TikTok account [[02:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=7965.04s)]
*  and then he was going viral. We didn't even know what was going on. [[02:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=7969.84s)]
*  Right. [[02:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=7973.36s)]
*  Jesus, really? [[02:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=7973.76s)]
*  We were just in a restaurant in Greece, talking about this and that. We thought he was just [[02:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=7974.400000000001s)]
*  playing on his iPad or something. And then the next morning, they came down and they're like, [[02:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=7978.96s)]
*  he's gone. My older kids were like, he's gone viral on his TikTok. And there was a picture and [[02:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=7984.96s)]
*  he filmed himself going blah, blah, blah, making a weird, like he obviously liked seeing himself. [[02:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=7990.72s)]
*  So he was opening and closing his mouth. And he goes, I like roadblocks. [[02:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=7996.8s)]
*  Was making a shape with his mouth. And then for some reason it kind of lit up TikTok. I don't [[02:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=8004.16s)]
*  know why. Cause I guess you don't see many eight year olds on there. [[02:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=8010.16s)]
*  Right. No, I don't think so. Yeah. You're like, who gave him this? How did he do it? [[02:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=8013.4400000000005s)]
*  People were giving him bad reviews. [[02:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=8016.64s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[02:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=8018.4800000000005s)]
*  And I'm like, like he was, you was getting like tens, tens of thousands, [[02:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=8019.280000000001s)]
*  you know, like more than a lot of stuff gets on TV. [[02:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=8025.280000000001s)]
*  And people would say, and then one guy was like, don't harsh on the guy. He'd just be [[02:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=8028.72s)]
*  vibing. Like kind of defending, defending his integrity and the quality of his content. [[02:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=8033.2s)]
*  That's crazy. The kid just started. [[02:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=8041.28s)]
*  He just, he was only his like third post. But I'm also thinking, you know, it's like having [[02:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=8042.88s)]
*  a portal in your pocket, like, or in your front room. I, you know, if you've ever, [[02:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=8051.76s)]
*  if you have like a million or a couple of million social media followers [[02:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=8056.24s)]
*  and then you have a few drinks, it's kind of, I often think it's a bit like if you had a balcony [[02:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=8059.92s)]
*  outside your front room and you could wander out and any, anytime there's 2 million people [[02:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=8066.4s)]
*  standing outside. So you could just go out there and I'm going to show them my wiener, [[02:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=8069.92s)]
*  you know, like you could do anything. [[02:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=8075.2s)]
*  Yeah. I'm going to show them and tell them what's up. [[02:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=8076.639999999999s)]
*  I'm going to tell them what I feel right now. [[02:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=8078.16s)]
*  Yeah. Oh, I got a great joke. This is funny. Like you can, and that's a horrendous, [[02:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=8079.2s)]
*  I accidentally, like also there's famous people in your phone and you go like, [[02:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=8084.24s)]
*  Siri, or you use the thing and it goes beep beep and like, I'm going to send a text to [[02:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=8089.759999999999s)]

*  And you're one thumb click away from sending something crazy, saying something crazy. [[02:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=8098.88s)]
*  And what if it started to do it? What if it started just like, you know what? [[02:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=8106.4s)]
*  Fuck these people, the algorithm, whatever. It's only, we're already calling it an algorithm. [[02:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=8109.5199999999995s)]
*  We're already calling it artificial. [[02:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=8114.719999999999s)]
*  Kids do inappropriate. I'm not going to call it anything, but kids take, [[02:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=8116.4s)]
*  they think it's funny to do inappropriate stuff. That's part of being a kid. Like they have a [[02:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=8119.92s)]
*  bath together and they, maybe they even, if you want, they have a phone and they think it's fun. [[02:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=8123.76s)]
*  Like they take a picture of, maybe one of them takes a picture of his younger brother, [[02:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=8128.88s)]
*  naked or something. I'm speaking hypothetically. [[02:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=8131.92s)]
*  Of course. [[02:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=8134.24s)]
*  Maybe they zoom in on his wiener, his willy. They think it's funny. Like, [[02:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=8134.5599999999995s)]
*  because they can show it to you or like to their, you know, brother or something like that. [[02:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=8139.599999999999s)]
*  I know why I didn't. But then one click, like, well, they have your social media account. They [[02:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=8144.08s)]
*  put it, put that on social media. Now you're a paedophile and you'll go to jail. [[02:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=8148.72s)]
*  Not even joking, right? That would be, I'd be put in prison for that. [[02:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=8153.4400000000005s)]
*  And who, what court is going to believe, oh yeah, my son took a picture of his brother's wiener [[02:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=8157.4400000000005s)]
*  and then he posted it. Exactly. [[02:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=8162.88s)]
*  Look, your four year old son did that. Exactly. [[02:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=8165.200000000001s)]
*  It's just that thing. That's at the risk. And then one thing like that [[02:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=8168.64s)]
*  is career, potentially career ending. [[02:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=8172.8s)]
*  And what if the actual owners of these corporate, if they wanted to, [[02:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=8174.72s)]
*  they could just post something on your fucking account. [[02:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=8178.72s)]
*  They can hack into your every, you're clicking all those, what are the terms and conditions? [[02:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=8180.72s)]
*  You know, you tick the one in Samsung, it was like, you have the permission to listen to [[02:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=8186.08s)]
*  everything I say. Yeah. [[02:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=8189.92s)]
*  Do you remember in the smart TV and they were stockpiling everything you said there, [[02:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=8191.28s)]
*  they're, their only get out was, oh, we're not listening to it. We'll only listen to it. If [[02:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=8196.8s)]
*  you get into trouble, like if the president thinks you're a spy, you know, or a terrorist, [[02:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=8200.56s)]
*  but other than that, don't worry. We're just collecting it. [[02:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=8206.48s)]
*  Yeah. Like, oh, fine then. [[02:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=8209.119999999999s)]
*  Right. I think that's still going. That isn't even a conspiracy theory. I don't think. [[02:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=8212.24s)]
*  Oh, I don't know. Did Samsung, can you bring that up, man? Well, you know, one of my, [[02:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=8216.24s)]
*  one of my beliefs is that a lot of porno pornography sites are able to record you [[02:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=8220.96s)]
*  while you're watching pornography. Yeah. [[02:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=8226.8s)]
*  So that's how a lot of these people get compromised. I think for all types of things [[02:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=8228.88s)]
*  is because they have video of everybody. Your TV spying on you, but you could stop it. [[02:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=8233.039999999999s)]
*  On newer Samsung, let's go to settings, support scroll down to terms and policies. [[02:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=8238.4s)]
*  Here you can turn off viewing information services, internet-based advertising. [[02:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=8242.16s)]
*  You can stop it. Yeah. But tell me how many people are going to [[02:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=8246.64s)]
*  click through all the menus to figure out. I just read how to do it and I'm still not [[02:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=8249.199999999999s)]
*  going to do it. Exactly. You don't even read the bit that's like quick start. Here's the thing. [[02:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=8253.199999999999s)]
*  You just like put the batteries in and if you can't figure it out with, you know, on its own, [[02:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=8258.0s)]
*  then you get someone else to figure it out. You assume it doesn't work. Well, [[02:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=8263.12s)]
*  even with having a child, people will have a child, not even read anything about them [[02:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=8266.08s)]
*  and just take it home from the fucking hospital. Yeah. Yeah. Big time. There's no manual, [[02:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=8269.36s)]
*  but you should do some research. You should do some research. [[02:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=8275.76s)]
*  They're not spying on you though. Well, maybe they are. That's when you know you're fully [[02:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=8279.12s)]
*  schizophrenic is when you think your children are. [[02:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=8284.16s)]
*  Oh yeah. There's a Shane Moss is a great comedian who he's like, he'd done a lot of psychedelics [[02:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=8288.32s)]
*  and he wanted to do a documentary while he was on psychedelics. But as he was taking him, [[02:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=8294.880000000001s)]
*  he got like further and further down the whole of them and he started to think that the camera [[02:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=8298.560000000001s)]
*  crew that he'd hired was spying and working against him. So now he started leaving clues [[02:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=8302.08s)]
*  to the camera crew. So whoever would be watching this on the other side would be able to come and [[02:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=8308.4s)]
*  help him. But to be fair, it would be quite normal. That sounds quite normal to think that [[02:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=8313.04s)]
*  like I don't fully, fully, fully trust any crew, any team I work with. You know what I mean? Oh [[02:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=8318.800000000001s)]
*  yeah. Because if you did something like horrific in a weird way, you would expect them to expose you. [[02:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=8325.12s)]
*  Right? Right. There's a part of them that would hopefully the hope that they would. If they caught [[02:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=8334.880000000001s)]
*  you, they were doing a documentary about you and you did, they caught you looking at animal porn [[02:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=8339.44s)]
*  or something. Then maybe that's a better story. And maybe they should be like thinking about, [[02:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=8344.960000000001s)]
*  we need to do this, like uncover. Suddenly their allegiance changes. It's no longer about [[02:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=8352.880000000001s)]
*  morning sex, right? The documentary about morning sex. This is more, we did go to like 60 minutes [[02:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=8360.16s)]
*  and think we have Theo Von looking at extreme animal porn. Well, so you can just go to any [[02:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=8364.88s)]
*  dog park and watch it for a little bit. It's not the closeups you want. Or David Attenborough, [[02:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=8370.16s)]
*  right? That's basically what nature programs are. Oh, the snow finch. Did you meet him? [[02:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=8375.359999999999s)]
*  I have met him. I interviewed him, not for TV, but for a magazine. Yeah. What a voice of the times. [[02:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=8381.679999999998s)]
*  Voice. Yeah. Soon it will die. It will be weeks before it feeds again. [[02:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=8388.32s)]
*  I learned a lot from how sparing he is. Like he uses the minimum amount of words in his voiceover. [[02:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=8396.16s)]
*  It's winter. The prawns are feeding. [[02:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=8405.52s)]

*  and there'll be some little rye and then time for a nap. You know, like you just throw it a little, [[02:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=8418.800000000001s)]

*  that was probably like the beginning of like, I was two years before the rot set in. [[02:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7SWhjMr4E&t=8439.039999999999s)]
