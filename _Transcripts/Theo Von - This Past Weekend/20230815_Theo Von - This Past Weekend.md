*  I'm [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vmIoMMRdKE&t=146.72s)]
*  The other night a guy was giving me directions [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vmIoMMRdKE&t=149.6s)]
*  And I pulled over and I was talking about something and he was explaining where something was and he goes [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vmIoMMRdKE&t=153.32s)]
*  It's right over there behind that [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vmIoMMRdKE&t=160.7s)]
*  and [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vmIoMMRdKE&t=163.24s)]
*  They had a lit up sign it said flea market. That's what the letters on the sign would say [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vmIoMMRdKE&t=165.0s)]
*  but some of the letters had were burned out and [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vmIoMMRdKE&t=171.8s)]
*  This guy was I don't want to say homeless but I would say [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vmIoMMRdKE&t=175.16s)]
*  semi homeless [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vmIoMMRdKE&t=181.84s)]
*  Or hadn't you know this guy probably I bet this guy hadn't been home in probably [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vmIoMMRdKE&t=183.4s)]
*  Probably 12 or 14 months [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vmIoMMRdKE&t=187.48000000000002s)]
*  so he was like a street, baby and [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vmIoMMRdKE&t=190.8s)]
*  So he was trying to give me he'd tell me where this place was that he'd went to and he goes it's right over [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vmIoMMRdKE&t=195.16s)]
*  there behind that [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vmIoMMRdKE&t=199.72s)]
*  and he sees the big [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vmIoMMRdKE&t=201.8s)]
*  sign [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vmIoMMRdKE&t=204.64000000000001s)]
*  On this kind of building space that says flea market [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vmIoMMRdKE&t=206.08s)]
*  But some of the letters were burned out. So it just said [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vmIoMMRdKE&t=210.6s)]
*  FL [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vmIoMMRdKE&t=214.88s)]
*  M and then [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vmIoMMRdKE&t=216.72s)]
*  Ket those were the letters you could still see [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vmIoMMRdKE&t=219.8s)]
*  So instead of just deducing that it said flea market the guys like well, it's you know, it's right over behind the um [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vmIoMMRdKE&t=224.24s)]
*  the um [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vmIoMMRdKE&t=231.72s)]
*  If [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vmIoMMRdKE&t=234.48s)]
*  Cut [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vmIoMMRdKE&t=238.88s)]
*  Right, it's right if he goes if you go right behind you see that that [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vmIoMMRdKE&t=241.24s)]
*  Cat [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vmIoMMRdKE&t=252.0s)]
*  Cat and I'm just think like how does this guy not know? [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vmIoMMRdKE&t=254.8s)]
*  That this sign says flea market [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vmIoMMRdKE&t=260.28s)]
*  Just the bread I mean he was like it's you just go behind the [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vmIoMMRdKE&t=265.48s)]
*  food [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vmIoMMRdKE&t=269.92s)]

*  Kurt [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vmIoMMRdKE&t=398.96000000000004s)]

*  We had to get to that bus stop [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vmIoMMRdKE&t=418.08000000000004s)]
*  And you know if you [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vmIoMMRdKE&t=420.72s)]

*  I've left you guys [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vmIoMMRdKE&t=428.40000000000003s)]

*  It was probably about two good real blocks away [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vmIoMMRdKE&t=446.64000000000004s)]
*  You had to go two full blocks to get to that bus stop maybe two maybe maybe two and a half blocks [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vmIoMMRdKE&t=450.40000000000003s)]

*  With a heavy backpack [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vmIoMMRdKE&t=505.68s)]

*  Because here's what starts happening you get going [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vmIoMMRdKE&t=518.64s)]

*  It's too heavy. It starts kind of wobbling too fast behind you [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vmIoMMRdKE&t=535.5999999999999s)]
*  Behind you [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vmIoMMRdKE&t=539.4399999999999s)]
*  So now the backpack kind of has like an energy of its own and you have to basically you almost have to stop [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vmIoMMRdKE&t=540.9599999999999s)]
*  Let the backpack come to rest [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vmIoMMRdKE&t=547.52s)]
*  And then get going again [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vmIoMMRdKE&t=550.4s)]
*  You know because you look like a fucking you look like a penguin. That's just you know [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vmIoMMRdKE&t=552.9599999999999s)]
*  That's done a gram or something. That's grahamed out, baby [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vmIoMMRdKE&t=557.36s)]
*  Um [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vmIoMMRdKE&t=562.24s)]
*  So that was always the most hectic was whenever you were late for the bus [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vmIoMMRdKE&t=563.36s)]
*  But you had that huge heavy backpack and it would just like it would start like it would come around to the side [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vmIoMMRdKE&t=566.0s)]
*  you it was so like [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vmIoMMRdKE&t=571.44s)]
*  Like it was crazy when you were seeing your backpack [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vmIoMMRdKE&t=574.08s)]
*  It would swing all the way almost in front of you on each side as you as the different legs of yours move forward [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vmIoMMRdKE&t=576.4s)]
*  you know [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vmIoMMRdKE&t=582.4s)]
*  Because it was just getting out of control and you have to stop and let it settle down [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vmIoMMRdKE&t=583.92s)]
*  And then you start going again [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vmIoMMRdKE&t=588.64s)]
*  So that was always that was harrowing to get into the bus that was a [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vmIoMMRdKE&t=591.92s)]
*  That was the toughest thing and then here's the crazy part as you are approaching the bus stop [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vmIoMMRdKE&t=596.56s)]
*  You didn't want to run because you didn't want people at the bus stop seeing you [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vmIoMMRdKE&t=602.64s)]
*  Run to learn [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vmIoMMRdKE&t=607.6s)]
*  Because that was the most nerd shit you could be doing like oh this dude running to learn [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vmIoMMRdKE&t=610.32s)]
*  We're gonna this guy is not this dude is a narc, you know, this guy is trouble [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vmIoMMRdKE&t=619.6s)]
*  This guy wants a future [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vmIoMMRdKE&t=625.8399999999999s)]
*  That was frowned upon [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vmIoMMRdKE&t=628.48s)]
*  So you would have to like hurry but as soon as people like were looking you couldn't he had to stop hurrying like [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vmIoMMRdKE&t=631.52s)]
*  I don't care if I miss it. I don't need to learn [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vmIoMMRdKE&t=637.04s)]
*  You know i'm saying bro education is for dummies, man [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vmIoMMRdKE&t=640.48s)]
*  Food my cat [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vmIoMMRdKE&t=644.3199999999999s)]
*  Food my cat [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vmIoMMRdKE&t=646.0799999999999s)]
*  So, uh, so then you had to kind of slow it it was just this crazy like [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vmIoMMRdKE&t=650.4s)]
*  In our neighborhood, it was just this crazy thing to get over there, you know [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vmIoMMRdKE&t=654.08s)]
*  It was this crazy thing [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vmIoMMRdKE&t=659.76s)]
*  And I remember one time somebody stood in an ant pile at the bus stop and somebody's daddy came out and um [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vmIoMMRdKE&t=661.9200000000001s)]
*  Put uh gasoline all over him [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vmIoMMRdKE&t=671.52s)]
*  To help him out or whatever [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vmIoMMRdKE&t=676.64s)]
*  Um [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vmIoMMRdKE&t=679.04s)]
*  But that was a crazy thing I remember about getting back to school [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vmIoMMRdKE&t=680.24s)]
*  It was just such a harrowing time going back to school was just such like a [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vmIoMMRdKE&t=685.68s)]
*  You know, you were going back to school. It was your that was where the world happened [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vmIoMMRdKE&t=690.48s)]
*  That was where you touched society [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vmIoMMRdKE&t=696.56s)]
*  that's where you learned where you had a chance at meeting a spouse or something, you know, or a [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vmIoMMRdKE&t=699.84s)]
*  whatever [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vmIoMMRdKE&t=705.76s)]
*  That's where it all it was like that was the [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vmIoMMRdKE&t=707.52s)]
*  the greek the center of of of [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vmIoMMRdKE&t=710.48s)]
*  Existence that was the nucleus. That was the core of your earth at the time going to school [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vmIoMMRdKE&t=714.06s)]
*  And yeah, then you'd get on the bus that was [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vmIoMMRdKE&t=722.0s)]
*  Dude I remember I get on the bus and it was scary at like you got on the bus [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vmIoMMRdKE&t=726.8s)]
*  And first I remember our bus was it was black and white children on our bus [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vmIoMMRdKE&t=733.9200000000001s)]
*  So first you had like these two chicks. They were both pregnant [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vmIoMMRdKE&t=739.76s)]
*  in each of the first seats the first seats was for chicks that was [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vmIoMMRdKE&t=743.84s)]
*  Pregnant or semi-pregnant, you know what i'm saying? [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vmIoMMRdKE&t=748.0600000000001s)]
*  um [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vmIoMMRdKE&t=752.08s)]
*  And so you had I remember one time we had these chicks we had tiffany and we had largesh [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vmIoMMRdKE&t=754.16s)]
*  And both of them they had been [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vmIoMMRdKE&t=760.24s)]
*  Somebody lit them up with that seedling baby. You know what i'm saying that zygote baby [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vmIoMMRdKE&t=762.96s)]
*  Somebody freaking you know [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vmIoMMRdKE&t=774.8s)]
*  Put that baby that uh, somebody put that goldfish in the bowl on them babies [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vmIoMMRdKE&t=777.04s)]
*  So you had them two then in the next seat you had like this brother this dude [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vmIoMMRdKE&t=782.16s)]
*  He had knocked both of them up [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vmIoMMRdKE&t=786.64s)]
*  So he was right there, you know this dude fucking inmate crandal I think was his name this bro he was [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vmIoMMRdKE&t=788.8s)]
*  You know, and that's a crazy name for somebody but that was the name they they knew about the jump this dude where he was headed, bro [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vmIoMMRdKE&t=795.76s)]
*  So that was it that you know, that was it so you had and I remember that dude for 50 cents [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vmIoMMRdKE&t=804.16s)]
*  He'd let you see his wiener [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vmIoMMRdKE&t=809.4399999999999s)]
*  or [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vmIoMMRdKE&t=811.92s)]
*  He would just show you his wiener for no money [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vmIoMMRdKE&t=813.84s)]
*  So he wasn't like the best businessman but [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vmIoMMRdKE&t=816.72s)]
*  But you had to see a little bit of wiener if you wanted to get past that second row of seats, right [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vmIoMMRdKE&t=822.72s)]
*  And that you know, that's just what it was like on the school bus [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vmIoMMRdKE&t=828.6400000000001s)]
*  So you had to you see the girls you kind of do a little prayer for them [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vmIoMMRdKE&t=832.0s)]
*  And the offspring or potential offspring you'd see inmate crandal you fucking nod at him [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vmIoMMRdKE&t=836.0s)]
*  Maybe peek that wiener if he was showing root [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vmIoMMRdKE&t=841.6800000000001s)]
*  You know and then the next seat [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vmIoMMRdKE&t=844.24s)]
*  It was like a mixed kid, right? [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vmIoMMRdKE&t=847.28s)]
*  And that was like, okay, this is [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vmIoMMRdKE&t=850.4s)]
*  Because when you were on the bus you kind of were walking past the seats so fast you it was hard to make choices [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vmIoMMRdKE&t=853.44s)]
*  Where do I sit? Am I cool? Am I not cool? [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vmIoMMRdKE&t=858.0s)]
*  It was almost like [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vmIoMMRdKE&t=861.52s)]
*  It was like where god put you in a filing cabinet [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vmIoMMRdKE&t=863.92s)]
*  Or where life puts you in a filing cabinet of how cool or how cool [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vmIoMMRdKE&t=868.4s)]
*  Or whatever your status was in the world at that moment [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vmIoMMRdKE&t=872.72s)]
*  Like do you sit by the kid who's playing a a game boy or a sweat? [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vmIoMMRdKE&t=876.08s)]

*  Sometimes you sit in the seat and they'd have a call, you know some weird kid in there, you know [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vmIoMMRdKE&t=886.64s)]

*  And I think it's going to be something that it's funny because would you want your kid on there [[01:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vmIoMMRdKE&t=3777.3199999999997s)]

*  But then they'll be on porn [[01:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vmIoMMRdKE&t=3788.7599999999998s)]
*  Now i'm not pointing at these people saying they're i'm any different [[01:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vmIoMMRdKE&t=3791.4s)]
*  I'm just saying it's interesting [[01:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vmIoMMRdKE&t=3794.68s)]

*  But I just can't stop thinking about her and can't [[01:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vmIoMMRdKE&t=4555.820000000001s)]
*  Can't focus anymore, man. I'm just [[01:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vmIoMMRdKE&t=4559.66s)]
*  I'm feeling very lost, you know, i'm only 22 and I don't know what to do [[01:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vmIoMMRdKE&t=4562.860000000001s)]
*  I hope you hear this man. I know you get a lot of calls and [[01:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vmIoMMRdKE&t=4566.78s)]
*  Gang brother. I appreciate it man. Thanks for the call and i'm sorry that you're uh, going through this moment. Um [[01:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vmIoMMRdKE&t=4572.38s)]
*  Yeah, that's that's tough because then you got two addictions really um [[01:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vmIoMMRdKE&t=4580.78s)]
*  And it sounds like the addiction really [[01:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vmIoMMRdKE&t=4586.7s)]
*  I'm no bro. I'm no scientist. You know it i'm no, uh [[01:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vmIoMMRdKE&t=4590.46s)]
*  Medicine man or therapist [[01:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vmIoMMRdKE&t=4595.34s)]
*  But a lot of times I thought I had a drug problem [[01:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vmIoMMRdKE&t=4599.66s)]
*  But a lot of my drug use was [[01:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vmIoMMRdKE&t=4604.3s)]
*  instigated by interactions with women [[01:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vmIoMMRdKE&t=4607.400000000001s)]
*  Right, so a certain thing would happen with a woman I would feel some rejection or I'd feel some type of way or I [[01:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vmIoMMRdKE&t=4611.9800000000005s)]
*  Couldn't communicate [[01:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vmIoMMRdKE&t=4617.66s)]
*  And then I would do do using drugs [[01:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vmIoMMRdKE&t=4619.34s)]
*  So my real really had kind of two addictions I had an addiction to to to [[01:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vmIoMMRdKE&t=4622.620000000001s)]
*  I had an addiction to a relationship staying in a certain space and if it got out of that space [[01:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vmIoMMRdKE&t=4629.34s)]
*  I couldn't hang I was I was off the rails [[01:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vmIoMMRdKE&t=4633.740000000001s)]
*  And then to help myself. I would use a drug [[01:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vmIoMMRdKE&t=4637.26s)]
*  You know to help put some control [[01:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vmIoMMRdKE&t=4640.9400000000005s)]
*  Because some things about drugs some drugs it's like I just want to control how I feel right now [[01:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vmIoMMRdKE&t=4645.1s)]
*  How I feel right now [[01:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vmIoMMRdKE&t=4649.179999999999s)]
*  That's it's about control talking about someone being fucked. Yeah, it's like [[01:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vmIoMMRdKE&t=4652.139999999999s)]
*  The byproduct of that, but I want to control how I feel right this instant. It's about control [[01:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vmIoMMRdKE&t=4656.46s)]
*  That's why I didn't love drink I like cocaine bitch I want to fuck I'm gonna fucking [[01:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vmIoMMRdKE&t=4663.339999999999s)]
*  That's what I'll you know [[01:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vmIoMMRdKE&t=4675.9s)]
*  um [[01:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vmIoMMRdKE&t=4678.379999999999s)]
*  Anyway, I don't know if i'm I don't know if i'm being of any service here. Let me listen more time [[01:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vmIoMMRdKE&t=4679.98s)]
*  That's right. So I know she did that another man was touching her [[01:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vmIoMMRdKE&t=4683.179999999999s)]
*  I don't know. I just [[01:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vmIoMMRdKE&t=4687.98s)]
*  Lost it man, and I don't know what to do [[01:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vmIoMMRdKE&t=4689.9s)]
*  I've taken two weeks off of work right now and i'm trying to get back on my feet, but I just can't stop thinking about her and can't [[01:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vmIoMMRdKE&t=4694.219999999999s)]
*  Can't focus anymore, man. I'm right. So right there you're saying I can't stop thinking about her [[01:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vmIoMMRdKE&t=4701.9s)]
*  So that's really the impetus of the issue [[01:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vmIoMMRdKE&t=4707.02s)]
*  you know, um [[01:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vmIoMMRdKE&t=4710.86s)]
*  Man, I think there's there's you know, there's there's groups [[01:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vmIoMMRdKE&t=4714.3s)]
*  Called sex and love addiction intimacy addiction that kind of thing you may [[01:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vmIoMMRdKE&t=4717.5s)]
*  reap something from it [[01:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vmIoMMRdKE&t=4723.82s)]
*  you know, it's people that [[01:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vmIoMMRdKE&t=4725.42s)]
*  you know, they call it sex and love addiction, but a lot of times it's just [[01:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vmIoMMRdKE&t=4727.900000000001s)]
*  you know, I remember if a woman broke up with me or [[01:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vmIoMMRdKE&t=4731.66s)]
*  Treated me some type of way. I I mean I couldn't fucking breathe brother [[01:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vmIoMMRdKE&t=4735.74s)]
*  It shook me [[01:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vmIoMMRdKE&t=4741.259999999999s)]
*  Because the only way I valued myself was if I had some if there was a value from a woman [[01:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vmIoMMRdKE&t=4743.5s)]
*  That's the only way that I valued myself [[01:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vmIoMMRdKE&t=4747.98s)]
*  In the second that got uncertain or they weren't they didn't value me or they valued somebody else. Oh gosh, brother [[01:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vmIoMMRdKE&t=4752.54s)]
*  I was [[01:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vmIoMMRdKE&t=4761.34s)]
*  I didn't have a chance man. I didn't have a chance because I I didn't have anything else that was holding me up [[01:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vmIoMMRdKE&t=4763.34s)]
*  The only thing was holding me up was how you what you felt about me or if you thought I was if you thought I was [[01:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vmIoMMRdKE&t=4770.54s)]
*  Okay, that's the only thing that was that that was my legs [[01:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vmIoMMRdKE&t=4775.1s)]
*  And once that was gone [[01:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vmIoMMRdKE&t=4779.66s)]
*  man [[01:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vmIoMMRdKE&t=4781.82s)]

*  You know, but I can really relate to that man. I'm sorry that you're dealing with that [[01:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vmIoMMRdKE&t=4788.62s)]

*  And listen for the similarities not the differences that's what people say when you go into those rooms [[01:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vmIoMMRdKE&t=4807.58s)]
