*  God never divvied him up at birth and so he's doubled up in there [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=378.7s)]
*  And other people said it's just an echo, you know, he gots a big he gots a wide throat. So [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=384.21999999999997s)]
*  When he says something one time then you just hear it another time here at another time [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=389.65999999999997s)]
*  So there's all these different rumors and speculations, you know [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=395.3s)]
*  But I you know when I see Gerald he would just say, you know, he would say something to you and then he would say something to you [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=399.94s)]

*  Syllables and consonants in every word, you know, God was just double dribbling on it [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=422.06s)]
*  And the first time I ever went anywhere I remember his mom his mom was uh [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=428.73999999999995s)]

*  Like speaking out against types of oppression [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=1877.9s)]

*  first of all [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=1906.62s)]
*  I think you should be you should have to get first place to to talk about the oppression and [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=1907.26s)]
*  Also, if you're in America, there's no there's not oppression. I [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=1912.2199999999998s)]
*  Don't feel like there's oppression, you know, I've met people from every race and every gender and [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=1917.1s)]

*  You know, so when a lot of these people are just talking about oppression [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=1942.78s)]
*  But they're literally standing in a place where they able to say whatever they want and can still go back to their own country [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=1947.1s)]
*  I think it's a perfect example of seeing her [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=1953.98s)]
*  This is a real example of what like oppression and control [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=1959.66s)]

*  When you're living in an amazing life, it's really hard to [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=1985.5s)]
*  To say that the place you're living it in the platform you're living it in is oppressing you I [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=1990.62s)]
*  Mean, I think we all feel somewhat [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=1996.94s)]
*  pressured and struggle through society [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=2000.1399999999999s)]

*  For everyone there needs to be some pressure [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=2009.3s)]
*  But yeah, I this is this is something that is real when now you can't even go back home [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=2014.7s)]
*  Because you spoke freely I [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=2024.14s)]
*  Bet if that was the case for some of the American athletes, I bet that they [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=2027.14s)]
*  Would have a different a understanding of oppression and then be a different tone [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=2034.3s)]

*  You know like being straight is definitely feels like it's [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=2229.76s)]
*  Like it is frowned upon or it is it's not right I [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=2238.76s)]
*  Agree in all in some of the sense that a lot of times they want to create a lot of uncertainty and kids and that's who [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=2248.6800000000003s)]
*  Consumes a lot of stuff and who really believes a lot of things that they see through media [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=2254.66s)]
*  You know, you got eight-year-old children now saying that they're they may be gay or [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=2260.34s)]
*  Or they are gay and you're like, well [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=2265.7400000000002s)]
*  You might be but I wouldn't it might be a little early to call the horse race [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=2268.42s)]
*  And it's wild man the media is wild on all fronts [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=2274.46s)]
*  You know, I think anyway the media has just gotten out of control [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=2278.58s)]
*  I think the media has created a lot of problems with the kovat thing a lot of you know [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=2282.22s)]
*  Nobody knows if they can trust a news source anymore [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=2287.42s)]
*  And I believe it's just because you can't [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=2292.38s)]
*  The news wins if we're all fighting if we're all sitting there in fear of kovat watching the news [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=2296.2999999999997s)]
*  To get the next dose of whatever they want to say then that's how they're going to be able to do it [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=2302.98s)]
*  And if they're not going to say then that's how they win [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=2307.58s)]
*  Especially now when there's like different news channels and some of them don't even feel a mayor like feels like [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=2312.86s)]
*  some of them just I [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=2320.54s)]
*  Don't know like they just look so down upon America where it which is the country you're allowed to even have the freedom of [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=2322.62s)]
*  Speech in it. It's all kind of baffling to me. Am I losing you here Riley? No, I'm here [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=2329.1s)]
*  What do you think on some of this do you think sometimes the media kind of or that like a lot of stuff is [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=2334.38s)]
*  Anti-straight or do you think there's any of that going on? What do you what? [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=2342.5s)]

*  And I don't either I think I just get fearful when I see people who do sometimes you know [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=2356.7000000000003s)]
*  That's almost real scary to me is meeting somebody who believes the news but then also [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=2362.34s)]
*  If you don't have the news all you have is that inner news your instincts [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=2369.14s)]
*  And and they're not really letting people live by those anymore [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=2374.42s)]
*  It feels like it's getting real dicey out there, but I applaud a little Boosie for speaking his mind [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=2381.02s)]

*  You know what I'm saying? That's not your job is to be ghosting [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=2429.38s)]
*  So it's just getting different out there it's getting a little dicey out there [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=2435.34s)]
*  So it's just getting different out there it's getting a little dicey out there [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=2438.7s)]
*  Let's get to a little more news and then we'll get to [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=2443.06s)]
*  Get to what else is going on the Wuhan lab, you know, that's coming out that they say that they've you know a [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=2448.1s)]
*  A [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=2456.5s)]
*  Federal committee has determined that there's a lot of evidence that believes [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=2457.78s)]
*  The mainstream media was silent on alarming findings from the House Foreign Affairs Committee [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=2463.3s)]
*  A probe into the possible ordinances of kovat 19 on Monday despite one lawmaker calling it the greatest cover-up in human history [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=2468.66s)]
*  Look a lot of people have thought that this where the disease came from [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=2476.46s)]
*  So I don't think I think this is just an example of [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=2481.62s)]
*  The news puts out what it wants to put out [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=2486.82s)]
*  And so they're now shaping what you believe what you know, and that's what's scary [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=2489.94s)]
*  That's what's scary is that the media can shape what we what we know and [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=2496.14s)]
*  What we believe they always have I feel like there used to be a sense that you could trust them [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=2503.46s)]
*  But now there's not that sense [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=2508.2999999999997s)]
*  So, of course you're gonna have every [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=2510.46s)]
*  You're gonna have people believe in things you're gonna have people uncertain what to believe [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=2513.74s)]
*  You can have people trust in their instincts [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=2518.74s)]
*  That's kind of where I'm at, man [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=2522.54s)]
*  That's kind of where I'm at one other thing. I noticed the if you look at the Olympic medals the three leading countries are [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=2525.7s)]
*  China America and Russia [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=2534.7799999999997s)]
*  Which I think is just kind of fascinating because those kind of are kind of like the countries that have that keep getting like spit around as [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=2538.8199999999997s)]
*  Like at each other's throats kind of or [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=2548.02s)]
*  Influencing each other's policies or having an effect on each other's policies or terrifying each other or boycotting each other [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=2551.1s)]
*  So I just it's almost like [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=2559.42s)]
*  It's just it makes it's like if there's some sort of bigger power some new world order that's moving things around [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=2565.1s)]
*  then [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=2572.7400000000002s)]
*  It makes sense that now in the Olympics [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=2574.06s)]
*  these are the three countries that are [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=2577.14s)]
*  The medal leaders that are kind of against each other. It's almost like it's just building the plot more and more [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=2580.46s)]
*  You know just the accusation of Russia infecting American politics and [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=2588.7s)]
*  The issues with the the virus coming from China and the denial of it [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=2594.26s)]
*  by [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=2600.14s)]
*  by [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=2601.7400000000002s)]
*  Some American media and American politics [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=2604.42s)]
*  It's just interesting that these are the three that are in the Olympics and it's neck and neck and I [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=2606.82s)]
*  Don't know [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=2612.5800000000004s)]
*  You know get a Glock and a little bit of property. I think if you can I feel like because it seems like it's spooky sometimes [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=2613.7000000000003s)]
*  like you don't know when they're gonna turn this the switch up even higher and [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=2621.3s)]
*  The grill under all of our feet is gonna get a little bit gonna get a little bit wicked [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=2626.34s)]

*  across the street at the neighbor's pool [[00:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=3508.64s)]
*  and I would just sit there and sit there and sit there. [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=3512.6s)]
*  And finally, the mother caught on to what was going on. [[00:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=3517.04s)]
*  And they never let me back over there again. [[00:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=3521.1600000000003s)]

*  but she definitely knew what was going on. [[00:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=3529.32s)]
*  So that was the first time that that ever happened. [[00:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=3531.18s)]
*  So that's just my story. [[00:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=3534.7s)]
*  All right, man, love you guys. [[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=3538.14s)]
*  Gang gang, buzz buzz. [[00:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=3539.54s)]
*  Gang gang, baby, love you too, man. [[00:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=3542.14s)]
*  And I wanna say this, I would love it be easily [[00:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=3543.92s)]
*  if maybe we could even get that woman's number [[00:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=3545.98s)]
*  and see if you could give her a call [[00:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=3547.94s)]
*  and just clear the air. [[00:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=3549.3399999999997s)]
*  I feel like sometimes there needs to be some air cleared. [[00:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=3554.7s)]
*  I got a man saw me masturbating myself [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=3556.94s)]
*  in a little pool house in Atlanta one time when I was young [[00:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=3561.92s)]
*  and I'll never forget that man [[00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=3567.04s)]
*  and really what his face looked like real quickly [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=3570.52s)]
*  as he opened the door and saw me [[00:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=3573.12s)]
*  and then closed it back up. [[00:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=3574.68s)]
*  That still hurts my heart a little bit. [[00:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=3577.08s)]
*  If I'd love to see him, if I had time to search, [[00:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=3578.36s)]
*  show people a picture of this man until we found him. [[00:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=3582.5s)]
*  But yeah, if you can get that lady's number, man, [[00:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=3585.7000000000003s)]
*  we'd love to get her and you on the line together [[00:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=3587.1600000000003s)]
*  and see if you can't just bring all that to a close, brother. [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=3588.92s)]
*  Because I'm sure part of you still feels bad [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=3592.32s)]
*  masturbating into their pool [[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=3596.0s)]
*  and then never seeing each other again. [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=3600.8s)]
*  That's dicey, dude. [[01:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=3604.0s)]
*  That's almost deadbeat dad kind of shit. [[01:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=3605.96s)]
*  Let's hear more, brother. [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=3608.88s)]
*  Here's another one that came in. [[01:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=3609.8s)]
*  Thank you, Beasley. [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=3610.92s)]
*  What do you think about what Beasley had to say there, [[01:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=3612.48s)]
*  Riley? [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=3614.08s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I think he feels a little bad. [[01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=3615.2799999999997s)]
*  I can just hear it in his voice. [[01:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=3621.56s)]
*  Thank you, I can too, actually. [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=3623.3199999999997s)]
*  I like that about you, man. [[01:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=3625.7599999999998s)]
*  You alert, you're right on the cusp, baby. [[01:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=3626.84s)]
*  Hey, Theo. [[01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=3632.0s)]
*  I just wanted to share with you a story [[01:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=3635.0s)]
*  about the first time that I ever experimented [[01:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=3636.52s)]
*  with getting that old semen out of me. [[01:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=3640.84s)]
*  Ejaculation, brother. [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=3643.72s)]
*  Yes, sir. [[01:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=3645.3199999999997s)]
*  Tell me more. [[01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=3646.3199999999997s)]
*  You know what, I do agree with you. [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=3648.16s)]
*  That should be on the periodic table of elements. [[01:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=3649.3599999999997s)]
*  Well, I was home alone and I was exploring. [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=3653.8799999999997s)]
*  It was around Christmas time. [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=3656.96s)]
*  I was looking in the closet, [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=3658.12s)]
*  in my parents' closet, [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=3660.48s)]
*  looking for some Christmas presents, [[01:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=3661.52s)]
*  maybe some wrapping paper just to get a clue [[01:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=3663.3999999999996s)]
*  and see this little bottle. [[01:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=3665.3999999999996s)]
*  And it said something about hot and cold on it. [[01:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=3668.08s)]
*  And I squeezed some in my hand [[01:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=3672.08s)]
*  and it smelled good and it was slippery. [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=3674.52s)]
*  And I said, you know what, I'm gonna go out in the driveway [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=3676.12s)]
*  and sit in that old batter [[01:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=3678.68s)]
*  that's been sitting there for about three years. [[01:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=3679.7999999999997s)]
*  So started rubbing on myself [[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=3682.6s)]
*  and something came out of me. [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=3686.88s)]
*  And I was probably about 13 years old [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=3690.04s)]
*  and it felt good. [[01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=3692.4s)]
*  I did feel ashamed though [[01:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=3694.96s)]
*  because I knew I wasn't supposed to be doing that. [[01:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=3696.6s)]
*  But I didn't know that was gonna happen. [[01:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=3699.2s)]
*  It just felt good, so I did. [[01:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=3701.0s)]
*  And you know, I got that hitter. [[01:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=3702.24s)]
*  As you told me to, I got that hitter. [[01:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=3705.64s)]
*  Gang, baby, yeah. [[01:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=3707.7599999999998s)]
*  The fellow right there found a little special lotion [[01:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=3709.8399999999997s)]
*  in his folks' room and he's out there [[01:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=3711.7999999999997s)]
*  pleasuring himself in a Saturn, [[01:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=3713.2799999999997s)]
*  doing hand pleasure in a Saturn. [[01:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=3714.64s)]
*  And I'm sure a lot of people have coomed out in a Saturn [[01:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=3718.3599999999997s)]
*  before, I'm not shocked by that [[01:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=3720.7599999999998s)]
*  because they even had to discontinue them at some point. [[01:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=3722.04s)]
*  What about school dances and stuff, Riley? [[01:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=3730.08s)]
*  When you went to that sort of thing, [[01:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=3731.92s)]
*  was there any pressure to be sexually active [[01:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=3732.92s)]
*  or creative in those environments? [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=3736.2000000000003s)]
*  I'm not really. [[01:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=3737.76s)]
*  Then again, I only went to a couple of school dances. [[01:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=3738.6s)]
*  Was it any with an actual girlfriend [[01:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=3741.36s)]
*  or was it more like a set-up date? [[01:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=3743.0s)]
*  Neither, it was just with friends. [[01:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=3745.08s)]
*  Oh really, just with the amigo stag, huh? [[01:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=3746.48s)]
*  Man, we gotta get you out there. [[01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=3749.12s)]
*  All right, let's hear another one that came in right here. [[01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=3753.32s)]
*  Thank you guys for these calls [[01:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=3755.44s)]
*  and for sharing this part of your life. [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=3756.76s)]
*  I know it's a unique time in a man's life. [[01:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=3758.6s)]
*  You know, when you really, [[01:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=3761.8s)]
*  when you just start making those orphans. [[01:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=3763.7200000000003s)]
*  Let's hear it. [[01:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=3765.44s)]
*  Hey Theo, it's Ridge, man. [[01:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=3767.84s)]
*  I'm calling, listening to your latest episode [[01:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=3769.4s)]
*  and you're talking about wanting stories [[01:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=3773.0s)]
*  about the first time you spilled the dumplings. [[01:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=3775.52s)]
*  Amen, Ridge. [[01:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=3778.7200000000003s)]
*  Thank you for calling, Ridge, amen. [[01:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=3779.56s)]
*  My first time diddling in the Lord's middle, man, [[01:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=3783.12s)]
*  and it was in the bathtub. [[01:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=3785.32s)]
*  And I was laying in there. [[01:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=3787.8s)]
*  I'd take long baths. [[01:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=3789.16s)]
*  I was about 12 years old. [[01:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=3790.36s)]
*  Oh yeah, as a pervert, baby, onward. [[01:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=3791.88s)]
*  My little sister, you know, [[01:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=3794.28s)]
*  we only had two kids in our house. [[01:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=3796.1200000000003s)]
*  So it was none of that, but she had some Barbies. [[01:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=3797.92s)]
*  And she had the Barbies laying out [[01:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=3801.32s)]
*  and they had this smooth pelvis region. [[01:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=3804.32s)]
*  But you know, my imagination got the best of me. [[01:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=3807.04s)]
*  And I spilled the dumplings. [[01:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=3809.2400000000002s)]
*  And then from there on out, it was every night. [[01:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=3811.88s)]
*  I was thinking about the neighbors, black sisters. [[01:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=3815.92s)]
*  And I felt guilty about that. [[01:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=3818.48s)]
*  But I've gotten past it. [[01:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=3821.04s)]
*  But yeah, it was the Barbies in the bathtub, man. [[01:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=3822.2799999999997s)]
*  All right, gang, gang. [[01:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=3825.04s)]
*  Gang, baby, yeah. [[01:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=3826.64s)]
*  I mean, look, that's one thing too. [[01:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=3827.52s)]
*  It can promote diversity. [[01:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=3830.2799999999997s)]
*  One thing that's neat about jerking off [[01:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=3831.68s)]
*  or jerking yourself or spilling your body [[01:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=3834.0s)]
*  outside of yourself is that you can fantasize about anyone. [[01:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=3837.64s)]
*  And so it can create a lot of diversity in your brain. [[01:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=3845.6s)]
*  You know, you can really, [[01:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=3849.7200000000003s)]
*  I mean, you could really pleasure yourself [[01:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=3851.88s)]
*  to someone from the 1800s, 1600s. [[01:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=3853.7200000000003s)]
*  You know, you could pleasure yourself [[01:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=3857.0800000000004s)]
*  to someone from damn, you know, 1960s, whatever you want. [[01:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=3859.1600000000003s)]
*  They could be black, they could be Viet, Chinese, white, [[01:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=3864.5200000000004s)]
*  Asian, German, you know, they could be anything, bro. [[01:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=3869.1200000000003s)]
*  So there you go. [[01:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=3874.84s)]
*  All right, let's hear one or two more that came in. [[01:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=3876.68s)]
*  Onward. [[01:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=3879.0s)]
*  See, yo, the first time I, [[01:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=3881.88s)]
*  this is David from Baltimore calling. [[01:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=3883.52s)]
*  The first time I pleasured myself, [[01:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=3885.0s)]
*  I actually didn't do it with my hands. [[01:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=3887.12s)]
*  This is a little weird, [[01:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=3889.2400000000002s)]
*  but there was a hole in the back of this teddy bear. [[01:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=3890.28s)]
*  Sure, there just happened to be one, huh? [[01:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=3893.4s)]
*  That old trick. [[01:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=3897.64s)]
*  That I had, when I was a kid, [[01:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=3899.36s)]
*  there was a hole in the back of it, [[01:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=3901.28s)]
*  and I kind of, you know, pressed inside it and kept going. [[01:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=3903.64s)]
*  And then when suddenly I got to the point that I ejaculated, [[01:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=3907.96s)]
*  I definitely was scared. [[01:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=3913.56s)]
*  I didn't know, I grew up in a very Christian family. [[01:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=3914.6s)]
*  No one ever, you know, explained to me [[01:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=3916.72s)]
*  what semen was, really. [[01:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=3918.3599999999997s)]
*  And so I really was scared that maybe I had hurt myself [[01:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=3920.3199999999997s)]
*  because it was the first fluid to come out of my body, [[01:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=3924.24s)]
*  besides urine or feces or blood, [[01:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=3927.44s)]
*  that just really kind of caught me off guard. [[01:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=3931.2400000000002s)]
*  Yeah, baby, that trick shot, you know? [[01:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=3933.84s)]
*  That fourth fluid, baby, more? [[01:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=3937.76s)]
*  And I definitely was nervous. [[01:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=3939.92s)]
*  Yeah, I love you, man. [[01:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=3943.52s)]
*  Love you too, brother, and yeah. [[01:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=3944.92s)]
*  Oh, what do you think when you hear these guys, [[01:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=3947.92s)]
*  or do you think it's okay? [[01:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=3949.76s)]
*  Do you think they're wrong, [[01:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=3950.96s)]
*  or do you feel like it's just what they're doing? [[01:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=3952.08s)]
*  What's going on? [[01:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=3953.96s)]
*  I mean, like I said, it's what they do. [[01:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=3956.48s)]
*  If they wanna do it, they wanna do it. [[01:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=3961.1200000000003s)]
*  Yep. [[01:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=3962.1600000000003s)]
*  Can't stop them. [[01:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=3963.0s)]
*  Yep, wish we could sometimes. [[01:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=3963.84s)]
*  Let's hear one more that came in here. [[01:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=3965.52s)]
*  Here we go. [[01:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=3967.2400000000002s)]
*  Hey, Phil, it's Xander from Indiana. [[01:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=3968.88s)]
*  Xander, thank you for calling. [[01:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=3972.96s)]
*  And Xander definitely sounds like somebody [[01:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=3975.0s)]
*  that's willing to jack themselves out a little, [[01:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=3976.52s)]
*  you know, get all ejacked up. [[01:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=3980.6400000000003s)]
*  Let's hear more, bubby. [[01:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=3982.32s)]
*  I was giving you a call, I was listening to the podcast, [[01:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=3983.8s)]
*  and you said you wanna hear [[01:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=3985.8s)]
*  about that first-time ejac story. [[01:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=3986.6400000000003s)]
*  Anyway, I was in the eighth grade, [[01:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=3988.72s)]
*  so it must've been about 12, 13. [[01:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=3991.56s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[01:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=3993.52s)]
*  And I went on a ski trip for the class trip, [[01:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=3994.56s)]
*  and I went off a big jump, and I landed on my back, [[01:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=3996.8399999999997s)]
*  and I messed it up, but when I got home, [[01:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=4000.2799999999997s)]
*  my mom was telling me to ice it and whatnot, [[01:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=4003.24s)]
*  and she brought out the back massager. [[01:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=4006.6s)]
*  You know, I was in my bedroom with that back massager, [[01:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=4010.12s)]
*  and you know, I put it on my penis. [[01:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=4012.6s)]
*  And a few seconds later, you know, [[01:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=4015.8799999999997s)]
*  I creamed out, brother. [[01:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=4017.84s)]
*  Did that ignition. [[01:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=4021.44s)]
*  Anyway, I didn't know what happened, [[01:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=4022.88s)]
*  so I went to my older brother, [[01:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=4025.56s)]
*  who was about two years older than me, [[01:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=4026.84s)]
*  and I showed him. [[01:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=4028.28s)]
*  I was like, dude, what is this? [[01:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=4029.1200000000003s)]
*  This came out of me. [[01:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=4030.36s)]
*  He looked at me, he goes, throw those in the garbage, [[01:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=4031.6800000000003s)]
*  and don't ever tell anyone that you did that again. [[01:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=4034.44s)]
*  So I was scared. [[01:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=4038.1200000000003s)]
*  I was like, man, what was that? [[01:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=4039.1600000000003s)]
*  Anyway, I spent the next couple months [[01:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=4041.6400000000003s)]
*  scared to death to lose any, [[01:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=4044.32s)]
*  and I thought that if I did it too much, [[01:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=4046.36s)]
*  that I would run out. [[01:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=4049.1200000000003s)]
*  And I didn't figure out that your body [[01:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=4050.84s)]
*  just keeps pumping that shit out [[01:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=4052.84s)]
*  until I was about 16, 17. [[01:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=4054.36s)]
*  So I'm that private school late learner, bro. [[01:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=4059.7200000000003s)]
*  Anyway, have a blessed rest of your week. [[01:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=4064.96s)]
*  Gang, gang, baby. [[01:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=4067.52s)]
*  Gang, baby, huh. [[01:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=4069.2000000000003s)]
*  That he would run out, that's interesting, huh? [[01:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=4071.48s)]
*  That he would run out, that there wouldn't be more. [[01:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=4074.88s)]
*  His brother said, don't tell anybody, go hide it. [[01:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=4077.92s)]
*  The other kids making love to a bear. [[01:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=4081.44s)]
*  I mean, this is why we are the society we are, I think. [[01:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=4083.32s)]
*  This is why we don't know, no one knows. [[01:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=4087.36s)]
*  There's no education. [[01:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=4090.7200000000003s)]
*  People are making love to hold out bears. [[01:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=4092.32s)]
*  People are screwing pool jets. [[01:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=4096.2s)]
*  You know, there's just, for all the information we have, [[01:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=4098.98s)]
*  the fact that we don't share it to one another [[01:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=4105.5s)]
*  blows my damn nuts out. [[01:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=4109.46s)]
*  Oh, well that's some of them right there, man. [[01:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=4114.34s)]
*  I remember, I'll share a few with you, Riley, [[01:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=4117.98s)]
*  a couple of my own experiences. [[01:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=4120.86s)]
*  You know, I remember I was in love with this gal, [[01:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=4123.7s)]
*  and she was pretty good looking. [[01:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=4126.219999999999s)]
*  You know, she was probably six out of 10, [[01:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=4130.219999999999s)]
*  which was good for me. [[01:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=4132.62s)]
*  You know, it was good for me. [[01:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=4134.339999999999s)]
*  She was a real little thicky bear. [[01:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=4135.78s)]
*  And she had real soft titty, I remember that. [[01:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=4139.099999999999s)]
*  And I was over at their house one time, [[01:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=4145.139999999999s)]
*  and we were sitting back by this river. [[01:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=4147.259999999999s)]
*  They had like a river out back, or like a creek or something. [[01:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=4149.7s)]
*  And she J-O'd me out into the stream. [[01:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=4153.7s)]
*  You know, she gave me a handy, or whatever they call it. [[01:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=4156.38s)]
*  You know, just a wrist, just wristing me out [[01:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=4159.5s)]
*  into this little stream. [[01:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=4161.46s)]
*  And I didn't know I'd never, like, [[01:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=4162.78s)]
*  I'd never just, you know, pervade semen out of my body [[01:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=4169.78s)]
*  near anybody else. [[01:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=4172.94s)]
*  No one had ever else had seen me do this kind of magic, [[01:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=4176.58s)]
*  this body magic. [[01:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=4179.0599999999995s)]
*  And so next thing you know, I eject out into the stream, [[01:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=4181.3s)]
*  and these fish swim up, [[01:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=4185.38s)]
*  and literally just start consuming it. [[01:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=4188.9400000000005s)]
*  And so I'm like having dreams [[01:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=4192.820000000001s)]
*  that I'm gonna have like fish that look like me [[01:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=4196.5s)]
*  in our area. [[01:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=4201.06s)]
*  You know, so I was always embarrassed [[01:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=4203.54s)]
*  to go fishing after that, [[01:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=4205.06s)]
*  because I think I always felt like somehow they would know, [[01:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=4206.3s)]
*  like somebody would pull a fish out of the water [[01:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=4209.58s)]
*  and they would hear it, you know, like, [[01:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=4211.3s)]
*  then the idea would come into their head, [[01:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=4213.3s)]
*  because the truth would be in the fish. [[01:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=4214.86s)]
*  So shit like that can really mess a child up, dude. [[01:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=4218.5s)]
*  You know, it can really, [[01:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=4221.98s)]
*  it can really mess a child up, but. [[01:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=4225.18s)]
*  Riley, what else, man? [[01:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=4229.18s)]
*  Anything else we wanna tell people or talk about? [[01:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=4231.58s)]
*  I got a free hot dog from Daddy's Dogs. [[01:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=4235.98s)]
*  Oh, you did? [[01:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=4238.74s)]
*  I did. [[01:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=4239.58s)]
*  Oh, wow, and how'd you get that? [[01:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=4240.42s)]
*  I was just walking around with a few friends, [[01:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=4244.62s)]
*  and someone who was working at the cart was like, [[01:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=4246.58s)]
*  Riley Mao, and I was like, hey man, what's up? [[01:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=4252.74s)]
*  He was like, dude, love you on the podcast. [[01:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=4255.34s)]
*  So he gave me a free hot dog. [[01:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=4257.139999999999s)]
*  Really? [[01:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=4258.179999999999s)]
*  Yeah, shout out to Daddy's Dogs. [[01:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=4259.0199999999995s)]
*  Damn, Daddy's Dogs hooking people up with, [[01:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=4260.62s)]
*  hooking Riley up with that nice treat. [[01:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=4263.7s)]
*  Was it a good dog? [[01:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=4265.26s)]
*  It was. [[01:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=4266.219999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I love a good dog, man. [[01:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=4267.34s)]
*  I love him. [[01:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSBvlTsqhk&t=4270.860000000001s)]
