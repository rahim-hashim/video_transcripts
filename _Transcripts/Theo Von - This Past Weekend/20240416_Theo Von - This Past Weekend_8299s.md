*  Tim Fletcher, thanks for joining me, man. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=58.56s)]
*  My pleasure. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=82.4s)]
*  I've seen a lot of your videos on YouTube and a lot of it really resonates with me about [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=83.44s)]
*  trauma, childhood trauma, just a lot of things in that vein. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=90.72s)]
*  I mean, you have so many wonderful videos out there. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=96.96s)]
*  And I'm just thankful you're here today to talk with us about it. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=99.75999999999999s)]
*  I know we want to talk about trauma today and that sort of thing, but it's also like a buzzword. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=104.64s)]
*  I feel like people use a lot and I don't want this to be like a thing where we're just creating [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=108.88s)]
*  victims or you know what I'm saying? [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=115.67999999999999s)]
*  Kind of. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=116.96s)]
*  Yep. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=117.36s)]
*  Yep. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=118.64s)]
*  I think lots in the last 10 years is traumas kind of come on the radar. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=119.03999999999999s)]
*  Now everybody's talking about everybody's trauma informed and yet people really don't [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=123.6s)]
*  understand it a whole lot. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=128.56s)]
*  But a lot of the response has been, no, I got somebody to blame. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=129.92s)]
*  Right. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=134.88s)]
*  And it's like, no, we can explain now a lot of your behavior, but you got to now take [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=135.36s)]
*  responsibility to change that. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=140.8s)]
*  Yeah, that's what, yeah. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=143.44000000000003s)]
*  And I don't want to create a lot of victims today. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=144.32000000000002s)]
*  Like that's another part. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=146.24s)]
*  And this isn't a judgment against anybody. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=147.76000000000002s)]
*  I'm just, this is even for myself. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=149.84s)]
*  I've had a lot of problems. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=151.52s)]
*  I'll get trapped in self-pity sometimes. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=152.4s)]
*  So I just, but like you're saying, this is a great place for information. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=154.48000000000002s)]
*  And how do we go about like not creating victims? [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=159.20000000000002s)]
*  Right. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=163.36s)]
*  So to me, what trauma is, is pain happens to every child, but a child in a healthy home [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=164.08s)]
*  is able to get tools and support and they can resolve and grow through that. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=171.76000000000002s)]
*  So it's not trauma. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=176.48000000000002s)]
*  It's pain that gets turned into growth. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=177.44s)]
*  But what happens to a child that can't resolve it? [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=180.08s)]
*  Nobody's supporting them. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=182.4s)]
*  Nobody's giving them tools to handle it. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=183.44s)]
*  It turns into trauma. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=186.16000000000003s)]
*  They're a victim. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=187.76000000000002s)]
*  They're legitimate victim, a helpless victim who can't fix the problem. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=188.88s)]
*  And so they are legitimate victims. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=195.84s)]
*  The problem is, is that they still feel like a victim as an adult, even though they're [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=198.24s)]
*  not a victim now, they now have tools and support. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=202.64s)]
*  And that's one of the hardest transitions is to move from, I was a legitimate victim, [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=205.84s)]
*  but now I got to take responsibility because I can. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=212.07999999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=214.72s)]
*  And some don't want to do that because they like staying a victim. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=215.44s)]
*  Cause then I don't have to be responsible. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=219.04s)]
*  People feel so sorry for me. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=220.88s)]
*  I can blame somebody. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=222.56s)]
*  I don't have to grow up. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=224.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=226.16s)]
*  It's fascinating. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=226.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=227.52s)]
*  Let's talk about trauma. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=227.76s)]
*  Let's talk about complex trauma. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=228.72s)]
*  So what is it? [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=230.8s)]
*  How would we say what it is? [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=231.84s)]
*  So trauma is, is so the event happens on the outside, but I can't handle it. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=234.0s)]
*  It's too painful. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=240.88s)]
*  It's too scary for me. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=241.92s)]
*  So it creates this fear and stress that I don't have the tools to handle. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=243.76s)]
*  Okay. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=248.95999999999998s)]
*  And so as a result of that, since I can't fix it and resolve it, it then wounds me on [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=249.92s)]
*  the inside and that's the trauma is what takes place on the inside. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=255.35999999999999s)]
*  What makes why we call it complex trauma. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=259.84s)]
*  So it's really mathematical terms. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=262.48s)]
*  So there's simple math and there's complex math. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=265.28s)]
*  So simple is one number, complex is more than one. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=268.4s)]
*  So simple trauma is a one event trauma, a car accident, a rape, whatever complex [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=271.6s)]
*  is ongoing danger. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=278.16s)]
*  So a child's in a situation where they're in ongoing danger. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=280.08000000000004s)]
*  So there's, their stress system is constantly activated. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=284.0s)]
*  Like, do I fight flight? [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=287.44s)]
*  What do I do here? [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=289.12s)]
*  I got to get out of here. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=290.0s)]
*  I can't handle this. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=290.72s)]
*  I can't handle this. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=291.44s)]
*  So that when a child lives in that environment all the time where they're [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=292.72s)]
*  constantly activated to fight flight, but if they're too little to fight or flight, [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=297.6s)]
*  then they eventually go out. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=303.28000000000003s)]
*  I'm shutting her down. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=304.64000000000004s)]
*  Freeze. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=306.24s)]
*  I can't handle this. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=307.04s)]
*  So they go into this dissociative, let's go into an internal world to protect [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=308.32000000000005s)]
*  herself and create a fantasy world because it's safe there. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=313.20000000000005s)]
*  And so complex trauma is comes out of basically abuse or neglect. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=318.48s)]
*  So the two extreme ends of the spectrum. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=324.88s)]
*  So the abuse we can easily imagine that's physical abuse, emotional abuse, that's [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=327.28s)]
*  harsh environment, violence, et cetera. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=332.64s)]
*  But a lot of complex trauma comes out of neglect. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=336.47999999999996s)]
*  And that's the other end of the spectrum where all the physical needs of the child were met, [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=340.08s)]
*  but their emotional needs were met. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=345.84s)]
*  So the abuse trauma, something happens to you. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=347.76s)]
*  Neglect trauma, something didn't happen to you that should have happened. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=351.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=355.11999999999995s)]
*  And it's hard to find out those, the neglect trauma. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=355.76s)]
*  Sometimes it's hard to locate some of it because it's like almost feeling around for ghosts [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=357.76s)]
*  is what it feels like. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=362.24s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=362.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=363.68s)]
*  And so that's where we spend a lot of time. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=364.08s)]
*  So what we've done with it is that we've broken down kind of the emotional needs that [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=366.15999999999997s)]
*  a child has. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=370.88s)]
*  So we have a need to be a child needs to be authentic and to connect with safe people [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=371.44s)]
*  and really be able to be vulnerable and open up and to be totally accepted for who they are. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=376.56s)]
*  Have somebody who totally gets them and hears them and sees them and values them and nurtures [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=381.68s)]
*  them. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=389.12s)]
*  Those are all emotional needs. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=389.84000000000003s)]
*  But if a child grows up in a home or I'm too busy for you or smart enough, get over it, [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=392.0s)]
*  toughen up, nobody's getting them. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=397.04s)]
*  Nobody's hearing them or why can't you be like your brother, et cetera. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=399.44s)]
*  All of that is emotional trauma. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=402.96000000000004s)]
*  That's hurting the child emotionally. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=405.92s)]
*  So the child's not feeling safe to be them. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=408.0s)]
*  So the child then has to adapt in order to try to protect itself. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=411.76s)]
*  So I got to be tougher. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=416.24s)]
*  I can't be so sensitive. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=417.6s)]
*  I got to wear this mask of being outgoing, et cetera. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=419.6s)]
*  But that's also how I'm going to try to get my needs met. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=425.04s)]
*  So maybe if I'm different, then dad will give me more attention. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=427.28000000000003s)]
*  Then mom won't be so angry at me all the time. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=430.08s)]
*  So they're adapting, adapting, trying to get their needs met, trying to keep safe. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=434.0s)]
*  And they don't even know who they are a lot of times. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=438.24s)]
*  And that's what happens. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=439.92s)]
*  They don't even really develop. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=440.96s)]
*  They don't have a clue who they are after a while because they're so [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=442.47999999999996s)]
*  busy trying to be something they're not to get acceptance and love [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=446.0s)]
*  because they know if they're authentic. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=450.96s)]
*  So in a healthy situation of you're authentic, you connect in your love. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=453.35999999999996s)]
*  In complex trauma, if you're authentic, you get rejected. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=459.03999999999996s)]
*  And so then you'll, yeah, then you pull that authenticity back in, [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=462.88s)]
*  especially if you're really young, you don't even know. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=466.47999999999996s)]
*  You're still net learning so much about yourself for evolving. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=468.64s)]
*  Who even knows what happens to when you redirect that river. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=472.08s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=476.08s)]
*  That's supposed to be normal. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=476.48s)]
*  It just becomes a, it's just damn floods, everything. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=477.59999999999997s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=480.15999999999997s)]
*  It can get some real sewage going on. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=480.88s)]
*  So what happens when the child is neglected is the child basically [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=482.71999999999997s)]
*  thinks everything, it must be their fault. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=487.68s)]
*  So the reason dad's too busy must be because I'm not good enough. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=489.92s)]
*  Reason mom's angry is I'm not good enough. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=493.12s)]
*  I'm not good enough. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=495.20000000000005s)]
*  So they, they begin to develop this core self identity that something's wrong with me. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=495.76000000000005s)]
*  I'm not good enough. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=501.28000000000003s)]
*  So I have to change and be somebody else in order to get acceptance and love. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=502.96000000000004s)]
*  Why does a child develop? [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=507.12s)]
*  Why does a child, because the world revolves around them when they're a child, [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=508.24s)]
*  they only know themselves. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=513.28s)]
*  And so they have no one else to blame if something is wrong in the world. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=514.64s)]
*  Right. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=517.28s)]
*  So we refer to it. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=517.76s)]
*  So the child brain is basically what's developed as the limbic brain, [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=519.12s)]
*  which is the emotional center. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=523.28s)]
*  So the cortex hasn't developed yet. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=524.56s)]
*  And so it's called egocentric thinking. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=526.88s)]
*  So everything they see through their eyes, it affects them. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=528.9599999999999s)]
*  They caused it. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=532.64s)]
*  Everything is related to them somehow. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=533.92s)]
*  So if dad's too busy or mom and dad get a divorce, I must have done something wrong. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=537.52s)]
*  It must be my fault. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=541.52s)]
*  If I get sexually abused, I must have brought it on. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=543.28s)]
*  So everything is an egocentric way of thinking. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=546.72s)]
*  I see. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=550.0s)]
*  Cause they're really the only player on the court kind of. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=550.48s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=552.56s)]
*  And so then what happens though with that is they make adjustments, hoping to get love and acceptance [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=553.6s)]
*  and get their needs met and stay safe. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=560.16s)]
*  But something way back here now goes your phony. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=562.8s)]
*  So they get the imposter syndrome, which says you're getting love and acceptance. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=567.12s)]
*  But if they knew the real you, they wouldn't be giving you that love and acceptance [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=571.8399999999999s)]
*  because you're an imposter. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=576.8s)]
*  So the solution hasn't fixed the problem. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=578.0s)]
*  It's still unresolved. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=581.1999999999999s)]
*  So that's where complex trauma then it's still not fixed. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=582.56s)]
*  So I'm still in fight or flight. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=587.28s)]
*  So I got to come up with a new persona. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=589.52s)]
*  I got to come up with a new mechanism exactly to try and get my needs met, [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=591.3599999999999s)]
*  but I never can find a solution that totally satisfies. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=597.4399999999999s)]
*  So it's more than one trauma that happens to a child, right? [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=601.92s)]
*  And they don't have somebody there to help them process it. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=605.76s)]
*  Can children have different levels of trauma or no trauma if they have somebody there to [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=608.88s)]
*  help them process it? [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=614.0799999999999s)]
*  Right. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=615.4399999999999s)]
*  So there's degrees of trauma, some very severe to very mild. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=616.64s)]
*  And so the latest studies and Gabriela Mate in his book, The Myth of Normal, [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=621.52s)]
*  published them to say about 75% of Americans have this subtle complex trauma. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=630.3199999999999s)]
*  And basically it's a child that, so if a child is always being made [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=636.56s)]
*  teased by parents or ignored by parents, dad's always busy. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=643.36s)]
*  Dad's in this chair next to him, but he's always watching TV. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=646.96s)]
*  So he's physically there, but he's not there emotionally. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=650.72s)]
*  The child just doesn't feel loved and accepted. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=654.48s)]
*  So they don't feel safe. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=657.6s)]
*  They don't feel they can totally relax. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=659.4399999999999s)]
*  They have to somehow earn that connection, earn that love. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=662.7199999999999s)]
*  And so a child has this inner trauma taking place that's happening. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=666.88s)]
*  That's so subtle, but it's powerful and it's really major upheaval internally. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=672.64s)]
*  That's taking place inside the child. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=680.24s)]
*  It's forming how they're going to behave. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=682.0799999999999s)]
*  Oh, exactly. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=684.4799999999999s)]
*  So now they're going to start these behaviors to try to get attention, to try to get connection. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=685.28s)]
*  But is some of that natural too? [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=690.88s)]
*  Yeah, because a child and that's, it's built off very natural things. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=693.52s)]
*  So the child has a natural personality, so they can be like naturally funny, [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=697.0400000000001s)]
*  but then they can take that to just, I got to be funny all the time. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=700.96s)]
*  Every child wants to please and love, but now I'm going to be a hero. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=706.08s)]
*  I'm going to get straight A's. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=709.9200000000001s)]
*  I'm going to do all the chores. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=712.4s)]
*  I'm going to be a workaholic because that's how I'll get validation and acceptance. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=714.0s)]
*  Got it. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=719.9200000000001s)]
*  So you were just talking about, isn't some of that natural for a child? [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=720.72s)]
*  So that being wanting to help with the chores, that's a wonderful instinct that a child has, [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=726.24s)]
*  but now they're going to turn that into a maladaptation. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=733.2s)]
*  So now I'm going to be a people pleaser. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=736.24s)]
*  So I got to, or I'm going to be a perfectionist. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=738.48s)]
*  Everything's got to be perfect. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=740.72s)]
*  Are going to please never say no to anybody just, but then I'm going to burn myself out. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=741.84s)]
*  I'm never, and I'm going to kill myself. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=745.76s)]
*  So that adaptation. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=748.64s)]
*  You don't mean kill. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=750.08s)]
*  You just mean burn yourself out. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=750.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=751.68s)]
*  Okay. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=752.08s)]
*  That adaptation pleasing people and all of that has become a maladaptation. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=753.84s)]
*  It's now hurting me. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=759.6s)]
*  I see. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=760.72s)]
*  So a lot of children with complex trauma have maladaptations. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=761.04s)]
*  They all do. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=764.32s)]
*  They all do. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=764.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=765.44s)]
*  Okay. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=765.92s)]
*  And what are some symptoms of complex trauma that you can see in people? [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=766.64s)]
*  So very common ones is that they don't know who they are because they've had to wear masks [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=770.72s)]
*  all their life and they become people pleasers. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=777.2s)]
*  Most have anger issues. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=781.12s)]
*  Most have authority issues because all the authorities of their life have not been healthy. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=783.6800000000001s)]
*  Most have some control manipulation issues that are part of that. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=789.44s)]
*  A lot have lying issues. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=795.5200000000001s)]
*  They lie when it would just as be as just as easy to tell the truth, [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=797.6s)]
*  but lying is what they had to do to kind of stay safe. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=802.32s)]
*  Because truth got them in trouble. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=805.6s)]
*  There's a fear of failure, a fear of change, a fear even of success because it's like, [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=808.24s)]
*  oh, everything's going too good. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=815.2s)]
*  The other shoe is going to drop. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=817.6800000000001s)]
*  Something bad is going to happen. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=818.96s)]
*  So now I better sabotage it. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=820.88s)]
*  Wow. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=822.5600000000001s)]
*  So there's lots. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=823.6s)]
*  It's a fear driven thing. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=825.12s)]
*  The fear of rejection. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=827.0400000000001s)]
*  There's a desire for intimacy, but a fear of intimacy because then you're going to [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=828.72s)]
*  get to know me. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=834.4s)]
*  Then you're going to reject me. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=836.4s)]
*  Deep fear of abandonment that anybody that gets to know me leaves me. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=838.0s)]
*  And so that you can see all of that becomes problematic and relationship stuff and then [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=843.92s)]
*  trust issues. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=851.44s)]
*  Oh, God, Tim, you're a man. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=852.32s)]
*  A lot I can. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=855.6s)]
*  I can. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=858.16s)]
*  Yeah, I can relate to a lot of those things, you know, I can relate and I have to be careful [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=859.52s)]
*  when I think about because at certain points in my life, I've had a lot. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=863.44s)]
*  I've had those things and I have to be careful that I don't immediately attach it to being [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=867.0400000000001s)]
*  a victim. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=873.44s)]
*  Even when I'm thinking about it right now, I don't want to be like, okay, some of those [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=873.9200000000001s)]
*  things I've had in my life, man, what a piece of shit I am. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=877.84s)]
*  Right. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=881.5200000000001s)]
*  Because that's what will happen to us for me. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=882.08s)]
*  And if I can interrupt. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=885.44s)]
*  Yeah, no, please. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=887.2s)]
*  So what I would say is the core, the worst result that comes out of complex trauma is [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=888.24s)]
*  how it changes your self identity. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=894.32s)]
*  So a child that's loved and accepted is a positive self identity. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=897.92s)]
*  I have value. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=901.04s)]
*  I have something to offer to the world. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=901.76s)]
*  A child with complex trauma that's felt neglected, it's my fault, I must not be good enough. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=904.64s)]
*  They have a negative self identity. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=909.6800000000001s)]
*  And so because of that, I am a piece of shit. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=912.4s)]
*  Whoever would want to get to know me. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=916.0799999999999s)]
*  And so I need to hide who I really am. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=919.04s)]
*  So that core identity just affects every decision they make, every relationship response [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=921.8399999999999s)]
*  that they have. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=929.1999999999999s)]
*  And that's probably the most hidden part of complex trauma, the hardest thing for people [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=930.4799999999999s)]
*  to see because who understands shame? [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=936.9599999999999s)]
*  What's shame? [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=940.16s)]
*  What's that? [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=941.04s)]
*  But once you understand it, it's like, whoa, that changes everything. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=942.2399999999999s)]
*  And that's where the healing really has to take place. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=947.76s)]
*  Man, it's so funny you say some of this. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=952.4s)]
*  I like there'll be times where, yeah, like if a lot of times I'll take it to relationships. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=954.0s)]
*  If a girl rejected me or wouldn't look at me, man, it would attach itself to a place [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=963.1999999999999s)]
*  in me almost like a thought got into a Ferris wheel. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=971.52s)]
*  And I don't even know the Ferris wheel was going, but this thought got into the Ferris [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=977.4399999999999s)]
*  wheel, like a person getting into a little Ferris wheel compartment. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=980.64s)]
*  And the Ferris wheel was just like, you are just, you are horrible. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=986.0799999999999s)]
*  You are. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=992.24s)]
*  And it was just like feeding this old thing. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=993.04s)]
*  But it was crazy how quick it would go from, maybe if I had asked a girl to a dance, [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=996.0799999999999s)]
*  or even if I just had some interest in my head, but she never looked at me or something. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=1001.52s)]
*  And I would immediately be like, God, man, what a fucking, you must just have, [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=1005.52s)]
*  you must just be gross. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=1011.76s)]
*  Is that crazy to say that to you? [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=1014.8s)]
*  Not at all. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=1016.56s)]
*  Because shame, one of the most powerful aspects of shame is that it creates this inner critic [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=1017.1999999999999s)]
*  in our brain that's caught no matter what we do, it criticizes it. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=1023.4399999999999s)]
*  It finds fault with it. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=1027.84s)]
*  And if we fail, especially it just beats us up. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=1029.68s)]
*  And like we're in the dog house for weeks. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=1033.04s)]
*  It's just vlogging us. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=1035.8400000000001s)]
*  And it's just loud and it is brutal there. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=1038.32s)]
*  It would be everything. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=1043.2s)]
*  You're poor. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=1043.92s)]
*  Your body's gross. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=1044.48s)]
*  You're ugly. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=1045.6000000000001s)]
*  You're stupid. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=1047.2s)]
*  You're ugly. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=1048.4s)]
*  You're stupid. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=1048.88s)]
*  Nobody, everybody want you. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=1049.28s)]
*  You're never amounted to anything. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=1050.56s)]
*  You're a failure. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=1051.8400000000001s)]
*  Oh, I mean, it was like a machine gun. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=1052.72s)]
*  Yes. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=1055.2s)]
*  Um, and the craziest part was now I have a little bit more rev, I'm able to see it more, [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=1055.8600000000001s)]
*  but man, for 30 years of my life, I couldn't even see it. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=1061.14s)]
*  Yes. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=1064.66s)]
*  And that's, so what happens, complex trauma for most people begins from birth. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=1065.3s)]
*  Okay. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=1073.8600000000001s)]
*  And so it's pre-memory time, pre-verbal time. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=1074.9s)]
*  And so a lot of the stuff that's happening in their brain is all happening subconsciously. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=1078.5800000000002s)]
*  They're, they're not thinking about it. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=1083.3s)]
*  They're, they're, they're an infant. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=1085.14s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=1086.74s)]
*  It's all subconscious. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=1088.3400000000001s)]
*  So your whole subconscious brain is forming, is forming with all this negative stuff. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=1090.1000000000001s)]
*  And that's a real tragedy of complex trauma is it shaping the brain in the infant ears [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=1097.3000000000002s)]
*  with negative messages, lies, negative perceptions that you're not even aware of there. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=1103.46s)]
*  You just think are normal. [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=1111.7s)]
*  And those can be like a parent not looking at its child and not interacting. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=1113.3s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=1117.6200000000001s)]
*  There's probably countless things that could create trauma at that age, right? [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=1119.06s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=1123.46s)]
*  So what we know as a child needs to feel safe. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=1124.5s)]
*  They need lots of hugs and touches. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=1128.5s)]
*  They need eye contact. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=1131.8600000000001s)]
*  That's how they learn to regulate that. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=1133.78s)]
*  So they learn to feel and experience emotions by picking up on the parents' emotions. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=1135.78s)]
*  That's how their emotions get calmed by looking into somebody who's calm. [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=1141.62s)]
*  But if they don't have that, then it's like, it's me against the big bad world. [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=1146.98s)]
*  And I'm only one week old. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=1152.18s)]
*  Like it's, it's too overwhelming. [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=1154.18s)]
*  It's too scary. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=1156.5s)]
*  Yeah. You got to be a gangster suddenly. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=1157.46s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=1159.46s)]
*  And you're only seven days old. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=1159.86s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=1161.46s)]
*  Then you can't even carry a gun. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=1162.02s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=1163.62s)]
*  And so that's a lot of pressure. [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=1165.3s)]
*  Ah, imagine the pressure that a kid starts to feel. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=1166.98s)]
*  A child starts to feel. [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=1169.78s)]
*  And that's why I say that your stress system is activated. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=1171.62s)]
*  And that's what we mean. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=1175.78s)]
*  That's complex trauma. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=1176.8999999999999s)]
*  So that makes sense as to why, like if certain things will happen in adulthood, [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=1178.66s)]
*  it'll immediately cause stresses in me, even if it's just normal. [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=1182.1s)]
*  Like I'd have a lot of instances where, like even in intimacy situations with women, [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=1185.94s)]
*  like somebody would touch me and it would make me, I like would feel, [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=1190.42s)]
*  I'd feel overwhelmed. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=1197.54s)]
*  Yes. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=1198.66s)]
*  I would feel, yeah, it was just like crazy. [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=1199.46s)]
*  It was just, I don't know. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=1204.1799999999998s)]
*  It was, and then I felt bad about myself. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=1206.5s)]
*  Because again, the second something was a little bit off, [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=1210.58s)]
*  it would get into that back onto that Ferris wheel of man. [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=1214.02s)]

*  Yeah. [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=1393.3s)]
*  I think it's really helpful to understand trauma. [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=1394.1s)]
*  You really need to understand our central nervous system. [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=1398.02s)]
*  It's really made up of two parts. [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=1401.4599999999998s)]
*  There's the sympathetic nervous system and the parasympathetic. [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=1403.2199999999998s)]
*  The sympathetic is your work energy. [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=1406.98s)]
*  It gives you the energy to fight or flight, to work hard, get up in the morning, go, go, go. [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=1410.5s)]
*  Then you need a parasympathetic, a balancing part. [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=1417.3799999999999s)]
*  That's your rest, healing, restoration piece. [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=1420.1799999999998s)]
*  So a child has to have that in balance to be healthy, to grow. [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=1424.1s)]
*  But what happens in complex trauma when you're in danger all the time [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=1429.1399999999999s)]
*  is you're in your sympathetic all the time. [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=1432.5s)]
*  Because you got to be on guard. [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=1436.1s)]
*  You got to be going. [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=1437.4599999999998s)]
*  You got to get validation. [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=1439.06s)]
*  You got to prove yourself. [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=1440.82s)]
*  You got to work. [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=1441.9399999999998s)]
*  You got to earn. [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=1442.74s)]
*  So you got to go, go, go. [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=1444.26s)]
*  You're driven. [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=1445.9399999999998s)]
*  And so the brain helps you with that. [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=1448.34s)]
*  It releases cortisol when fear is in your stress system activated and that releases adrenaline. [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=1450.6599999999999s)]
*  So you can go on adrenaline. [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=1457.22s)]
*  That gives you lots of energy and you feel, hey, I can pull this off. [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=1458.34s)]
*  And if you're young, you've got the resources to do that. [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=1461.6999999999998s)]
*  But the problem is you're not engaging your parasympathetic. [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=1465.1399999999999s)]
*  And usually around 30 or so, it catches up with you. [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=1468.8999999999999s)]
*  Wow. [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=1472.82s)]
*  And all of a sudden your body says, I'm not doing this anymore. [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=1473.78s)]
*  You're burning me out here and I'm going to start shutting down. [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=1477.8600000000001s)]
*  And one of the first things it does to help engage the parasympathetic [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=1481.6200000000001s)]
*  is to bring on depression. [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=1486.02s)]
*  Because depression brings in the parasympathetic [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=1488.58s)]
*  and it forces you to slow down. [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=1490.9s)]
*  It forces you to shut down. [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=1492.66s)]
*  And then for some they keep pushing. [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=1495.6200000000001s)]
*  They keep pushing and some go to drugs because drugs will give you the energy to keep going. [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=1498.34s)]
*  And they keep, then your body actually just burns itself out and shuts itself down. [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=1503.7s)]
*  Then you have a total, not just an emotional burnout, you have a physical burnout. [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=1508.98s)]
*  Wow. [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=1513.6200000000001s)]
*  So your body can create depression in order to give the parasympathetic, [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=1513.8600000000001s)]
*  because then you're at least going to slow down. [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=1519.14s)]
*  You're going to, even if there's these other side effects of how you feel about it. [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=1520.8200000000002s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=1524.9s)]
*  So what happens to a little child is how do they learn the parasympathetic? [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=1526.1000000000001s)]
*  They, we call it co-regulators. [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=1531.46s)]
*  So mom or dad is regulated emotionally as calm. [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=1534.4199999999998s)]
*  They're in their parasympathetic. [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=1537.86s)]
*  So they look them in the eyes and they regulate their own nervous system to mom and dad. [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=1539.54s)]
*  But if mom and dad are absent or mom and dad are angry all the time, [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=1545.78s)]
*  your regulator's not there or they're regulated. [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=1551.9399999999998s)]
*  So they're triggering you and keeping you full of fear and anxiety. [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=1554.8999999999999s)]
*  Wow. [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=1559.54s)]
*  So it's messing you up. [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=1560.44s)]
*  Or if you have parents that just are work, work, work, if you relax, you're lazy. [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=1563.56s)]
*  If you're relaxed, you're selfish. [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=1569.96s)]
*  They're forcing you by this work ethic to be out of balance. [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=1572.36s)]
*  And actually it's creating very subtle complex trauma because you're just a workaholic [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=1578.76s)]
*  and you feed off it and you're driven. [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=1585.0s)]
*  But what happens is that's normal. [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=1587.1599999999999s)]
*  Right. [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=1589.6399999999999s)]
*  So then you're creating a normal that is extremely abnormal. [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=1590.1999999999998s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=1593.48s)]
*  Man, I, yeah, just to have some like, yeah, my mother didn't look at me, right? [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=1594.4399999999998s)]
*  When I was a child, I don't remember. [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=1604.9199999999998s)]
*  I don't like, and I don't say that I don't need sympathy or anything. [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=1606.6s)]
*  I'm just saying that as an adult, right? [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=1611.1599999999999s)]
*  Recognizing that this child wasn't looked at in the eyes. [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=1613.32s)]
*  My mother, like, I love my mother. [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=1616.28s)]
*  I'm thankful for her. [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=1617.8799999999999s)]
*  I'm glad I exist. [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=1619.08s)]
*  But yeah, she, if there were an emotional thing, she couldn't connect. [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=1622.6s)]
*  Like she almost had like an emotional autism. [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=1627.3999999999999s)]
*  Yes. [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=1629.3999999999999s)]
*  Like if I, if they were physical, if I got hurt, she could help. [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=1629.8799999999999s)]
*  Right. [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=1633.96s)]
*  The second I got hurt. [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=1634.44s)]
*  But if I'm sitting across from her feeling a certain way, it doesn't even, it's like, [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=1635.6399999999999s)]
*  she can't come to me. [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=1640.52s)]
*  She wouldn't hug me for more than like half a second. [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=1641.72s)]
*  Okay. [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=1644.76s)]
*  And I'm not saying that as like a whiny baby. [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=1645.96s)]
*  I'm just, I'm trying to relate to some of the stuff you're talking about. [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=1647.64s)]
*  So one of the things that happened was I noticed as I got older, I didn't know how long, [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=1652.6000000000001s)]
*  and my father was a senior citizen and he was really absent. [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=1657.24s)]
*  I didn't know how long to look into somebody's eyes. [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=1661.0800000000002s)]
*  I didn't know how long to look into somebody's eyes. [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=1664.28s)]
*  I didn't know how long to look into somebody's eyes. [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=1666.68s)]
*  So I'd have this weird stuff sometimes where I would like check in with somebody's eyes, [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=1668.68s)]
*  but then look away while I was explaining myself, man. [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=1673.24s)]
*  Yes. [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=1675.8s)]
*  Makes me feel bad for myself. [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=1676.76s)]
*  Not, it doesn't make me feel bad as an adult, but it makes me feel bad. [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=1678.04s)]
*  Yes. [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=1680.6000000000001s)]
*  That that kid had to do that. [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=1683.24s)]
*  So can I speak scientifically to that again? [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=1684.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=1687.64s)]
*  Okay. [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=1688.14s)]
*  Okay. [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=1688.64s)]
*  So the first response to danger is the brain releases cordia. [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=1691.64s)]
*  So the danger is the brain releases cortisol, which is adrenaline, [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=1696.2s)]
*  and that gives you the energy to fight or flight. [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=1699.96s)]
*  So you can fight harder, you can run faster because you got adrenaline happening. [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=1704.3600000000001s)]
*  But if you're too little to fight or flight, then that's cortisol is not doing you any good. [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=1709.88s)]
*  And if your parents are punishing you for being angry, etc., [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=1718.44s)]
*  the brain then switches and produces opioids, natural opioids, and it says we're going to [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=1722.44s)]
*  shut down. And so what happens with that is that you dissociate, you move inward and [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=1729.08s)]
*  all the blood comes from the muscles around the heart because it's basically saying we're [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=1735.6399999999999s)]
*  going to get ready to get hurt. We're going to get ready to get cut so we don't bleed as much. [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=1740.6s)]
*  So we're going to put all the blood around here so that if we get hurt out here, cut out here, [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=1746.52s)]
*  nothing is, we're not going to bleed as much. [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=1750.92s)]
*  Really? Your body does that? [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=1753.0800000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=1754.2s)]
*  No way. [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=1754.6000000000001s)]
*  Yeah. So your body's now gone to that fight or flight don't work, so now we're going to freeze. [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=1755.3200000000002s)]
*  And so then what some kids learn in freeze is, but I still need my needs met, so now I learn to fawn. [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=1762.04s)]
*  So I will learn to say whatever you want me to say, be whatever you want me to be, [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=1769.0800000000002s)]
*  just don't hurt me, just put up with me. [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=1775.0s)]
*  Wow. [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=1777.96s)]
*  So that's your four F's that develop, but what happens- [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=1779.08s)]
*  What are they against so we know them? [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=1784.28s)]
*  Fight, flight, freeze and fawn. [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=1785.88s)]
*  Wow. [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=1787.88s)]
*  But what has happened is, so fight or flight, you're basically, your emotions are out there. [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=1788.68s)]
*  Freeze, your emotions go in, you shut them down. And so most people with complex trauma [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=1797.32s)]
*  don't do well with emotions. They shut down emotions. They don't even know they have emotions. [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=1804.28s)]
*  And so what we say is that most complex trauma families, they have three emotions, mad, sad and glad. [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=1809.56s)]
*  So dad can be mad, mom can be sad, but the kid's got to be glad. [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=1816.8400000000001s)]
*  Man, yeah, I remember like, I would ask people, how do I feel about this? Which is crazy, man. [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=1823.32s)]
*  I know some of this I know sounds maybe crazy to some people, but yeah, I remember I just didn't [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=1832.84s)]
*  even have any, I didn't know how I felt about anything. I just knew how you felt and how I [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=1837.96s)]
*  needed to seem. [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=1845.72s)]
*  Yes. And so what happens to a child who's fawning is I'm more attuned to how you're feeling than to [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=1846.68s)]
*  how I'm feeling. [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=1853.24s)]
*  Oh yeah, I was fawn, I was a damn bambi, baby. You know what I'm saying? I was like a bambi in Memphis. [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=1854.04s)]
*  So I know your emotions better than my own. I know what you think and believe more than what I think. [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=1859.08s)]
*  Right. [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=1864.6799999999998s)]
*  Because that's how I need to survive is I need to be more attuned to you than I am to me. [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=1865.32s)]
*  Yeah, for me, I noticed like, well, for a long time, I didn't know what was going on. And for me, [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=1872.04s)]
*  I got into recovery programs in the 12 step and that helped me for the first time, have a little [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=1879.3999999999999s)]
*  bit of a clue. I heard people share stuff that things I could never put into words. [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=1885.8s)]
*  Okay. [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=1892.12s)]
*  You know, I mean, that was one of the blessings about being in, so I was recovery in 12 step rooms [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=1892.4399999999998s)]
*  was you had like 20 people thinking at once. And so sometimes someone would say what you [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=1896.52s)]
*  have to wanted to and couldn't. And so that gave me a first start to look at my, [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=1903.56s)]
*  at myself. I was so like, I was so stuck to me. I couldn't see me at all. [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=1908.84s)]
*  Well, and so some ways that, like things that were having a tough time in my life, [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=1921.48s)]
*  huge problems trusting people didn't trust huge problems with that. One thing I noticed [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=1927.8799999999999s)]
*  really recently still unrealistic expectations of myself and other people. And I've always had them. [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=1934.84s)]
*  You know, it's like, and I realized that it's, I think some of it is like, [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=1944.4399999999998s)]
*  I want to make it so like, if I have unrealistic expectations of myself, [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=1952.1999999999998s)]
*  then I'm never going to be able to achieve them. [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=1956.76s)]
*  The bar is too high. [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=1958.6s)]
*  Right. And then I'll always be what I thought I always was anyway. [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=1959.56s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=1963.72s)]
*  Which was not enough. [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=1964.44s)]
*  And so that's where shame creates a self-fulfilling prophecy. [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=1965.64s)]
*  Yeah. So that's like, and now I'm able to see that a little, [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=1969.72s)]
*  but before I was just stuck on that Ferris wheel. [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=1975.3200000000002s)]
*  Yep. [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=1978.2s)]
*  And I still, it still happens. That's a tough one recently for me. [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=1980.3600000000001s)]
*  Oh, self-pity. That was a huge one. That was my biggest drug in life that I never realized [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=1986.44s)]
*  was self-pity. And I reframed it for myself. I was like, oh, if I just keep trying, [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=1992.52s)]
*  I'll get everything. I have to work harder. I have to be better. [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=1997.88s)]
*  I can't go do something fun with my friends. I need to stay and write a book. Or it was just like [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=2002.8400000000001s)]
*  unreal, these unrealistic expectations. But I was always keeping myself in a place of self-pity [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=2007.56s)]
*  without realizing it, because that was a side effect of having unrealistic expectations. [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=2013.64s)]
*  And man, that self-pity was, but it looked like on the outside, [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=2018.9199999999998s)]
*  I was trying to better myself. So it was, I was always, does it make any sense? [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=2022.9199999999998s)]
*  So can I ask you with that? Because what you're describing is very common in the world I work in. [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=2028.04s)]
*  So a lot would say unrealistic expectations. So you're always setting the bar too high for yourself, [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=2033.56s)]
*  which is always leading to failure, which is self-pity as the aftermath. But what you're thinking [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=2039.8799999999999s)]
*  is, but I'm trying, I'm trying, I'm trying. But what's happening often with the self-pity. [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=2047.48s)]
*  And so here's my question is there's this growing sense of helplessness and hopelessness. [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=2052.44s)]
*  Did you go through that? Or was there always, I can somehow rise above if I just dig a little [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=2059.88s)]
*  deeper. That was me. Okay. And that's what I was talking about with the sympathetic nervous system. [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=2065.32s)]
*  I'm getting tired. I'm starting to burn out, but if I dig a little deeper, I can push, [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=2073.08s)]
*  I can push, I can keep going until you eventually do burn out. [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=2079.24s)]
*  Yeah. That's where societal, the society affected me because there was always that [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=2083.48s)]
*  you have to grind harder. The 70 minute work week or something, or like, you know, [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=2088.6s)]
*  the four minute relationship. There's all these books that are like, what is unrealistic, man. [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=2093.48s)]
*  The 52nd life. And you're like that. I don't want to do that. And so that's where society even [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=2100.36s)]
*  pushed me even further. And about four years ago, I had like a breakdown. It was like, [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=2107.1600000000003s)]
*  I was burnt out. I couldn't even listen to somebody talk because there was no, [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=2112.28s)]
*  yes, concentrate. And it made me, it physically exhausted me to listen to somebody in a conversation. [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=2116.04s)]
*  And I kept working. Yes. There's an episode of this podcast where I felt it was just, man. And [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=2122.92s)]
*  this is the fact that I, then I started to feel bad that I treated myself that way, you know? [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=2129.0s)]
*  Anyway. Can I share a little bit from me? Yeah, please, man. I got into this work over 20 years [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=2134.68s)]
*  ago, but that was after seven years of burnout. Wow. So I had worked for, [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=2141.48s)]
*  until I was 32 and all of a sudden I was just tired all the time. I couldn't sleep. I was [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=2148.76s)]
*  just, and my eyes were getting like, my wife would go, something's wrong with you. Your eyes [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=2156.1200000000003s)]
*  are really looking weird. Yeah. You're looking big. You're about to eat a fly. They get dark. [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=2161.08s)]
*  And it's, and, and then went to doctor after doctor and eventually put me on disability, [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=2165.88s)]
*  but I went through seven years of depression. And I was like, I'm going to go to the doctor. [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=2172.1200000000003s)]
*  I was going through depression and hell and anxiety. And, and when I came to the end of [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=2178.36s)]
*  what the government would give me for disability, I had to go back to work. So I just worked on [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=2186.28s)]
*  farms. I milk cows. I took care of horses. Oh yeah. And that was very healing for me. That was very [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=2191.2400000000002s)]
*  therapeutic. But then a lady I knew, she came to me and said, Tim, we really need help with this [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=2197.88s)]
*  and I think you'd be the perfect counselor. And that cows out of milk. [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=2206.6s)]
*  And I said, I said, I think you got the wrong guy. I can't go back to that world. And she's, she [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=2211.56s)]
*  came back about three months later and she said, Tim, I think you're the guy. Please give it some [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=2220.92s)]
*  thought. And I said, okay, I'll go for the interview. Um, but when I went for the interview and I said, [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=2225.56s)]
*  okay, I'll give it a try for three months. But I told myself, if you don't make some major changes [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=2231.16s)]
*  and how you go about working, you're not going to make it. So you got to radically change your [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=2236.92s)]
*  boundaries in life and people pleasing and all of that. But the first week, as I was working [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=2245.64s)]
*  with these people with trauma and addiction, I was like, this is what I was made for. Wow. [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=2253.0s)]
*  These are my people. And I fell in love with it, but it came after all of, all of my work came [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=2259.0s)]
*  after seven years of hell burnout that I brought on myself because of my trauma. [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=2266.36s)]
*  But you didn't know it though, right? No, I thought I was doing the right thing by pushing [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=2274.36s)]
*  myself. I was being a responsible father and husband. And so I had a four year old, a three [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=2278.68s)]
*  year old and a one year old. Wow. So you guys were really making love on the soul. And all of a sudden [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=2286.36s)]
*  their dad just was sick and in bed all the time. And they basically all went through abandonment [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=2292.04s)]
*  trauma because their dad disappeared from their life for seven years. Um, and were you using [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=2298.6s)]
*  drugs? Did you use pills and stuff? You didn't, you were just depressed. Yeah. Wow. Well, one of the [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=2305.1600000000003s)]
*  toughest things I found when I had, when I was struggling was, uh, when I was physically [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=2309.88s)]
*  struggling, right? Like I'd gotten so depleted, um, that all the doctors I would go to, they [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=2314.28s)]
*  couldn't really diagnose it. You know, they would take my blood. Chronic fatigue syndrome. Yeah. [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=2321.6400000000003s)]
*  And you're looking up all these crazy things and then you're wearing, you know, like at one point [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=2326.52s)]
*  I was just like, I had on like one of those, I'd bought like a posture organizer from the, uh, [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=2330.6000000000004s)]
*  thing. And I just had like a couple, like some shake weights and some like some weighted [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=2335.88s)]
*  anklets on and people are like, what are you doing? And I'm like, they say this works, you know, [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=2340.52s)]
*  like try the bracelet. Oh, my woop bracelet just kept calling an ambulance. And people bring me little [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=2345.64s)]
*  mason jars of their home concoctions that were going to cure me. Uh, [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=2352.92s)]
*  and yeah. Um, and one of the toughest places for me too was it was relationships and it still is, [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=2360.6s)]
*  you know, um, it still is, uh, a really tough space for me. [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=2367.72s)]
*  It's that also goes to unrealistic expectations. [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=2375.3199999999997s)]
*  You know, I don't, if things get tough, I'll leave, you know, um, you know, I, [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=2379.48s)]
*  I, you know, I heard you talk about fake intimacy once. Do you know what I'm talking about? Yeah. [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=2387.56s)]
*  What were you talking about about it? I resonated with that. [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=2392.6s)]
*  So every child longs for connection. Yeah. Just built. But if you can't get it, you try to [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=2396.04s)]
*  connect with dad, but he's always too busy. Mom's always depressed or angry. You can't connect. [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=2402.2799999999997s)]
*  So you assume it's my fault. I must be something wrong with me, but I'm still driven for connection, [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=2408.92s)]
*  but I don't want deep genuine connection now, cause that's always led to rejection. [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=2415.96s)]
*  So let's try bar room intimacy. Let's try fake intimacy. Let's just have fun all the time and [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=2421.0s)]
*  sports pervert. Yeah. Set. Yeah. Pornography, that sort of thing. Yeah. Cause it gives the [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=2428.2s)]
*  feelings of connection without the true intimacy. Yeah. But it doesn't satisfy. No. But it, and it [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=2433.96s)]
*  sets up addiction. Um, and that's where most people end up sadly straying into that fake intimacy [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=2441.48s)]
*  world. Yeah. Like would you, do you think it's safe to say that complex trauma makes, um, [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=2450.44s)]
*  having a healthy relationship in pot like, like it's gotta have a huge effect. Yeah. [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=2458.28s)]
*  Very much. And impossible even no, makes it almost impossible for a healthy relationship. [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=2466.12s)]
*  So everybody that I deal with, um, as long as they're single, they don't think they need to [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=2474.9199999999996s)]
*  work on their trauma. Cause yeah, just me, I'm, I'm surviving. As soon as they get in a relationship, [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=2482.4399999999996s)]
*  then they start damaging the other person. Then they have kids, they're damaging their kids. And [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=2488.4399999999996s)]
*  all of a sudden they go, I got it. Start working on my crap. Um, but then they go, okay, I'll just [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=2492.52s)]
*  change this. I'll change this, but it's not working. Why is it not fixing the relationship [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=2498.8399999999997s)]
*  and it's cause you're trying to fix the symptoms. You're not dealing with the root issues, that [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=2503.72s)]
*  deep shame, that deep lack of trust, that deep fear of intimacy and fear of abandonment. And as long [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=2509.8799999999997s)]
*  as those are still there, they're going to keep getting in the way of true healthy relationships. [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=2517.64s)]
*  And so a lot of people, as long as the relationships going along smoothly, it looks [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=2525.9599999999996s)]
*  pretty good. But as soon as there's the slightest thing that triggers their fear of abandonment or [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=2530.52s)]
*  triggers their shame, big explosion, they go back to old behaviors. All of a sudden they're in fight, [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=2536.12s)]
*  flight or freeze mode. They're lashing out, they're running away. And that's when all the damage [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=2542.92s)]
*  happens. Um, and after a while, there's so much baggage from all the damage that you just can't [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=2548.68s)]
*  repair it. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, personally, I like, I would, yeah, I've had problems, [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=2554.52s)]
*  certainly problems with, uh, not cheating in relationships. I've never, I've always, [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=2560.7599999999998s)]
*  I think I've cheated in every relationship I've ever been in sadly, you know, um, uh, let me think, [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=2567.24s)]
*  oh, um, like, like would have problems with sex and stuff, but if the person was going to leave me, [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=2574.84s)]
*  then I could have, it was like my body would then entertain it, you know, but otherwise, uh, like, um, [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=2585.0s)]
*  yeah, or if it was with a stranger, it was easier, you know, uh, not a complete stranger, [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=2594.2000000000003s)]
*  like somebody at a mall or something, but like, um, you know, with somebody, you know, [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=2598.76s)]
*  a bar sex or somebody who's like that, or just somebody you met at a service area or whatever, [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=2602.84s)]
*  but, um, yeah, that kind of stuff. Uh, Oh, staying with somebody, [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=2607.96s)]
*  man, this is, this is this staying with somebody, uh, [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=2617.96s)]
*  because I didn't want them to have somebody else who would really care about them. Yes. [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=2627.32s)]
*  Or that could care about them better than me. Um, even though I knew I was doing a bad job. [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=2631.8s)]
*  Yeah. Man, it makes me feel, uh, I'm not proud of that. And I didn't know, but some, a lot of it, [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=2637.08s)]
*  man, I didn't know until later, you know, I just couldn't see it. Uh, but yeah, stuff like that. [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=2644.84s)]
*  Um, Oh, thinking that my partner, a woman, if my girlfriend or whatever, if they did something [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=2650.6s)]
*  wrong, then it was me doing it wrong. Yes. Like, um, yeah. Oh gosh. If they, if they're a little [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=2658.84s)]
*  off or something, or they, uh, do things away that people don't like, that's a reflection of me. [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=2664.92s)]
*  Totally. Yes. You know, those are some symptoms that I had, you know, can I talk scientifically [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=2670.84s)]
*  again? A hundred percent. You can talk in any fashion you want about it. So to me, it's so [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=2677.6400000000003s)]
*  interesting, especially living in the West is so much of our dating and attraction in [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=2683.48s)]
*  relationships is really what we've come to understand is the limbic or the emotion part [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=2690.36s)]
*  of the brain and the chemical oxytocin, which is what makes me feel in love. And so that's [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=2695.64s)]
*  released through when I see somebody pretty, when I touch them, when I kiss them, when I have sex, [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=2701.88s)]
*  all of that releases those feel good chemicals. And I feel in love. I feel it's going to last [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=2707.48s)]
*  forever. I feel intimacy, though it's not true intimacy. It's the feeling of intimacy. Um, [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=2712.6s)]
*  so that's a great starting place for a relationship. The problem is you can't sustain [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=2720.36s)]
*  that just through sex, just cause you still got life. You gotta communicate. You gotta learn to [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=2725.96s)]
*  accept and love and respect each other. But if you've never been taught how to do that, [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=2731.8s)]
*  you don't. So you just keep trying to have sex, keep trying to have fun, [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=2738.36s)]
*  but the feelings are dying. It's not releasing the same oxytocin. And so [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=2742.6000000000004s)]
*  the relationship is designed to start there, but it's designed then to move to the cortex, [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=2747.2400000000002s)]
*  which is the thinking part of the brain, which then releases all of the serotonin that comes [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=2752.6800000000003s)]
*  through safety, through connection, through acceptance. And that's through building a life, [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=2760.3599999999997s)]
*  working through issues, resolving problems, really respecting, trusting each other. That [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=2766.68s)]
*  takes a lot of work. That takes time. And most people from complex trauma are scared to death [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=2773.7999999999997s)]
*  to go there. So the sex is just, or that intimate connection up top is just like a fuse kind of, [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=2778.52s)]
*  and then the other part is like a fire. Yeah, man. I just, yeah. [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=2784.68s)]
*  But most try it with complex trauma, just think I can live up here on the fuse. [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=2789.8799999999997s)]
*  Yeah, I'm a fuse monkey. I'm up here. Yeah. [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=2794.12s)]
*  That's going to be great. Just never satisfied. [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=2797.08s)]
*  Yeah. And then the second piece to me is what comes out of complex trauma. [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=2800.04s)]
*  Are you familiar with the term gaslighting? [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=2807.96s)]
*  Yeah. But what does it mean? I always hear people say it, but I'm just too bored, [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=2810.2s)]
*  or just too lazy to look it up, I think. So if dad is angry, instead of him being honest [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=2813.56s)]
*  and saying, I'm sorry, I'm having a bad day. You didn't do anything wrong. It's all on me. [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=2821.3199999999997s)]
*  He goes, you're a bad kid. It's all your fault. That's gaslighting. He's twisting it and making [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=2827.3199999999997s)]
*  you believe a lie. And so what happens in complex trauma is constant gaslighting of a child. [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=2833.24s)]
*  So that whenever any parent or authority is having a bad emotion, the child is made to feel [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=2840.04s)]
*  it's their responsibility to fix that emotion. No, it's not. They can't fix their dad's anger. [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=2847.08s)]
*  Only dad can fix his own anger, but they're made to feel if they just did more chores, [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=2854.6s)]
*  if they weren't making noise, if they were more agreeable, more obedient, then dad would never [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=2859.88s)]
*  get angry. But that always gets angry, but you keep believing the gaslighting lie. So now when you go [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=2865.48s)]
*  into relationships, soon as your spouse is a little bit sad, what did I do wrong? Oh, maybe I [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=2872.12s)]
*  should do something here. Maybe I should do this. You still take responsibility for everybody else's [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=2876.6s)]
*  emotions. And that sets up relationships to be codependent. Yeah. I think there was a point I [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=2882.36s)]
*  was like, well, I have to be perfect then. I was like, if I'm perfect, right? If I'm absolutely [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=2891.64s)]
*  perfect somehow, then there's no way I won't get what I need as a child because even in the laws [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=2898.2s)]
*  of the universe, it would feel like that wouldn't make any sense. So can I ask you a question? [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=2906.92s)]
*  So what happens often with a child is they go to that perfectionism where I set the bar too high [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=2914.6s)]
*  for myself that I can be perfect. I will have no limitations. I'll do everything perfectly the first [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=2920.28s)]
*  time, but it also can create a fantasy world where I'm going to be a Superman. I'm going to do [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=2925.96s)]
*  everything wonderfully. I'm going to save everybody. So did you have that fantasy [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=2932.76s)]
*  thinking begin to develop in you? Not that much. I think when this podcast started getting busier [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=2940.6000000000004s)]
*  and have a lot of young guys who had a lot of the same thoughts and feelings that I did about [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=2947.16s)]
*  stuff would reach out as if I knew more than them really. When I really didn't, I was just kind of [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=2951.3199999999997s)]
*  just have been kind of a late bloomer and just learning in front of people, I guess, because I've [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=2959.16s)]
*  talked about more stuff like that over the years. And then that for a little bit gave me a fear of [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=2967.0s)]
*  well, do I have some greater responsibility? Is God thinking I need you to help? There was moments of [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=2973.24s)]
*  not grandeur, but questions of I could easily see that thing start to get in. [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=2981.8799999999997s)]
*  Oh, then I must know everything. It didn't sprout in me, but there were times where [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=2990.68s)]
*  I was like, I would be a failure at that. So thankfully at that point, there was some of that [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=2997.32s)]
*  Ferris wheel that brought me right back down to the shit carnival. But there was some of that. [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=3008.36s)]
*  None of it is a child. I just set out on my own. I remember thinking I'm never going to let anything [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=3016.92s)]
*  define me in this whole world except for me. You never, and I mean, even when I say it now, I can [[00:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=3023.08s)]
*  feel like, I mean, I can fucking feel it in my, like no one is ever going to define me again. [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=3029.72s)]
*  You are not going to have a say in how I feel. And it comes from a place that's so deep in me. [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=3040.44s)]
*  I can't even, I can barely, sometimes I can, it's like the weather changes just enough where I can [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=3047.24s)]
*  see into the window of it a little bit. But the cloud, whatever it is, the [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=3057.4s)]
*  climate adjusts quick again. Can I speak to that just for a minute? Because part of my concern has [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=3061.56s)]
*  been a very popular term these days is ODD or oppositional defiance disorder. So kids are getting [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=3067.96s)]
*  diagnosed with ODD all the time and it's really been pathologized like it's bad thing. You've been, [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=3074.6s)]
*  you're a bad kid because you've got ODD and what you're describing in yourself to me is ODD. I'm [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=3080.44s)]
*  never going to let anybody define me again. That's oppositional defiance. But really it starts out in [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=3086.2799999999997s)]
*  complex trauma and it's a healthy thing. And it's a child who's nobody's accepting me. Everybody's [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=3094.12s)]
*  trying to make me something I'm not. Everybody's trying to control me. Everybody's, I got this rigid [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=3101.32s)]
*  rules, all of this harsh discipline, et cetera. That's not right. That's wrong. That's hurting me. [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=3109.0s)]
*  I need to be able to have some freedom. I need to be able to be myself. And so we rebel against [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=3118.1200000000003s)]
*  what's unhealthy, but people don't see that we're doing something healthy. They just say, [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=3125.4s)]
*  you're rebelling and they pathologize it. Oh, I see. Right. If you're a rebel when you're young, [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=3130.44s)]
*  they're like, Oh, look at this rebel. Exactly. But for you, you're trying to figure it out for [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=3137.96s)]
*  yourself. You're trying to fix what's wrong and make it right. You're not trying to be a rebel. [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=3141.7200000000003s)]
*  You're trying to develop something loving and healthy. But what happens for most kids is then [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=3147.56s)]
*  they gain it. That just gets into their soul. And now even if somebody wants what's best for me, [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=3154.6s)]
*  I'm not going to let anybody define me. So now I'm going to rebel against good and bad. [[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=3161.08s)]
*  And that then becomes a maladaptation. Right. Yeah. A lot of those old safety [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=3167.3199999999997s)]
*  mechanism, a lot of those old survival techniques become tips over the other side of the sea salt. [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=3174.36s)]
*  Right. Yeah. Quick math. The less your business spends on operations, on multiple systems, [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=3180.2s)]
*  on delivering your product or service, the more margin you have and the more money you get to keep. [[00:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=3187.0s)]

*  Yeah and a lot of this, I don't want to get into that self-pity place again. A lot of it is just [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=3417.08s)]
*  looking. I'm trying to look at some of this stuff with you because it's interesting and it's amazing [[00:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=3422.44s)]
*  how it still comes to the surface because a lot of it I haven't resolved. I think I've taken care of [[00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=3429.2400000000002s)]
*  some of the stuff and I have a much better understanding of a lot of it now and I'm able [[00:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=3437.4s)]
*  to see what's going on a lot of times but some of it is still unresolved for me. [[00:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=3445.08s)]
*  So let's go into the very basics of healing. Yeah, yeah. No, I think that's good. Yeah, [[00:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=3450.92s)]
*  I don't want to be like we've had some of the experience. We've had some of that. So yeah, [[00:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=3458.68s)]
*  I want to get into a part of how does one locate their complex trauma so they can begin to [[00:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=3463.08s)]
*  heal it if it's possible. Yeah and that's the huge challenge is that so much of it exists in the [[00:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=3469.88s)]
*  subconscious mind. So we're not even aware of all of these mechanisms and kind of subconscious brain [[00:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=3478.6800000000003s)]
*  templates and programs that have been operating our life. It's almost like we're in autopilot [[00:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=3485.0800000000004s)]
*  and because it's been normal for us all our life, we don't see it as being abnormal or unhealthy and [[00:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=3490.84s)]
*  so that's where taking a program or watching videos where you begin to grow in self-awareness [[00:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=3497.16s)]
*  to understand trauma, to understand the different characteristics of trauma. So we talk about 60 [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=3504.52s)]
*  different characteristics, the patterns in your emotions, the patterns in your thinking, [[00:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=3511.3999999999996s)]
*  the patterns in your behaviour and your relationships and once you begin to grow in [[00:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=3516.04s)]
*  self-awareness then you go oh wow okay now I'm starting to see it but then that goes okay now [[00:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=3521.3199999999997s)]
*  I know what unhealthy is now I can define it. What's what's healthy? I don't know what healthy [[00:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=3528.68s)]
*  and that's where we talk about healing from complex trauma requires reparenting. You need [[00:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=3534.3599999999997s)]
*  surrogate family that can begin to model healthy for you, teach you healthy and begin to help you [[00:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=3539.56s)]
*  learn healthy but that requires the third piece and that is connection and that's the thing I fear [[00:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=3546.6s)]
*  the most. If people get to really know me they're going to reject me but what I've been craving on [[00:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=3554.52s)]
*  my life is true connection with safe people and so trauma requires safe people to heal. [[00:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=3560.2799999999997s)]
*  It's got an academic element of self-awareness but it's got a connection reparenting element as well. [[00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=3567.16s)]
*  Yeah I it's so hard to notice [[00:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=3573.8s)]
*  yeah I would just think I was bad at relationships for a long time I would just think that [[00:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=3582.52s)]
*  you know and I was I mean I was just think that I was a philanderer and man you know kind of deal [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=3588.2000000000003s)]
*  gypsy whatever it is I don't even know what they call it gypsy boy or whatever and then [[00:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=3593.96s)]
*  but yeah I was like and I still don't know how I'm going to do it like if I think about like being [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=3603.96s)]
*  in a marriage a long term I don't know how I could do it right you know I mean I know for a while I [[01:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=3609.4s)]
*  resorted to pornography for a while and uh but that lost it so you know I just learned through [[01:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=3616.84s)]
*  other 12 steps just how negative it is for you and so that's not a solution I mean I still date and [[01:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=3624.2000000000003s)]
*  everything but I don't know if I when I think about that it's like oh that feels harrowing [[01:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=3630.04s)]
*  but it used to be like if I saw a family that was functioning I was like what the fuck is this this [[01:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=3637.64s)]
*  is fucking the dumbest thing I've ever seen that's where I started at yes and that's exactly that's a [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=3643.96s)]
*  real thing yeah and and to even get to the point now where I can even think about being in a marriage [[01:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=3649.4s)]
*  or something for me that's it's been a while you know it's been a it's been a it's been a ride you [[01:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=3655.8s)]
*  know and that to me is a common defense mechanism of people with lots of trauma and shame is I need [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=3660.36s)]
*  to disparage anything that's healthy yeah what the fuck are you doing who are you who do you think [[01:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=3668.6000000000004s)]
*  you are and it's like I got to look down on everybody to feel better about myself even if [[01:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=3673.88s)]
*  I know I should be aspiring to what they're they've got man and it hurts people so much [[01:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=3680.36s)]
*  when they're behaving that way too that's the toughest part is man oh you hurt yourself yeah [[01:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=3687.6400000000003s)]
*  so to me what I say with complex trauma is others wounded me when as a child I develop [[01:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=3693.0s)]
*  mal adaptations the longer I hang on to them the more I just wound myself I don't need anybody to [[01:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=3700.52s)]
*  wound me anymore because I just do a great job myself yeah and I keep the ferris wheel going [[01:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=3706.36s)]
*  you have a program um react it's right is that it react so it stands for recovery education [[01:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=3712.6800000000003s)]
*  for addiction and complex trauma okay so what we found was that 97 percent of addicts have [[01:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=3719.48s)]
*  complex trauma I see so this a lot of this is addiction focus originally and so I started in [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=3728.7599999999998s)]
*  the addiction world and we were the only treatment center in Canada that saw addiction as a symptom [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=3736.52s)]
*  of deeper problems and the lady that trained me said Tim your job is to find those problems [[01:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=3741.72s)]
*  and complex trauma wasn't even on the radar then it was called adult children of alcoholics [[01:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=3748.68s)]
*  yeah or whatever adult children of dysfunction then it became known as developmental trauma [[01:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=3755.16s)]
*  disorder then excuse me then complex trauma came in on the radar but basically what it's saying [[01:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=3760.68s)]
*  is that we always see addiction as a problem but to an addict it was the solution to their problems [[01:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=3768.6s)]
*  and so until we begin to realize what problem are they trying to solve by turning to drugs and [[01:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=3775.64s)]
*  alcohol that deep loneliness the deep pain the deep emptiness that deep longing to feel connected [[01:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=3780.68s)]
*  all of those drugs seem to solve that for them and so we can't really help people with addiction [[01:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=3788.7599999999998s)]
*  by just working on the symptoms we got to get to that rude issue so we start so I was in um part [[01:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=3795.8799999999997s)]
*  of Canada where all the treatment centers were talking about trauma and we got to be trauma [[01:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=3803.24s)]
*  informed and so I asked them like is anybody willing to change their program and none of them [[01:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=3809.72s)]
*  were and I had started some addicts asked me to start a Friday night thing where I'd started [[01:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=3814.8399999999997s)]
*  teaching this stuff so that's where these videos started so I started 17 years ago teaching around [[01:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=3821.56s)]
*  what I was learning and started with 50 addicts coming out and it grew and grew and grew yeah your [[01:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=3828.68s)]
*  channel's fascinating man yeah and so what came out of that was when there were like [[01:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=3836.2s)]
*  10 treatment centers nobody would change their program wow though they all said they needed [[01:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=3843.72s)]
*  to start dealing with the trauma so I said well I guess I I got to start and I didn't want to start [[01:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=3849.08s)]
*  a treatment center but I did so react started as a treatment center for addiction and complex trauma [[01:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=3855.0s)]
*  um and it spread to three different locations in Canada but then COVID hit and um so we put it [[01:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=3862.8399999999997s)]
*  online and then once people heard and we call it Lyft just give it a different name because it was [[01:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=3871.08s)]
*  online and once people heard about it now we have people from 30 different over 30 different [[01:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=3876.12s)]
*  countries that are so that was a blessing huh yeah and so now like thousands are taking Lyft [[01:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=3881.48s)]
*  and it's it's much more intense it's a 15 week um program but you get you get a deep dive into [[01:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=3887.96s)]
*  understanding trauma and then learning what a healthy life looks like and connecting with [[01:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=3896.92s)]
*  a group of people in the journey wow that's incredible man so in the days when treatment [[01:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=3901.08s)]
*  centers just basically worked on symptoms so relapse warning signs triggers and so on and so [[01:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=3909.7200000000003s)]
*  people places and things um halt all of the hungry angry lonely tired yeah all of those [[01:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=3918.52s)]
*  different things what they began to what they saw was their success rate was less than 10 percent [[01:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=3924.4399999999996s)]
*  once we started react and we've kept statistics our success rate is over 50 percent oh Tim that's [[01:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=3932.12s)]
*  great yeah because you're dealing with helping people deal with that core stuff that's been the [[01:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=3938.52s)]
*  issue yeah well one of the reasons that i loved being in a i didn't even know sometimes if i was [[01:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=3944.52s)]
*  an alcoholic right i still question the alcohol part i don't know yeah but i know that i would [[01:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=3949.32s)]
*  sit in meetings and people would get to share how they felt and i never got to do that exactly you [[01:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=3953.72s)]
*  know like i never no one ever asked me how i fucking felt you know it was just like if i had a feeling [[01:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=3959.72s)]
*  whatever it was i didn't even probably know what it was for years i probably thought i had indigestion [[01:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=3966.52s)]
*  in my brain you know like because i know it's like but if i had a fee i just i had to figure it out [[01:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=3971.24s)]
*  myself yeah and um yeah i mean it just so uh when i got into the rooms and people could share how [[01:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=3977.8799999999997s)]
*  they felt and nobody could say anything there's no crosstalk allowed so somebody got to share how [[01:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=3986.04s)]
*  they felt and it just got to sit there and man i didn't know how much of my life my whole life i [[01:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=3991.56s)]
*  needed not even maybe say something but even be in the environment of that yes to have an idea [[01:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=3999.32s)]
*  or a feeling or thought be spoken into the world and have it not completely rejected you know [[01:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=4005.0s)]
*  because sometimes i felt like i've uh yeah i don't know i've got to be careful sometimes not to always [[01:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=4013.32s)]
*  take things back to how i feel because my feet like my feelings sometimes it's like a secret [[01:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=4019.2400000000002s)]
*  it's like you know when somebody puts a dollar on a string i'll go get that dollar right to see how [[01:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=4026.04s)]
*  i feel about something but i'll be they'll pull me back into all that old shame yes so i have to be [[01:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=4031.88s)]
*  careful of that um so what are some of the mechanisms you guys use in react like what are [[01:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=4037.96s)]
*  some of the things that help people get to those core issues so it's it's divided into two phases [[01:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=4045.72s)]
*  so part of what you realize with trauma is it's healing trauma means reprocessing it [[01:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=4052.6s)]
*  that doesn't mean just going into the pain and sitting in the pain as if there's benefit in just [[01:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=4060.7599999999998s)]
*  feeling pain it means i'm going now with tools so that i can learn from it so that i can heal it [[01:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=4065.4s)]
*  so that i can grow through it that's reprocessing it but there's a risk in taking people to reprocess [[01:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=4072.12s)]
*  it because you are opening a can of worms it is going to take them to some pain and trigger them [[01:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=4080.04s)]
*  and so they need what we call agency they need a certain amount of tools before they ever get to [[01:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=4086.7599999999998s)]
*  the trauma or else the trauma is going to overwhelm them i see so you guys work on this so phase one is [[01:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=4093.0s)]
*  self-awareness basic tools emotional regulation what to do if you're triggered building um a safe [[01:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=4099.72s)]
*  community for people so that they can share emotions and not have anybody judge them where [[01:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=4106.92s)]
*  people hold space for them so that's phase one then phase two we start digging into shame we [[01:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=4112.92s)]
*  dig into anger we dig into emotions we dig into boundaries we dig into grief and loss um and so [[01:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=4118.84s)]
*  we start getting into the kind of the main areas of trauma and really help people begin to heal so [[01:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=4126.76s)]
*  the first half of the week is really digging deep into it and then the second half is practical [[01:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=4133.56s)]
*  tools and what does healthy look like shame is such a huge magnet huh huge how does that how [[01:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=4138.200000000001s)]
*  does shame start is that a fair question about shame what's a i think it's it starts with the [[01:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=4146.280000000001s)]
*  parent-child relationship not being right right is shame originally a positive thing there must [[01:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=4155.240000000001s)]
*  be a is there a certain value to a little bit of shame like what is a little bit of shame called [[01:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=4160.84s)]
*  it's like so some people have tried to make a distinction around healthy shame versus toxic [[01:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=4165.72s)]
*  shame right okay but to me healthy shame is actually guilt okay so guilt is if i do something [[01:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=4171.08s)]
*  that violates love i tell a lie i hit somebody i cheat on them i should feel guilty right that's [[01:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=4179.16s)]
*  natural because that motivates me to get back to a a loving healthy situation because as long as i [[01:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=4185.16s)]
*  stay in stuff that violates love i'm destroying relationships i'm making a worse life for myself [[01:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=4191.08s)]
*  so guilt is a good thing and i can resolve guilt so it's about what i do that violates love shame [[01:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=4197.24s)]
*  is about who i am it's nothing about what i do wow so that's huge to notate those two things like [[01:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=4204.44s)]
*  it can be okay to feel some guilt about things it's important that's me getting a sign like hey man [[01:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=4210.84s)]
*  this is a it's almost like a u-turn sign it's like a good road sign really exactly even though it [[01:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=4216.84s)]
*  hurts some you need that because it helps you recognize the motivation you're going against [[01:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=4222.759999999999s)]
*  love exactly you're doing something against love but then shame is unhealthy and i can do nothing [[01:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=4227.88s)]
*  about it so shame is about who i am that i'm not good enough right shame i then attach whatever i [[01:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=4235.88s)]
*  did immediately and that feeling and that's where the two then feed each other so soon as you are [[01:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=4241.0s)]
*  soon as i do something wrong right that proves my shame right that i'm useless and that goes back [[01:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=4246.76s)]
*  to that child that child doing something wrong something's wrong in his world in her world and [[01:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=4252.84s)]
*  they they they don't know how to solve it because they're a child so the and all the only person in [[01:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=4260.36s)]
*  their world is them so if something's wrong in their world or they're not getting what they need [[01:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=4265.88s)]
*  or their needs met then of course there must be their fault so that's where shame builds exactly [[01:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=4269.96s)]
*  so that's where we say that a key part of complex trauma is false guilt so you're made to feel guilty [[01:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=4274.92s)]
*  though you've done nothing wrong which then feeds shame so dad says i'm mad because you're a terrible [[01:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=4283.16s)]
*  kid well no that's not why dad's mad or i drink because you're a terrible kid dad's mad because [[01:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=4289.16s)]
*  he's a lions fan you know exactly and so it's it's you're now feeling i did something wrong [[01:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=4294.68s)]
*  therefore i am wrong right right yeah man and so to help people heal they got to deal with legitimate [[01:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=4302.04s)]
*  guilt they can fix that they got to correct all the lies that led to false guilt so every time that [[01:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=4313.08s)]
*  somebody's impatient with them they go what am i doing wrong you're not doing anything wrong [[01:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=4320.12s)]
*  that's the other person's problem or somebody's upset with them because they said no no you set [[01:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=4324.2s)]
*  a good boundary you shouldn't apologize for that but they feel guilty or they relax for a few [[01:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=4330.6s)]
*  minutes i'm lazy no you're not you're relaxing so you got false guilt from lie after lie after lie [[01:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=4337.0s)]
*  so you got to reprogram that then you got shame that i'm therefore not good enough which is all [[01:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=4343.64s)]
*  based on lies and that's all got to be reprogrammed and that takes a ton of work does it yeah what [[01:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=4349.16s)]
*  does some of that work look like if you even yeah i would say shame to me is the biggest healing [[01:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=4355.16s)]
*  journey that comes out of complex trauma and it takes the longest and takes years because there's [[01:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=4361.4s)]
*  so many thousands of subtle lies that people develop that they don't even realize yeah um and [[01:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=4367.16s)]
*  the problem is they get triggered easily and then all of a sudden they're spiraling downhill that [[01:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=4375.0s)]
*  i'm a piece of shit and they don't know why but it's something's triggered an old lie that's led to [[01:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=4379.719999999999s)]
*  that proves that i'm useless um and so there's a big journey in self-awareness and beginning to [[01:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=4386.12s)]
*  understand the lies that i believe that are below the surface that are subconscious beginning to [[01:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=4392.28s)]
*  understand the things that trigger that begin to understand the patterns that take place once i'm [[01:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=4398.2s)]
*  triggered and where i spiral to and stopping those patterns that's the work and so if i can give one [[01:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=4402.44s)]
*  other piece of teaching yeah okay so it's so key with complex trauma to understand the two parts [[01:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=4410.36s)]
*  of the brain that are kind of the main things that motivate our behavior so the limbic system [[01:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=4417.32s)]
*  which is the emotion center that's the child's brain that's the develops first yes then the [[01:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=4423.0s)]
*  cortex that keeps growing to our 35ish the thinking the executive function it gets called [[01:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=4428.839999999999s)]
*  that processes information the key thing about the limbic brain the child brain is its instant [[01:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=4436.44s)]
*  gratification focus so a child do you want to do your chores or do you want to sit here and watch tv [[01:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=4443.799999999999s)]
*  well whatever makes me feel good right so that determines what i want to do and then whether i [[01:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=4450.919999999999s)]
*  want to do something i don't feel like it i don't feel like doing that or i want a new puppy i feel [[01:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=4458.28s)]
*  like feeding the puppy until i don't feel like feeding the puppy so emotions guide my behavior [[01:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=4465.0s)]
*  and everything is instant gratification focused wow and a lot of that if you're if you had trauma [[01:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=4472.04s)]
*  as a child then you're still even that even that could be a pattern so still continue because [[01:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=4477.88s)]
*  yeah that's a lot of addicts so the key with that is that when fear is triggered that's limbic brain [[01:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=4482.44s)]
*  so if you're in complex trauma you're in constant fear so you're constantly in your limbic brain [[01:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=4488.84s)]
*  so your cortex doesn't develop properly so an adult or a teenager they're going through [[01:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=4493.88s)]
*  gradually switching to their cortex and learning to think stuff through complex trauma you're still [[01:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=4499.96s)]
*  in your limbic brain still thinking only of instant gratification what do i feel like what [[01:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=4505.96s)]
*  everything is about emotions even though you're not aware of your emotions and so a huge part of [[01:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=4511.16s)]
*  what happens with shame when it's triggered is i could be living as an adult today out of my [[01:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=4517.72s)]
*  cortex making good decisions healthy decisions when my shame gets triggered it triggers my limbic [[01:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=4523.24s)]
*  brain again and i go back to a child and i think like a child and i believe the lies of the child [[01:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=4528.76s)]
*  and so what you realize is the the battles in your brain between your cortex and your limbic brain [[01:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=4536.44s)]
*  they believe two different things depends on what gets triggered wow it's almost like you have a [[01:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=4542.36s)]
*  heaven and hell right there kind of exactly oh my god so that's where people with shame they can be [[01:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=4547.72s)]
*  doing wonderful great in relationships and their shame gets triggered and also they're destroying [[01:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=4553.72s)]
*  everybody calling their kids terrible names calling their partner terrible names yeah and it's like [[01:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=4558.2s)]
*  what just happened there while you went to your limbic brain and you acted out of that shame lie [[01:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=4564.280000000001s)]
*  that's when the damage gets done those triggers huh those things it's wild you had to go back to that [[01:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=4570.52s)]
*  yeah so you can you can imagine though how long that would take to heal because when that trigger [[01:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=4577.56s)]
*  hits like it hits with an intensity of a locomotive because it brings with it cortisol it brings with [[01:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=4583.24s)]
*  all the chemicals drugs yeah and how do you stop that like the train's out of the station here buddy [[01:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=4591.08s)]
*  oh yeah if somebody pulls up with a train full of drugs dude it's gone i'm getting on exactly [[01:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=4596.68s)]
*  gonna tell you that right now and i'll probably sit in business class but um yeah my [[01:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=4602.44s)]
*  my brother sometimes would say uh trying to locate that shame and stuff it was like [[01:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=4609.96s)]
*  taking panties out of a bathtub that's what he talks about it like sometimes yeah some days you [[01:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=4615.24s)]
*  get a couple and some days you just you don't even know you're in it yeah so as a person grows in [[01:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=4621.0s)]
*  healing so let's say you would get triggered and you start spiraling but you've got enough [[01:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=4628.52s)]
*  self-awareness you'd catch yourself right and you i know what's going on here then you ground [[01:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=4634.68s)]
*  yourself you regulate your emotions and you get back to your cortex and you go hey i'm believing [[01:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=4639.400000000001s)]
*  lies there i'm not that useless person right and i don't have to do that and you get and so what [[01:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=4644.52s)]
*  you find is all of a sudden that spiral just stopped so instead of being in it for four days [[01:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=4651.400000000001s)]
*  you're now only in it for 15 minutes and you caught yourself now there's going to be a bit [[01:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=4658.04s)]
*  of a hangover effect as you kind of keep working through emotions with it but within a day you're [[01:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=4663.16s)]
*  back to being in a pretty good place and you've grown a little bit and then because of that you [[01:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=4668.28s)]
*  probably won't get triggered as intensely in that area again because you've grown so that [[01:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=4675.88s)]
*  next time something happens the trigger won't be intense and it won't be as frequent and so over [[01:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=4680.28s)]
*  time you're growing with greater infrequency and less intensity until you don't get triggered [[01:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=4686.04s)]
*  there anymore but that can take a few years but it can happen it can happen wow it's really it's [[01:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=4693.96s)]
*  really possible it is yeah man um yeah do you get a lot of people who are feel like at their at [[01:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=4700.36s)]
*  their wits end what are like things you that are you're seeing people doing outside of drugs [[01:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=4707.4s)]
*  patterns that um i would love to if it's okay to hear about some of those um because [[01:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=4713.0s)]
*  i would love people to know that these types of things are repairable yeah i would say some of [[01:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=4719.72s)]
*  the main ones that i would see right now are um mental health issues like major depression anxiety [[01:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=4725.48s)]
*  issues that just make life unlivable really and are really getting in the way of relationships [[01:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=4733.0s)]
*  family stuff like that secondly is anger issues that just the flare-ups and the outbursts that's [[01:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=4739.88s)]
*  what i have and the damage that it does that just brings them to a desperation point that i gotta [[01:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=4747.96s)]
*  get help or i'm gonna lose everything um then with younger people there's this greater and greater [[01:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=4753.88s)]
*  kind of self-harm um suicidal ideation deep in their thinking that's going on eating disorder [[01:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=4761.96s)]
*  stuff that is slowly getting to a point where they go i think i got a problem so that's big [[01:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=4770.52s)]
*  but i think maybe the biggest one right now is the number of people burning out they just are [[01:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=4780.36s)]
*  like working 60 80 hour weeks and they're getting to a point where they're [[01:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=4786.5199999999995s)]
*  just can't do this anymore what's going on with my life um but i think to me the biggest one [[01:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=4791.5599999999995s)]
*  that probably gets people is relationships just especially when they have kids yeah i can't [[01:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=4799.32s)]
*  i gotta be a better dad than my dad was and right now i'm though i said i'd never be like my dad [[01:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=4809.4s)]
*  i'm becoming like my dad i know i can i can man that's got to be tough huh yeah and it's just a [[01:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=4814.68s)]
*  wake-up call for them that rocks their world but that's what they need and what they so that's one [[01:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=4822.6s)]
*  of the biggest pressures you see with people in just that having to be better than their parents [[01:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=4829.88s)]
*  or is it like what do you mean no relationships with kids things just start to get tougher or [[01:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=4833.96s)]
*  get tougher or they fall apart yeah so the you get um their kids start rebelling or their kids [[01:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=4839.16s)]
*  are getting into drugs or their kids are cutting and they're going like i'm failing as a parent [[01:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=4846.52s)]
*  why what's what then they start to think about it and they go yeah okay i get it um i came from [[01:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=4853.24s)]
*  crappy upbringing and i'm passing it on and they i think what they realize is [[01:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=4861.8s)]
*  complex trauma tends to be generational really if i don't deal with it i pass on what i've learned [[01:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=4868.12s)]
*  oh of course and i do it to my kids um because to me that's all i know those the only tools in my [[01:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=4873.88s)]
*  toolbox i'm gonna use them um and so it becomes a generational thing and when you see what you're [[01:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=4880.4400000000005s)]
*  doing to your kids you go the proof's too real i can't do that to my kids because i know what [[01:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=4886.12s)]
*  it did to me um wow that's interesting yeah when you have a child you really get to see the proof [[01:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=4891.96s)]
*  of the recipe you made and then you realize you're the damn ingredient well exactly and the other [[01:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=4896.76s)]
*  piece to that is what happens for a lot of kids is when you're living in constant pain that you [[01:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=4902.04s)]
*  can't resolve you go how do i make the pain go away well i can escape or i cannot care [[01:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=4908.28s)]
*  so don't love anybody shut down love and not care just get hard inside and they can do that [[01:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=4916.5199999999995s)]
*  and pull it off and and look like they're successful until they have kids and all of a sudden love [[01:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=4923.0s)]
*  takes winds huh yeah and all of a sudden they love again and they go uh everything matters now again [[01:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=4931.32s)]
*  and i gotta do something wow that's gotta be scary yeah i got i got two things actually uh [[01:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=4938.36s)]
*  tim so is it possible for parents to do a good job i don't want to get just stuck in this place [[01:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=4945.88s)]
*  where it's like we're just contributing to this thing in the world that everybody's damaged and [[01:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=4952.68s)]
*  that we all need help um that's one question and just so i don't forget when we say like things [[01:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=4956.92s)]
*  are generational do you think that where we are now and like people there's a lot more mental [[01:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=4963.72s)]
*  health issues and stuff like that is it because just how we've gone through time and this is where [[01:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=4970.2s)]
*  we're ending up at as humans um is it because uh you know i've had theories that maybe it's because [[01:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=4978.44s)]
*  we don't have to uh have fear of the like a bear in the woods as much anymore so now that fear [[01:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=4985.88s)]
*  turns inward and so we're hunting this bear inside of us or this lion in the shadows all the time you [[01:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=4992.28s)]
*  know like um but yeah those are those are my two questions like um why do you think it's kind of [[01:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=4997.72s)]
*  coming to a head in a lot of ways and is that just in america too is it just in like western culture [[01:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=5005.16s)]
*  um i would say probably western culture about 10 to 20 years ahead of a lot of cultures and [[01:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=5011.72s)]
*  understanding this um i think to me what's happened is the research scientifically that's [[01:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=5018.28s)]
*  been done on the brain and trauma in the last 10 to 15 years has really started to open people up [[01:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=5028.44s)]
*  to understanding stuff and what we've begun to realize is you can't heal trauma just with [[01:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=5036.679999999999s)]
*  knowledge you need a safe connection oh yeah you got to have an environment where people can talk [[01:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=5044.52s)]
*  about it and people have started to create those environments and people are starting to talk [[01:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=5050.120000000001s)]
*  and so in some ways it's like it's it's a new phenomena but it's the way it should always have [[01:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=5055.88s)]
*  been that we could talk about what's really going on um but we're getting there gradually um but i [[01:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=5062.280000000001s)]
*  think it's really been fueled by a lot of the research that's been happening and the growing [[01:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=5070.6s)]
*  understanding of how magnificent our brains are and how they develop and all of that and how [[01:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=5076.52s)]
*  childhood used to be all about like nurture versus nature and it was all about you know your genes [[01:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=5083.160000000001s)]
*  etc etc really all the evidence is no it's nurture it's it's what's happening in that child's life [[01:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=5089.400000000001s)]
*  that's shaping them and forming how they look at the world and think about themselves [[01:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=5096.36s)]
*  that's the key thing and epigenetics is all about nurture and it even determines how our genes fire [[01:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=5101.24s)]
*  and so it's it's really beginning to understand more scientifically what's been happening that's [[01:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=5110.12s)]
*  been so key i think when it comes to parenting the so a couple thoughts the the danger is [[01:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=5116.84s)]
*  every parent wants to be a perfect parent and it's really important to go [[01:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=5127.56s)]
*  it's all about good enough parenting nobody's a perfect parent but we can be good enough parents [[01:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=5132.84s)]
*  and that means we're going to fail we're not going we can't be super [[01:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=5139.96s)]
*  man to our kids we have limitations we can't be awake 24 7 but we can be good enough so a child [[01:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=5144.68s)]
*  needs parents who are attuned to them and who connect now you don't connect 24 7 with a child [[01:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=5153.4s)]
*  but they need a few minutes a day of just really safe connection with the parent to feel okay this [[01:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=5161.0s)]
*  is my rock this is i'm secure everything's okay with the world and parents can provide that good [[01:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=5168.68s)]
*  enough connection and so what's been so important i think for parents to understand is our whole [[01:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=5175.4800000000005s)]
*  focus in the west as parenting is you got to meet their physical needs physical needs you know you [[01:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=5181.8s)]
*  got to make sure they're get their milk at this time and they get the bed and they have safety and [[01:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=5186.280000000001s)]
*  what we're realizing is the child's biggest needs are emotional needs and there's acceptance [[01:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=5191.64s)]
*  and that attunement and and that connection all of those needs are so important for a child if [[01:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=5199.48s)]
*  they're going to develop normally and healthily yeah and if parents can learn how to meet their [[01:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=5207.8s)]
*  emotional needs of their kids that's what they can do so the other piece of that is [[01:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=5213.8s)]
*  we often talk about dysfunctional family and we think the opposite of dysfunctional is a perfect [[01:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=5221.320000000001s)]
*  family but there's no such thing as a perfect family right so the word dis is actually a greek [[01:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=5227.400000000001s)]
*  word that means pain and so it's a family in pain is a dysfunctional family so it's a family that's [[01:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=5232.92s)]
*  inflicting pain in each other but is never resolving it so it's a complex trauma so the [[01:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=5240.28s)]
*  opposite of a dysfunctional family is a functional family which is a family that [[01:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=5245.88s)]
*  inflicts pain once in a while but they resolve it and by resolving that pain then the child [[01:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=5251.48s)]
*  doesn't traumatize because it's getting resolved right yeah that processing is so huge i think [[01:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=5258.36s)]
*  when i think back on my own life um and not to just talk about my own life i guess [[01:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=5265.64s)]

*  feel like they're chasing their tail running in circles in a fog um they just know they're [[01:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=5329.16s)]
*  supposed to be doing something that nobody's showing them what to do so they're running around [[01:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=5334.76s)]
*  hoping that they're going to figure it out but they're not sure if they're figuring out so there's [[01:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=5339.16s)]
*  just this constant haze of confusion yeah that's there and so unsafe man i remember i mean i wet [[01:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=5342.76s)]
*  the bed i was probably 27 probably yeah i mean i remember at when i would go to bed at night it [[01:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=5350.84s)]
*  felt like i was literally clocking in for a job as like an orderly at a hospital because i knew in [[01:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=5357.16s)]
*  a couple hours i was gonna have to get up and change my sheets and sometimes i wet the bed three [[01:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=5362.84s)]
*  four times a night to be honest and um that's very common with complex trauma i would pee [[01:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=5366.68s)]
*  around my bed i thought that something was going to come get me and i'd heard that like animals will [[01:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=5372.44s)]
*  pee and prevent other animals from coming mark the territory i mean it's when i think back on that [[01:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=5377.24s)]
*  some kid doing that a fucking nine-year-old kid doing that i mean i was like the pattern i had [[01:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=5382.679999999999s)]
*  to go through to look around my room to make sure there was nothing in there was going to get me [[01:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=5388.04s)]
*  it must have taken 12 minutes each night to do it all the exact same way so that i could then get [[01:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=5392.04s)]
*  into my bed man i was and then we get children that um kind of sleep with their back against the [[01:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=5397.8s)]
*  wall facing the door um so that they're not gonna have anybody behind them and and they can see [[01:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=5404.52s)]
*  anything that comes in some even sleep with a weapon nearby in case something happens that's crazy [[01:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=5412.4400000000005s)]
*  yeah and yeah and i think of my stuff my my child is pretty light when i think about what some kids [[01:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=5420.92s)]
*  could go through you know mine was really more neglect it wasn't any abuse you know um but it was [[01:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=5425.72s)]
*  just wandering around in a fucking yeah at an empty cosco with a fucking name tag on wondering [[01:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=5432.92s)]
*  where the manager was you know um anyway sorry sometimes i'm still i still have a lot of anger [[01:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=5440.84s)]
*  about it it's been hard to process over the years yeah no but to me you should and [[01:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=5447.240000000001s)]
*  and yeah if i can just speak to that yeah because to me what happens in a lot of complex [[01:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=5453.8s)]
*  trauma families is anger is seen as bad you're always punished for anger though when you think [[01:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=5460.28s)]
*  about anger anger is actually designed to be something good if something violates love so [[01:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=5465.56s)]
*  somebody lies to me or somebody cheats on me i should get angry because what they're doing [[01:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=5471.96s)]
*  is going to destroy the relationship if they don't fix it so anger is actually a healthy thing that [[01:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=5477.96s)]
*  motivates me to act to say hey this isn't right this is this is wrong but in complex trauma that [[01:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=5485.88s)]
*  gets knocked down never validated judged and so part of the healing journey for a lot of people [[01:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=5492.36s)]
*  is being able to validate their anger yeah i should be angry because that was crap i shouldn't have [[01:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=5499.72s)]
*  been neglected like that now i'm not going to stay there i'm not going to feed it and turn it [[01:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=5505.16s)]
*  into deep bitterness but i need to let that anger be honest if i'm going to heal yes sometimes as [[01:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=5511.4s)]
*  an adult i feel like i've i'm healed from it sometimes but i still feel like that kid is not [[01:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=5520.04s)]
*  happy exactly that's literally what it feels like sometimes yeah like he comes up to the surface of [[01:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=5525.48s)]
*  my fucking throat yes literally he'll be just playing in the distance and he'll run up and [[01:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=5530.5199999999995s)]
*  yell out exactly just right out of the i cannot it's like exactly and and i say okay that's where [[01:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=5534.6s)]
*  he's at you know i'm saying we're gonna keep trying to work with him but um yeah i think a lot of my [[01:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=5541.400000000001s)]
*  a lot of my anger now is from i have unrealistic realistic expectations of people of myself yeah [[01:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=5547.160000000001s)]
*  i didn't even realize it literally to like three or four days ago somebody brought it to my attention [[01:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=5553.56s)]
*  man uh my brother and i was like oh my gosh i've had him since i was at my whole life i've had [[01:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=5557.4800000000005s)]
*  this to-do list that i don't even know i feel like every day i'm already behind schedule and [[01:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=5565.0s)]
*  i don't have a schedule yeah that's what every single i'm running behind gotta do this what is [[01:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=5571.240000000001s)]
*  it i don't know but we better get we i gotta do it and that's how i am like no and nothing no one [[01:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=5579.88s)]
*  can ever do anything perfect enough you know so to tie that in with what you just shared [[01:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=5586.04s)]
*  um what we found with most people with complex trauma is what they begin to realize is it's like [[01:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=5591.8s)]
*  there's a part of them that got left behind that's still a child so some refer to as like their inner [[01:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=5599.72s)]
*  child but the little boy that's still down there and some have a whole bunch of little boys that [[01:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=5606.2s)]
*  are different ages and different well that person is a politician exactly uh but anyways what they've [[01:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=5611.320000000001s)]
*  realized is they there's a part of them that kind of hates that little boy wishes you shut up and [[01:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=5619.4s)]
*  then quit bugging them and grow up and all that kind of treats them like they were treated and [[01:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=5625.96s)]
*  they have to learn to love and nurture that little boy okay because that's part of them [[01:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=5631.719999999999s)]
*  and and just welcome them make space for them be curious what's going on why are you upset like [[01:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=5636.759999999999s)]
*  i'm not going to judge you just help me understand and then help them process through it because [[01:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=5643.08s)]
*  nobody helped them process through it and eventually that little boy can heal um and [[01:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=5649.08s)]
*  so that's a useful tool for a lot of people is beginning to go let's welcome that little boy [[01:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=5655.16s)]
*  and parent that little boy even though it's me but it's part of me and it's a part of me that got [[01:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=5662.44s)]
*  wounded so if somebody's sitting there right now is listening right and they're like how would you [[01:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=5669.5599999999995s)]
*  start to have some of that conversation with yourself and is there a certain setting you would [[01:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=5674.76s)]
*  kind of do it in just to even try and get us some awareness of that inner child as people say [[01:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=5679.64s)]
*  a lot of it's different for everybody and and so you got to kind of find what works for you [[01:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=5687.16s)]
*  what what some people do is they can go in their imagination to kind of a safe place in their house [[01:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=5693.08s)]
*  that they liked as a kid or a safe place in the backyard or a tree or something in the woods [[01:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=5699.96s)]
*  whatever and they can go there and kind of picture that little child and connect with that little [[01:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=5705.4800000000005s)]
*  child others can do it through going through like picture albums see when they're four years old [[01:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=5711.64s)]
*  when they're seven years old oh i remember what i was feeling then and what i was thinking or [[01:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=5717.72s)]
*  the other one is when they get triggered and that voice in their head and they go [[01:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=5723.96s)]
*  well okay that how old do i feel right now and they go i feel three i feel eight and it's like [[01:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=5730.28s)]

*  point when that's happening that part of you is showing up exactly so that's as so easy as it is [[01:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=5750.52s)]
*  it's a great time to connect what i say to people is a trigger don't get down on yourself if you get [[01:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=5755.400000000001s)]

*  we're emotional beings we're relational beings and we're spiritual beings we have to learn to [[01:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=6823.08s)]
*  meet all five the needs of all five of those areas if we're going to be healthy and that's [[01:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=6828.12s)]

*  lives get busy too i can't imagine once people have a family and stuff and a father or mother has to [[01:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=6871.64s)]

*  not sure we're going to be able to share freely so we've been giving thought to kind of what do we [[01:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=6912.28s)]
*  do to kind of people in your status of life that have some popularity that would make things [[01:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=6917.5599999999995s)]

*  might enable celebrity type people to take advantage of the program and still have some [[01:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=6944.92s)]
*  connection with people but maybe not the full connection daily any thoughts on i would love [[01:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=6952.44s)]

*  she wouldn't be able to see it yeah you know um yeah what what types of things can people notice [[01:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=7087.32s)]
*  in their life where they maybe have had complex trauma that they didn't realize it's affecting [[01:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=7095.64s)]
*  this place is there any way we can put some light on that or is that too broad of a question [[01:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=7099.64s)]
*  well i think again for many people workaholic people pleasing never able to say no perfectionism [[01:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=7104.6s)]
*  nothing's ever good enough control freak issues where they're have to control everybody and [[01:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=7112.68s)]
*  everything or image always got to look good and try to impress people all the time or just lots of [[01:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=7119.88s)]
*  relationship problems rifts damage being done now mental health issues that damn that's everybody [[01:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=7128.76s)]
*  tim yeah well exactly and so what we've we started with the react and then the lift course [[01:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=7137.96s)]
*  but not everybody can do that so what we've started now is some self-study courses that [[01:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=7145.88s)]
*  people can take on their own time and then they have an optional group they can go to once a month [[01:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=7150.4400000000005s)]
*  just to kind of share and talk about stuff oh cool have a one-on-one coach if they want to [[01:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=7156.6s)]
*  process through stuff so that's now available um and then we are doing some workshops on [[01:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=7162.68s)]
*  narcissism inner child stuff internal family system stuff shame [[01:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=7170.52s)]
*  issues so we're trying to do more available stuff to busy people [[01:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=7178.12s)]
*  so can i tell you one of my favorite stories to tell people [[01:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=7186.84s)]
*  uh there's actually a video now on youtube where a guy's actually built a bike that operates [[01:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=7192.04s)]
*  backwards so when you think of a bike you learn to ride a bike at four or five six years old [[01:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=7198.76s)]
*  and at first you got to concentrate a lot to get your balance to turn the steering wheel [[02:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=7206.52s)]
*  oh yeah remember how loose the remember how crazy the beginning is falling and but you keep working [[02:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=7212.6s)]
*  and concentrating oh yeah you fall somebody's dad calls you a g-a-y every time you're like [[02:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=7218.68s)]
*  and then pretty soon you could be talking to your buddies and yeah and you're not even thinking [[02:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=7226.52s)]
*  about riding but you're it's so it moves from your conscious brain to a subconscious program [[02:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=7232.04s)]
*  that just operates okay and now you could go without riding a bike for 30 years and jump back [[02:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=7237.96s)]
*  on and you'd ride it without even thinking you just pick it right back up so this guy built a [[02:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=7243.88s)]
*  bike where if you turn the handlebars to the left you actually the wheel goes to the right oh my [[02:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=7251.24s)]
*  gosh why did he do it was he angry at somebody he wanted to test how quickly could you relearn [[02:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=7255.8s)]
*  to ride a bike wow you know how long it took [[02:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=7262.92s)]
*  six months to a year no [[02:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=7269.08s)]
*  yeah so you're just saying to relearn things it takes a while it takes some time exactly especially [[02:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=7270.68s)]
*  when you learn it so young and if somebody's just going to therapy right what can they go talk to [[02:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=7278.84s)]
*  how can they start a conversation with their therapist that could help them create more [[02:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=7284.280000000001s)]
*  ambiance around maybe some of the stuff that may have happened and how it affects them now [[02:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=7288.52s)]
*  yeah so a lot of people go to therapy now because of a crisis in the present [[02:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=7293.08s)]
*  they need to be able to understand that crisis is probably a symptom of something from the past [[02:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=7297.88s)]
*  and so a lot of therapists just try to give you practical tools well try this try this try this [[02:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=7303.24s)]
*  and they're just putting band-aids on cuts on on the symptoms if you can get your therapist to go [[02:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=7307.8s)]
*  like why am i doing this what what's underneath that's driving that response and begin to look [[02:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=7315.88s)]
*  at shame begin to look at fears that are there fears of abandonment fears of intimacy fears [[02:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=7324.04s)]
*  of rejection fears of failure all of those can start getting down to the core root issues that [[02:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=7329.88s)]
*  come out of trauma [[02:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=7337.88s)]
*  yeah sometimes i can ask myself like what's going on you know and try to answer myself you know [[02:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=7341.88s)]
*  on you know and try to answer myself you know like try to legitimately answer myself because [[02:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=7347.24s)]
*  my first thought would be like oh nothing nothing but then it's like well [[02:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=7354.04s)]
*  sometimes a fee i get a feeling first and that's a clue yes a feeling is just like uh yeah it's [[02:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=7359.72s)]
*  just like a little bit of a like you saw something but you don't really know sometimes if i feel [[02:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=7366.28s)]
*  something i try to feel it more like how can i feel this more so there's a new [[02:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=7372.2s)]
*  term called compassionate inquiry and so it's when you get a feeling in the past we get [[02:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=7379.24s)]
*  that critic you stupid why are you feeling that way we judge yourself and get really hard on [[02:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=7386.12s)]
*  ourselves yeah and so it says instead of condemning yourself be curious compassionate so you be kind [[02:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=7393.16s)]
*  to yourself and then go what's going on here and inquire um and you change the whole way you [[02:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=7401.56s)]
*  respond to feelings and triggers which which is huge for a lot of people and you give yourself [[02:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=7408.360000000001s)]
*  some grace too exactly that's the compassion that's it's like to give yourself some grace man [[02:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=7416.52s)]
*  quit beating yourself up give yours just yeah give yourself some grace that you would just [[02:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=7423.24s)]
*  it's the least you can do right now you can do it's [[02:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=7435.5599999999995s)]
*  you know exactly just give yourself a little bit of grace that's one thing i've had a tough time [[02:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=7440.76s)]
*  with um and i would say probably for most of the people we work with self-compassion is the hardest [[02:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=7444.68s)]
*  thing for them to learn why is it hard for us to have self-compassion because shame says [[02:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=7451.56s)]
*  i deserve to beat myself up because i'm a loser and often complex trauma parenting is the way to [[02:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=7458.4400000000005s)]
*  motivate a child to want to change and be better is to beat them up and put them down and punish [[02:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=7465.8s)]
*  them and then they're going to want to prove you wrong or but that doesn't work in the long run [[02:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=7471.160000000001s)]
*  eventually you start to believe you are a loser and you just give up um but you still got all [[02:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=7477.8s)]
*  those things in your head that you keep putting yourself down and then for many people there's [[02:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=7483.48s)]
*  that justice piece that if i commit the crime i got to do the time um and so i did something bad [[02:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=7488.76s)]
*  i'm a bad person i got to punish myself before i can let myself out of prison [[02:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=7496.36s)]
*  hmm and so like there's that sense of justice that has to be served in their mind [[02:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=7501.240000000001s)]
*  and even and so if they're too hard on themselves and they're going to be punished themselves for [[02:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=7509.0s)]
*  crimes that aren't even real and you're in prison forever because you never let yourself out yeah [[02:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=7512.200000000001s)]
*  gosh the crazy thing is i can't even remember some of the ridiculous patterns i used to have [[02:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=7517.56s)]
*  inside of me i used to have this belief that i had to i know it sounds silly but sometimes it feels [[02:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=7521.4800000000005s)]
*  like you swallow on different sides of your mouth i had this thing i had to swallow constantly back [[02:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=7528.28s)]
*  and forth or the world would be even and it was this constant thing all the time it was like this [[02:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=7533.8s)]
*  constant thing um man sometimes when i think back on some of the crazy stuff or little patterns [[02:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=7539.88s)]
*  i think a lot of people have some of it's just being so to me what what you're you've really [[02:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=7547.24s)]
*  shown me this the saft is this it shows the child's amazing ability to think there's got to be [[02:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=7553.16s)]
*  another way to fix this another option available if i try this if i try this if i try to i'll [[02:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=7560.28s)]
*  swallow different and you start to believe that if i only do something a little bit different that'll [[02:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=7567.48s)]
*  resolve and fix the problem but pretty soon you're rocking in your bed you're peeing around your bed [[02:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=7573.08s)]
*  you're sleeping with your back to the wall you're swallowing like you feel you got to control [[02:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=7579.400000000001s)]
*  every little element of life but it's not fixing anything but you're still doing it [[02:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=7584.280000000001s)]
*  yeah but it's the brain just keeps [[02:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=7592.280000000001s)]

*  going till you're in your 30s but eventually you're just wearing yourself out and you go [[02:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=7601.72s)]
*  sopless not man it took me so long to see that i'm just i'm it's like i could yeah it's the hard [[02:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=7606.52s)]

*  toughest parts man is just seeing that thing recognizing that that pattern i used to think [[02:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=7629.240000000001s)]
*  if i was a girl i'm maybe if i was a girl my mother would love me you know um or that i would [[02:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=7634.04s)]

*  that was another thing like i have to i have to always say that i was hypersensitive [[02:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=7714.36s)]
*  not still in but it was like yeah so it was and those are the ones that the neglect affects the [[02:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=7719.639999999999s)]

*  so normal you still are chasing that primary connection yeah and uh you change the face to [[02:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=7766.44s)]
*  a young woman that's not your mother but you're still chasing your mother's once she was the first [[02:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=7775.32s)]
*  girl that i really love so i think it just yeah just awoke all that stuff yeah and you're when [[02:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=7780.36s)]
*  you love you can then you're like oh this is it was yeah this was supposed to happen a long time [[02:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=7785.24s)]
*  ago but now it's happening and this there's probably a part of you that's like this was [[02:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=7789.879999999999s)]
*  supposed to be our mother i don't know i don't know i can get in all that stuff and and also [[02:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=7793.88s)]
*  some of it is like the more i look at all that old stuff it's like trying to find a snake that [[02:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=7798.6s)]
*  bitch or whatever it's like you know it's like it's like a snake bit you and goes off into the [[02:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=7804.2s)]
*  and then you chase it for years right you want to ask it why it bit you you know it's like if it's [[02:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=7809.0s)]
*  gonna fix i just got to heal it what about forgiveness how do what what's your what do [[02:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=7814.12s)]
*  you think about how do you help people with that tim how does react help people with um [[02:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=7819.0s)]
*  i think it's been a it's such an important concept but it's been a badly mistaught concept [[02:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=7826.52s)]
*  so a lot of people have seen the value of forgiveness and so all of a sudden when a [[02:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=7834.6s)]
*  person comes into recovery you need to forgive your mom you need to forgive i go whoa whoa whoa [[02:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=7839.400000000001s)]
*  oh you can't forgive until you've actually validated how badly they've hurt you until [[02:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=7844.36s)]
*  you've got honest about it until you've grieved it until you've been able to really make space [[02:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=7850.28s)]
*  for all the emotions around that then you're going to get to the point where your limbic brain is [[02:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=7855.72s)]
*  sorting out all of those painful emotions and it can come to a point where it can let them go [[02:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=7862.12s)]
*  so forgiveness isn't something you're forcing it's something that's going to naturally happen as you [[02:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=7867.08s)]
*  allow yourself to process through all the pain and anger connected to the wound [[02:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=7873.48s)]
*  man it's wild i had this thought that [[02:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=7881.16s)]
*  there's like this weird thing where it's like i was this part of me is afraid to not be angry [[02:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=7886.839999999999s)]
*  at my mother because it's the only feeling i've ever had towards her yes and if i let go of that [[02:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=7892.759999999999s)]
*  then i won't have any connection to her exactly as a child exactly as an adult i can see my mother [[02:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=7898.76s)]
*  differently you know and um you know i love my mother and i want her to be happy i don't want [[02:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=7906.04s)]
*  her to have to work anymore she doesn't want to you know i wish you can i ask can i ask you a [[02:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=7912.12s)]
*  question so a lot of kids like you that had a mother that just couldn't connect emotionally [[02:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=7917.16s)]
*  often the only time the mother would connect emotionally is when they were bad or when they [[02:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=7923.24s)]
*  got angry then mom would jump in and stop that stop that and they go a little bit of connection [[02:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=7928.2s)]
*  is better than no connection oh interesting so i'll be bad more or angry i would find other [[02:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=7934.28s)]
*  people's i've found other people's moms i mean the second like circuits dude i keep going i went to [[02:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=7941.0s)]

*  way that i can just i could hear him and i that's the hardest part sometimes it's so hard for us to [[02:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=8001.08s)]
*  hear things why partly for a lot of people because of shame is i don't want to stop and [[02:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=8005.64s)]
*  look honestly at myself because it might be too painful and overwhelming and i don't want to go [[02:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=8014.04s)]
*  there so there's so many defense layers that you have to get by before you're even open to [[02:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=8019.160000000001s)]
*  yeah and so a lot of my years of kind of learning how to teach this stuff is how do i get by that [[02:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=8026.12s)]
*  defense layer how do i get right that defense layer how do i make people feel safe to challenge [[02:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=8033.88s)]
*  that area of their life and not feel that they're bad because they're doing that [[02:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=8040.2s)]
*  man it is quite a rubik's cube we're complex huh oh i know what i'd be fascinated by is just kind [[02:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=8047.24s)]
*  of what response you get yeah because i think that's going to tell us a lot about what we could do [[02:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=8054.28s)]
*  differently whether we need to add some other podcasts with more focused information specific [[02:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=8061.0s)]
*  stuff yeah yeah i'm curious about that too i think because i know you have so many like you know there [[02:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=8068.2s)]
*  was a like shame we touched on which i think was important i know that there's a ton of stuff about [[02:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=8073.32s)]
*  guilt um you just there's so many little universes dependency oh god i can't even boundaries um [[02:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=8077.08s)]
*  codependency for sure for sure in the relationship stuff then it's just like [[02:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=8087.32s)]
*  yeah everybody's ears perk up but i think that we try i think we even i think we touched on some [[02:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=8096.44s)]
*  a good understanding though right yeah of complex trauma people can understand maybe that they could [[02:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=8102.36s)]
*  have some things that they didn't realize but also that you don't have to be a victim not everybody [[02:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=8107.16s)]
*  has to have complex trauma yeah um you could have had just simple trauma that was just one thing or [[02:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=8111.719999999999s)]
*  some instances but you could have also had good parenting that was there to help you process it or [[02:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=8116.76s)]
*  somebody even if it wasn't a parent that could also be there as a fixture to help you process [[02:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=8121.64s)]
*  exactly um yeah and i think your bits of your personal story just filled in a lot of that for [[02:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=8126.84s)]
*  people um and i think to me the big picture is everybody needs to learn not necessarily all the [[02:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60u6ObDsrI&t=8132.84s)]
