*  Today's guest is the first Mexican born fighter to win a UFC championship. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=0.0s)]
*  He's a warrior and I'm inspired anytime I get to sit down with any of these fighters. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=8.0s)]
*  I just feel inspired. I feel inspired as I'm sure a lot of you guys do. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=19.0s)]
*  Today's guest is out of the flyweight division. He's the pride of Tijuana, Mexico. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=26.0s)]
*  And I'm very grateful for his time. He is beloved. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=32.0s)]
*  And I'm going to get to know him a little bit better. Mr. Brandon Moreno. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=37.0s)]
*  I think I would like to maybe be... I would probably like to be Mexican I think. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=55.0s)]
*  What? Yeah. Do it. It's the best. Man, do it. Is it hard? Well. To be Mexican. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=83.0s)]
*  Depends. Oh damn. You know, because I mean we can talk about it in... [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=91.0s)]
*  I don't know about this, but my fathers, my parents, they were very poor. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=98.0s)]
*  But they start to work hard, man. And I had a nice life. So I don't have like any necessities in my life. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=107.0s)]
*  My parents was another whole different history, man. It was different, huh? Yeah. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=113.0s)]
*  And so to me was like, oh, I don't have any necessities. Everything was easy. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=118.0s)]
*  Oh, for you it was easy, but for them it was different. Yeah. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=123.0s)]
*  And that life is for the most part of the people in Mexico. It's a tiered world country, man. It's hard. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=126.0s)]
*  Yes. Tough, huh? Yeah. I wish I think, dude, no joke, when I get up in the morning, sometimes I fricking clap for Mexican people because I think that they... [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=135.0s)]
*  If it weren't for Mexican people, America would be... Nobody would be doing any... I feel like Mexican people keep this country going. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=146.0s)]
*  Man, I mean, I have one year living here, man. And I can see a lot of Mexican people like working like hard, man. Hard working. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=153.0s)]
*  Like, man, these guys, all these guys are doing their job just to... [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=161.0s)]
*  And it's everywhere, all across the country. It's like that, man. I think if it weren't for Mexican people, I don't know where... I don't know what America would be, you know? [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=166.0s)]
*  Yeah. You guys are like the real... like the rabitos, you know? [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=176.0s)]
*  What is that? Oh, I don't know. I don't know what is that, man. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=181.0s)]
*  It's like, you know, the animal with the ears at Easter. Oh, rabbits. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=186.0s)]
*  Rabbits, yeah. Sorry, rabbits. Yeah, you guys are the rabbits, man. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=190.0s)]
*  Anyway, thanks for being here. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=195.0s)]
*  Oh, we started already. OK. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=200.0s)]
*  We started, man. But yeah, I think when I die, I would like to come back and be Mexican next time. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=204.0s)]
*  Because it seems there are also a lot of romance and it's more romantic. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=208.0s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, yeah, we were talking about this before, right? [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=213.0s)]
*  I mean, I feel like the Latin culture is like more with more happiness and everything. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=217.0s)]
*  Yeah. That's awesome. Other cultures, they have their own fun in life. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=224.0s)]
*  But I don't know, the Latin culture has a lot of traditions, a lot of amazing food. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=232.0s)]
*  There's this mix of cultures. Yeah, I mean, I mean, I'm so happy and I'm so proud to be Mexican and be Latino. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=238.0s)]
*  So yeah, damn, dude, I wish next time I'm going to be 100 percent Latino. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=246.0s)]
*  Where do you say your father? My father's from Nicaragua. OK. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=251.0s)]
*  But he didn't really he just he talks Spanish with his friends, but he never taught me, you know, but I didn't. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=256.0s)]
*  Really? Yeah, I don't understand why. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=262.0s)]
*  I mean, for example, I have my nephews, my cousins. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=265.0s)]
*  Yeah, they speak both language because in their house was like outside the school, you can speak English all the time. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=271.0s)]
*  But in the house, you need to speak Spanish. If not, I don't understand nothing. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=281.0s)]
*  Oh, really? I'm trying to do the same with my daughter, man, because again, we have one year living here in Vegas. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=284.0s)]
*  And my my daughter, she's she's eight years. Oh, nice. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=290.0s)]
*  Congrats. She went to school last year. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=295.0s)]
*  Obviously, this the pandemic was here and everything. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=298.0s)]
*  But she started to go to school and I can see the more confidence when she tried to speak English. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=301.0s)]
*  Really? Yeah. And I thought I thought with her before. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=307.0s)]
*  I hate in the moment when I can see you can speak good English. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=312.0s)]
*  You need to stop the English in the house. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=316.0s)]
*  I don't want to hear any English word here because they're Spanish in the house. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=319.0s)]
*  Man, it's more opportunities. You know, it's your language is your culture. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=327.0s)]
*  I mean, she she she born in in in Hamlet in California. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=331.0s)]
*  Yeah. But lives all but seven years living living in Tijuana. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=336.0s)]
*  Wow. And she's she's Mexican. Oh, she's Mexican, man. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=341.0s)]
*  Yeah, dude. But we're glad to have her over here even for a year, man. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=344.0s)]
*  Do you now that you like really have become like you've really become such a star, you know, in a lot of ways, a lot of people. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=349.0s)]
*  People love you. I was at a I was at a I was talking with someone about you about the fights [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=357.0s)]
*  and they just gone to your last fight, which was in it was in California, right? [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=365.0s)]
*  It was in. Yeah. And they said when you came out, it was the loudest they'd ever that they'd heard since Conor McGregor. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=369.0s)]
*  Man, that's awesome. I mean, that's crazy. You're like the Mexican corner. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=377.0s)]
*  Thank you. So I feel like the people can connect a better with my history. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=382.0s)]
*  Oh, with your history. You know, yeah. I mean, with you, with my with my the way I am with the people. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=391.0s)]
*  And I don't know, I always say the same. But for example, the history of how this guy undefeated and amazing, like a wrestling god and everything. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=400.0s)]
*  Right. An amazing and perfect record. But I mean, my history is more like the history of the people. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=411.0s)]
*  Yeah. When you fall and you come back and you come back. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=418.0s)]
*  Yeah. And that's like the people can identify more that history on by himself than other ones like, hey, I mean, it's the same. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=423.0s)]
*  I won every time. Yeah. As opposed to I've lost and won and lost and won. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=431.0s)]
*  And obviously, I mean, I'm just trying to be happy and enjoy my job and, you know, be very kind with the people. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=436.0s)]
*  And that's it. It's crazy how I can connect with the people because I don't need to to say stupid things in the social media or the trash talk or something like that. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=445.0s)]
*  Yeah, I love it because I hate that. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=455.0s)]
*  Like to me, it's very boring when the when some guy tried to trash talk to do the trash talk in social media on the press conference. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=457.0s)]
*  Like, man, I saw that before. Like, right. Nothing new. It's not you. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=466.0s)]
*  It's not you. And it doesn't. Well, I guess it doesn't fit you. Some guys, it fits. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=470.0s)]
*  Yeah. Some guys can trash talk and it just fits their character. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=473.0s)]
*  But I don't know if it probably wouldn't fit your character. You don't think? [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=477.0s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, I said and I say this like, I mean, if you watch me mad in some place in a press conference with some with somebody is because I'm really mad with the guys. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=481.0s)]
*  Right. Right. Right. Yeah. You're not faking it. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=492.0s)]
*  Do you go is it is it because Tijuana is a third world country or Mexico is a third world country. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=495.0s)]
*  Is it scary to go back to Tijuana? Do you get scared since you're more popular now? Is it do you have any more fear? [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=501.0s)]
*  Is that it's a good question, man. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=506.0s)]
*  And nothing against the Mexican people. No, no, no, no. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=511.0s)]
*  I mean, I'm very open with when we talk about Tijuana because I know they're good and the bad things, man. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=514.0s)]
*  I mean, I love I love Tijuana. I love the city. I love my Mexico, the country. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=519.0s)]
*  We have an amazing things, the culture, the tradition, the food, my goodness, the food, man, the ladies, the people, whatever you want. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=524.0s)]
*  The avocados. What? The avocados. Avocados. I love avocado. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=531.0s)]
*  Oh, brother, brother, brother. The green gold. I love them. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=536.0s)]
*  But at the same time, I understand the bad things, the narco traffic, the violence. It's dangerous. It's a dangerous place. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=540.0s)]
*  I understand that. But I miss when I go to Mexico, I'm not really a scare, man, because I live there all my life. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=547.0s)]
*  Twenty twenty seven years I've been there, like getting an amazing time there, training, meeting people and everything. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=556.0s)]
*  Sometimes I think about maybe my family. You never, you never know. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=565.0s)]
*  Right. That is more scared for me to me, like, you know, because right now, right now I'm living in Vegas. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=571.0s)]
*  But my parents live in Tijuana. My brothers lives in Tijuana. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=578.0s)]
*  You know, my nephew kidnapping people, take people there sometimes. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=583.0s)]
*  So, for example, when some channel asked me for an interview for my father, like, I don't I don't like to get involved in all of this because I'll put them in this. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=586.0s)]
*  Exactly. Could be dangerous. Maybe you never know. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=600.0s)]
*  And so I prefer to put everything out of the conversation and just be me. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=604.0s)]
*  If you want to interview and get an interview for me, I can do it. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=609.0s)]
*  But even with that, I mean, they had a few interviews. Yeah. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=612.0s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. Do they do you did you ever get approached by like any drug people or anything after you become like a real success? [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=617.0s)]
*  Does does the cartel like come for you to like get you to be their guy or anything? [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=628.0s)]
*  Oh, man. I mean, no. Thanks God. Yeah. Because people like, I know Julio Cesar Chavez. Yeah. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=632.0s)]
*  He got approached by them. He talked about histories like men. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=639.0s)]
*  So the narco trafficking came with me, you know, because they love boxing too. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=644.0s)]
*  And they start to come with me and hey, Congress champs. And that's dangerous. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=649.0s)]
*  And actually, that's why Julio Cesar Chavez start to involve with the drugs and everything and start to have problems with that. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=654.0s)]
*  But you don't see that for now. Not right now. And I'm so happy. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=661.0s)]
*  I'm glad, you know. Yeah. And at the same time, I mean, I think I'm very smart in that area. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=664.0s)]
*  I don't smoke nothing. I don't eat nothing bad. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=671.0s)]
*  Like, you know, I don't drink alcohol or smoke cigars and never in my life. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=674.0s)]
*  So really, I feel like very, very smart in that area. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=678.0s)]
*  I had a really nice people around me in all my life to touch, teach me a really good things about all of the success. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=683.0s)]

*  So, yeah, I don't have too much time for my kids because when I finish my day, I try to go to my house and spend some time with my family. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=882.0s)]
*  But obviously, I'm so tired. I'm hungry or maybe I'm I'm diet because I have the fight. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=890.0s)]

*  Was it like that? Or what was it like? [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=938.0s)]

*  Yeah. OK, don't say that in Mexico, please, because that is serious. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=965.0s)]

*  Yeah. So yeah. But man, when I was a kid and I was growing up there in Tijuana, I was I was like going to the school and then going to the gym. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=971.0s)]
*  I had, you know, a few friends, but I never like every single weekend going to the nightclub or something like that. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=981.0s)]
*  I was like just being myself, going to the gym, to the school and doing my stuff. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=989.0s)]
*  And so I never find real problems. That's why. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=994.0s)]
*  That's why when a lot of people ask me like, hey, it's really dangerous. Yeah. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=997.0s)]
*  I'm not the guy. Yeah. Somebody else is. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=1002.0s)]
*  And they need to get more like big people to Mexico. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=1005.0s)]

*  Wow. That's why all the famous Mexican boxers are in the small weights. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=1049.0s)]

*  really to, you know, it's just you guys right there. [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=1739.52s)]
*  Does your goals shift now? [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=1742.92s)]
*  Like, do you have a different goal? [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=1744.3200000000002s)]
*  Do you have a different goal than maybe you did [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=1746.92s)]
*  two years ago? [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=1749.04s)]
*  And if so, what is it? [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=1751.0s)]
*  Because... [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=1752.24s)]
*  I mean, my goal is to be the best. [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=1754.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=1757.08s)]
*  You know? [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=1757.92s)]
*  And if I have the belt, [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=1758.76s)]
*  the people can recognize who is the best. [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=1761.32s)]
*  Oh, I see. [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=1763.04s)]
*  But to me, yeah, I mean, it's easy to me. [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=1764.28s)]
*  It's not the belt. [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=1768.0s)]
*  It's just why I have that belt. [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=1770.64s)]
*  You understand that? [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=1773.4s)]
*  Because... [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=1774.52s)]
*  Tell me more about it. [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=1775.92s)]
*  I can see a lot of like champions [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=1776.76s)]
*  and it's fine. [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=1779.6000000000001s)]
*  I mean, I don't have nothing against those guys. [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=1780.44s)]
*  I mean, it's fine. [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=1784.24s)]
*  I understand because they feel very proud. [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=1785.56s)]
*  But a lot of champions, like they won the title [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=1787.96s)]
*  and it's like, oh, I want to take pictures [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=1790.72s)]
*  every single day with my belt. [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=1793.3200000000002s)]
*  And I go to every single interview with the belt. [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=1795.0800000000002s)]
*  You know? [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=1798.72s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, dude. [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=1799.56s)]
*  Yeah, I feel you. [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=1800.4s)]
*  That's not your style. [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=1801.24s)]
*  Because they love the people sometimes, [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=1802.0800000000002s)]
*  they love like souvenirs. [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=1804.1200000000001s)]
*  They love trophies and... [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=1805.68s)]
*  Yeah, that's true. [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=1807.16s)]
*  I mean, to me, it's funny [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=1808.32s)]
*  because I remember when I won the belt, [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=1810.56s)]
*  well, okay, I have the belt, it's nice, it's pretty. [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=1813.6399999999999s)]
*  But I went to my house, [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=1816.44s)]
*  like I live in my couch like there. [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=1817.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=1819.56s)]
*  And then my wife came with me and said like, [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=1822.3999999999999s)]
*  hey, you need to put the belt in a nice place, come on. [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=1824.2s)]
*  Oh, I thought she'd be yelling at you, [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=1828.32s)]
*  like get your belt out the living room, you know? [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=1829.8s)]
*  Like get your shoes off the floor. [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=1832.36s)]
*  Yeah, I can do it later. [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=1834.12s)]
*  It's heavy too, the belt. [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=1836.52s)]
*  Oh, it's heavy. [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=1837.72s)]
*  Jesus Christ, give them a lighter belt [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=1838.56s)]
*  because you just fought the whole time, [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=1840.44s)]
*  now you gotta carry this heavy belt out of the room. [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=1842.0s)]
*  Man, imagine that, I mean, the people, [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=1843.84s)]
*  because sometimes I need to go with some sponsor [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=1845.64s)]
*  to do something, and they want to bring the belt. [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=1850.68s)]
*  Like, ah, fuck. [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=1853.0s)]
*  That's a six round right there. [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=1854.44s)]
*  Or they want the footer shoe with the belt, [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=1857.16s)]
*  and the belt is so heavy. [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=1859.8s)]
*  Like man, I don't like this thing. [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=1861.3600000000001s)]
*  You want the belt, take it. [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=1864.04s)]
*  I don't care. [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=1865.6000000000001s)]
*  Well, I mean. [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=1867.36s)]
*  So for what is the goal still, [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=1869.0s)]
*  because if you have the belt, [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=1870.76s)]
*  then people know who the champion is. [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=1872.36s)]
*  Yeah, that's it. [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=1873.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=1874.76s)]
*  You know? [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=1875.6s)]
*  And I'm always asking the same [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=1876.44s)]
*  because if the people ask me like, [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=1878.56s)]
*  hey, where's your belt? [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=1880.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=1881.6s)]
*  First of all, I'm not with the belt all the time. [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=1882.72s)]
*  I'm not with the belt in my car. [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=1886.04s)]
*  And second one, I mean, in that moment, [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=1888.4s)]
*  with belt or without belt, [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=1891.76s)]
*  you know who is the champion, right? [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=1894.76s)]
*  Oh yes, that's it. [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=1896.4s)]
*  But once you become a champion, [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=1898.4s)]
*  don't you feel like at a certain point, [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=1899.68s)]
*  you're qualified to always be a champion though? [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=1901.28s)]
*  I work like a champion every day, at least. [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=1904.32s)]
*  That's a good attitude. [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=1906.72s)]
*  That's a good point. [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=1907.56s)]
*  You know? [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=1908.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=1909.36s)]
*  Because sometimes talking about me in person, [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=1910.2s)]
*  I mean, I'm very obsessive. [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=1915.24s)]
*  Are you? [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=1917.36s)]
*  I feel like sometimes it's not enough. [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=1918.2s)]
*  Even when I know I'm working so hard [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=1920.52s)]
*  and I feel so tired, [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=1923.32s)]
*  I go to my bed thinking like, [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=1925.44s)]
*  ah, maybe I need to work a little bit more. [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=1926.8s)]
*  Actually, the success people work so hard [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=1930.1200000000001s)]
*  and they think they don't work so hard. [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=1934.16s)]
*  Oh, they don't think they work so hard. [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=1937.04s)]
*  That's interesting. [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=1938.48s)]
*  And that's, at the same time, [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=1939.48s)]
*  obviously the depression and everything, [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=1942.4s)]
*  you need to work with that, with your mind [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=1944.28s)]
*  because this is an important thing. [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=1945.56s)]
*  More in this sport because you live always [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=1948.4s)]
*  with a lot of stress and, you know? [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=1950.44s)]
*  Yeah, it's interesting. [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=1953.56s)]
*  I think I work all the time [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=1954.64s)]
*  and other people are like, man, you work so hard. [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=1956.16s)]
*  You're doing so well. [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=1958.3600000000001s)]
*  But me, I don't really see it like that. [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=1959.3200000000002s)]
*  Man, yes, man. [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=1961.2s)]
*  Sometimes a lot of people say to me, [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=1962.88s)]
*  hey, you need to rest. [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=1964.16s)]
*  Man, I don't know what you're talking about. [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=1965.76s)]
*  I mean, I need to do more. [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=1968.3600000000001s)]
*  But at the same time, I would say like, no, you can't. [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=1970.6000000000001s)]
*  I have this battlefield in my mind always. [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=1973.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=1976.8400000000001s)]
*  It's tough to manage sometimes. [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=1977.92s)]
*  I bet at least having a family and stuff [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=1979.8400000000001s)]
*  gets you out of your own head and keeps you there. [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=1981.64s)]
*  Of course. [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=1983.0s)]
*  I mean, I was talking with you about my time with my family [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=1984.6s)]
*  after practice, after my days finished my day. [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=1987.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=1991.56s)]
*  I know maybe the time is not the best because I'm tired [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=1993.6799999999998s)]
*  and I can't play like two hours with my daughters. [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=1998.48s)]
*  Oh, you have bad energy, you have neck brace. [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=2002.04s)]
*  You can't even do nothing. [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=2003.84s)]
*  At least I'm trying. [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=2004.9199999999998s)]
*  And you know, I spend time with my family. [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=2006.1599999999999s)]
*  It's nice, you know, because my daughters are there. [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=2007.8s)]
*  They're very funny. [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=2010.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=2010.9599999999998s)]
*  My big daughter, she's like, she's doing like... [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=2011.8s)]
*  The eight year old? [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=2014.24s)]
*  She's in the school, yeah. [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=2015.08s)]
*  And she's doing our UG2. [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=2016.32s)]
*  She is? [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=2019.08s)]
*  Yeah, and she's a one strip degree. [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=2020.12s)]
*  Oh, she's one stripe? [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=2024.0s)]
*  She's a white belt, one stripe. [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=2025.12s)]
*  Oh, same level. [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=2026.96s)]
*  Yeah, same boy. [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=2028.3999999999999s)]
*  I'm one stripe white belt, man. [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=2030.04s)]
*  But I'm still, I go like five times a week, [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=2031.44s)]
*  but I'm one stripe white belt right now. [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=2033.44s)]
*  Yeah, man, I mean, but that time with my family [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=2034.76s)]
*  distracts me to my realities. [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=2038.12s)]
*  We actually have a question. [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=2040.96s)]
*  We got some questions that came in [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=2042.76s)]
*  and usually we have television monitors, [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=2044.1200000000001s)]
*  but since we're not at the studio, [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=2045.88s)]
*  I'm just gonna have to play it like this. [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=2047.24s)]
*  And it's actually kind of about [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=2049.8s)]
*  what you're talking about and then... [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=2051.28s)]
*  Hi, Brandon and Theo, my name is Melissa. [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=2055.04s)]
*  So I am Mexican too. [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=2057.48s)]
*  Theo, at this point, I think you count as Mexican as well. [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=2059.28s)]
*  So I grew up in a very Mexican household. [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=2063.0s)]
*  Very traditional. [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=2065.92s)]
*  Women hold this nurturing, caregiving role. [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=2067.84s)]
*  And within recent years, I've really got into, you know, [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=2071.48s)]
*  MMA fighting following UFC, [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=2074.44s)]
*  and I'm interested in taking some jiu-jitsu classes. [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=2076.4s)]
*  I have a lot of friends that are males [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=2079.32s)]
*  that are taking classes right now. [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=2080.92s)]
*  So my question to Brandon is, [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=2082.5600000000004s)]
*  how do we eliminate these cultural barriers? [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=2084.6400000000003s)]
*  So if your daughter were to be interested [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=2087.32s)]
*  in maybe boxing, MMA fighting, [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=2089.0s)]
*  I'm interested in seeing your perspective [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=2092.0s)]
*  and how you would, you know, just go about that. [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=2093.96s)]
*  Again, thank you so much. [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=2097.8s)]
*  Saludos. [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=2099.04s)]
*  Saludos. [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=2100.8s)]
*  Saludos, that's a good question. [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=2101.64s)]
*  It fits, yeah. [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=2102.92s)]
*  So is it, and she may be talking specifically in Mexico [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=2103.76s)]
*  that women are looked at more of like a mother [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=2106.96s)]
*  and caregiver. [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=2108.92s)]
*  Do you think that that it's changing? [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=2110.16s)]
*  What do you think? [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=2114.16s)]
*  Or what do you think about women [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=2115.4s)]
*  in getting into jiu-jitsu in that country? [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=2116.36s)]
*  Man, I mean, first of all, [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=2118.7200000000003s)]
*  I feel a lot of respect for all women [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=2121.4s)]
*  who's trying to do this sport, man. [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=2123.32s)]
*  Because it's a tough sport, not just for a woman, [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=2126.0s)]
*  even for a man, it's a tough sport [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=2129.2000000000003s)]
*  because you need to learn too much. [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=2131.2000000000003s)]
*  And if you really want to be a fighter, [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=2132.76s)]
*  you need to pass for a lot of pain, man. [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=2136.2400000000002s)]
*  Yeah, it's scary. [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=2138.28s)]
*  I mean, because sometimes the people [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=2139.36s)]
*  is a little bit confused. [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=2141.6400000000003s)]
*  Like, oh, I don't wanna do mix martial arts, [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=2143.1600000000003s)]
*  but it looks very aggressive. [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=2145.1200000000003s)]
*  I mean, if you want just to do the sport [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=2146.32s)]
*  and practice and sweat and do some exercise, [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=2149.48s)]
*  you can do it. [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=2152.84s)]
*  I mean, you can hit paths, you can learn technique. [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=2153.6800000000003s)]
*  And that said, I mean, everything changes [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=2157.1600000000003s)]
*  when you wanna be a fighter definitely [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=2159.2400000000002s)]
*  because you need to do this part [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=2161.2000000000003s)]
*  and you need to have the hard sessions and everything. [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=2162.88s)]
*  And for a woman, when you step into a gym, [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=2168.2000000000003s)]
*  you can see, I don't know, 90% of the team, men. [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=2176.6000000000004s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=2183.28s)]
*  And maybe a few women there. [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=2185.0800000000004s)]
*  And that- [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=2188.1200000000003s)]
*  And a few men. [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=2189.32s)]
*  I can just imagine that is like a little bit- [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=2190.28s)]
*  Intimidation, huh? [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=2193.1200000000003s)]
*  Some intimidation there. [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=2194.48s)]
*  So starting from that, I have a lot of respect for her, [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=2196.0800000000004s)]
*  because it's hard, man. [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=2202.0800000000004s)]
*  So I don't know, I have the example of my daughter. [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=2204.44s)]
*  Like, hey girl, I mean, you need to go to do something [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=2208.7200000000003s)]
*  because you know, this self-defense, [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=2211.8399999999997s)]
*  it's a good weapon in your life. [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=2214.3599999999997s)]
*  You never know. [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=2215.7599999999998s)]
*  Oh yeah, even me just going, [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=2217.7599999999998s)]
*  I feel like now if somebody came and wanted to knock me out, [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=2219.2s)]
*  I wouldn't be as scared to get knocked out. [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=2222.04s)]
*  Whereas before I'd be scared to get knocked out. [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=2224.64s)]
*  But now at least if I, I'm just like, all right. [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=2226.9599999999996s)]
*  It's like a little less fear, I don't know. [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=2230.7599999999998s)]
*  Just little things. [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=2233.56s)]
*  Yeah, your confidence goes up. [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=2236.0s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, and she's a little princess, man. [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=2237.68s)]
*  I don't think like she wanna be like black belt, [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=2239.8s)]
*  a competitor. [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=2243.5600000000004s)]
*  I don't feel like she wanted to do that in the future. [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=2244.92s)]
*  But at least, I mean, get your blue belt, [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=2247.5600000000004s)]
*  get your purple belt and get that knowledge in your mind [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=2249.88s)]
*  and that's it, you know? [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=2253.28s)]
*  So do you think, what about in Mexico? [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=2255.44s)]
*  Is it getting popular for women there [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=2257.2400000000002s)]
*  or is it not that big of a thing there? [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=2258.8s)]
*  Or in Tijuana, you know? [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=2260.6800000000003s)]
*  I mean, right now in Entrant Gym in Tijuana, [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=2261.92s)]
*  they have a decent female team. [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=2265.36s)]
*  Oh wow, cool. [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=2268.8s)]
*  They have four or five girls. [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=2270.48s)]
*  I mean, it's not too much, right? [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=2271.3199999999997s)]
*  Because the team, the whole team is like 40, 50 guys. [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=2272.3199999999997s)]
*  Wow. [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=2279.6s)]
*  It's crazy. [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=2280.44s)]
*  What's the, there's a, predominantly it seems like Mexican [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=2281.2799999999997s)]
*  or Latino, like, it's like UFC or Bellator, [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=2287.52s)]
*  but it's at nighttime. [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=2293.44s)]
*  I see it on television sometimes. [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=2294.2799999999997s)]
*  You know what I'm talking about? [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=2295.44s)]
*  It's like a league. [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=2296.3199999999997s)]
*  It's like a fight league. [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=2297.7599999999998s)]
*  But it's mostly, I think, Mexican. [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=2300.36s)]
*  It's a smaller one. [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=2303.76s)]
*  It's like a Bellator, but it's very small, you know? [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=2304.6s)]
*  Sometimes I'm seeing it on TV. [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=2307.32s)]
*  Where do you see it? [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=2308.4s)]
*  At night, on television at night. [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=2309.2400000000002s)]
*  Sometimes late at night I see it. [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=2310.2400000000002s)]
*  I mean, they have a few ones like, it's a UWC. [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=2311.44s)]
*  Actually that league is from- [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=2316.32s)]
*  UWC, you were in it. [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=2318.16s)]
*  I fought there before. [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=2319.56s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=2320.76s)]
*  When I'm start fighting, like a professional, [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=2321.6s)]
*  I fought there. [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=2323.32s)]
*  And the league is from Entrant Gym, Tijuana. [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=2324.56s)]
*  It's a nice league because they put a lot of guys [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=2330.2400000000002s)]
*  in the Contender Series and a lot of guys got the contract [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=2332.2400000000002s)]
*  from Contender Series and fought in the UFC. [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=2335.56s)]

*  One of his things was the capoeira. [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=3269.3s)]
*  His style was capoeira. [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=3270.14s)]
*  So I love the style for that. [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=3272.42s)]

*  to do capoeira, but we find the mixed martial arts. [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=3277.82s)]

*  And they sign you up? [[00:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=3341.7400000000002s)]
*  That was a weekend, a Saturday, Sunday, [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=3342.9s)]
*  and next Monday I went to the class. [[00:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=3344.7s)]
*  And you stayed committed, huh? [[00:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=3346.1s)]

*  Right. [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=3350.1s)]
*  My style was very simple, it was like that. [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=3350.94s)]
*  And then, I mean, I was just training [[00:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=3353.34s)]
*  because I love to spend time there in the gym, [[00:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=3355.9s)]
*  sweating, doing exercise, my body looks better, right? [[00:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=3359.34s)]
*  Yeah, it's confidence. [[00:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=3363.38s)]
*  More confidence in the middle school, [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=3364.82s)]
*  you start to meet some girls, [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=3366.38s)]
*  and you start, you want to look better for that. [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=3368.02s)]
*  La la la la la bamba. [[00:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=3370.7400000000002s)]

*  But then, I mean, I started to watch like, [[00:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=3379.7000000000003s)]
*  man, I like to do this, like, I don't wanna do nothing more. [[00:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=3381.7400000000002s)]
*  But did people just look at you like a karate boy, [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=3384.7000000000003s)]
*  they're like, oh, it's just a karate boy? [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=3387.2200000000003s)]
*  Ah, maybe. [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=3388.82s)]
*  And then later it became a bigger thing for you. [[00:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=3390.7400000000002s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=3392.82s)]
*  And was there a point where you were thinking [[00:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=3393.6200000000003s)]
*  about not doing it anymore at some point? [[00:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=3395.1800000000003s)]
*  Like what? [[00:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=3397.2200000000003s)]
*  Like where you think when your career was kind of, [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=3398.0600000000004s)]
*  because your career has been like this, [[00:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=3399.94s)]
*  and it's definitely very, it's in a new space, [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=3401.7400000000002s)]
*  and has been for a few years now, [[00:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=3405.7000000000003s)]
*  but did you think when it was, did you reconsider? [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=3406.94s)]
*  Or not reconsider, but think maybe I'm finished? [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=3410.6200000000003s)]
*  A lot of times, man. [[00:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=3412.94s)]
*  That is a normal question in a life of a fighter. [[00:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=3414.46s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=3418.5400000000004s)]
*  I'm good on this, like, [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=3419.38s)]
*  I remember when I started my professional career, [[00:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=3423.54s)]
*  my amateur career was amazing. [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=3426.22s)]
*  Like a lot of the Brazilian Jiu Jitsu tournaments, winning. [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=3428.8599999999997s)]
*  I had a nice amateur record of kickboxing. [[00:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=3433.3399999999997s)]
*  I have 12 and two, something like that. [[00:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=3436.46s)]
*  My MMA amateur career was very nice too, [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=3438.9399999999996s)]
*  like six and an hour, I have one draw, something like that. [[00:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=3443.98s)]
*  But my amateur career was a success. [[00:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=3447.7799999999997s)]
*  But when I did my transition to the professional, [[00:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=3451.18s)]
*  I was like winning one, losing another one, winning one. [[00:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=3456.54s)]
*  My record went to three and three. [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=3460.02s)]
*  And the problem was I was very young. [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=3466.14s)]
*  I remember my- [[00:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=3469.14s)]
*  Damn, three and three, boy, anything could happen. [[00:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=3469.98s)]
*  You might not make the playoffs, you know? [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=3472.2999999999997s)]
*  Man, my first fight was when I had 17 years old. [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=3474.5s)]
*  And man, if you can watch me now, [[00:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=3482.14s)]
*  I mean, I know I'm not the most muscular guy [[00:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=3485.14s)]
*  in the room right now. [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=3488.1s)]
*  I'm not gonna fight you, I know that. [[00:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=3489.8599999999997s)]
*  I promise you. [[00:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=3492.06s)]
*  I promise you. [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=3493.06s)]
*  Imagine at 17 years old, I was like skinny. [[00:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=3494.8599999999997s)]
*  Really? [[00:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=3498.46s)]
*  No tattoos, like I was, looks like a kid, man. [[00:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=3499.2999999999997s)]
*  Like a kid. [[00:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=3502.5s)]
*  So my opponents, the most part of the time [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=3504.58s)]
*  was like bigger guys, like 20 something. [[00:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=3507.9s)]
*  I remember my first fight, the other guy had like 25, 27. [[00:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=3511.42s)]
*  Damn. [[00:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=3516.82s)]
*  Something like that, around that. [[00:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=3517.6600000000003s)]
*  And how old was you? [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=3518.5s)]
*  17. [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=3520.26s)]
*  Jesus Christ, that's illegal, I think. [[00:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=3521.1s)]
*  Yeah, so for example, at that fight I won. [[00:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=3522.7400000000002s)]
*  The next one, I fought with some guy. [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=3526.26s)]
*  He has like 21 or 22, but the guy was a guy [[00:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=3530.38s)]
*  who was working in construction and everything. [[00:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=3536.2200000000003s)]
*  Strong, big. [[00:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=3540.58s)]
*  And I was very frustrated because I remember saying to me, [[00:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=3542.1400000000003s)]
*  I know like talking about technique, I'm a huge better. [[00:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=3546.86s)]
*  Better than this guy. [[00:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=3552.7000000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=3553.62s)]
*  Right. [[00:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=3554.46s)]
*  The problem is I don't have the power to show it, right? [[00:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=3555.3s)]
*  Right. [[00:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=3557.1800000000003s)]

*  I would agree that I don't know if he won. [[01:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=4108.099999999999s)]
*  Okay. [[01:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=4111.38s)]
*  You know- [[01:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=4113.9s)]
*  I don't think that he, I don't believe [[01:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=4115.7s)]
*  that he did enough to win. [[01:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=4117.099999999999s)]
*  That's where I stand with it. [[01:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=4118.74s)]
*  Man, so I'm just trying to keep a balance between, [[01:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=4121.34s)]
*  I saw the fight, I feel like I won the fight, [[01:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=4126.9s)]
*  and I want to be very positive about it. [[01:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=4131.82s)]
*  And at the same time, I don't want to be cocky. [[01:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=4135.299999999999s)]
*  Right. [[01:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=4138.139999999999s)]
*  And say like, oh, I won the fight. [[01:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=4138.98s)]
*  I don't need to learn nothing about it because I won. [[01:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=4140.62s)]
*  And I don't want to be that stupid guy. [[01:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=4143.179999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=4145.9s)]
*  Okay. [[01:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=4146.74s)]
*  Because that guy's not learning anything. [[01:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=4147.58s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=4148.42s)]
*  So, man, I'm trying to watch the perspective of the judges [[01:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=4149.7s)]
*  to see what they can maybe watch in that fight. [[01:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=4154.219999999999s)]
*  And, you know, fix my mistakes. [[01:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=4159.7s)]
*  And that's it. [[01:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=4161.900000000001s)]
*  I mean, I know for sure. [[01:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=4162.740000000001s)]
*  I just need to fix a little things. [[01:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=4164.66s)]
*  Well, it's also interesting, [[01:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=4167.66s)]
*  and I heard you say this on another podcast, [[01:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=4168.9400000000005s)]
*  talking about the perspective of the judges, [[01:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=4170.5s)]
*  because some of them don't know that much about wrestling, [[01:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=4172.54s)]
*  about doing MMA. [[01:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=4175.46s)]
*  They don't, I don't even know. [[01:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=4177.58s)]
*  Some of them, I don't even know what business they're in. [[01:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=4179.54s)]
*  Man, that's important, man. [[01:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=4181.9800000000005s)]
*  I mean, a lot of guys from boxing, [[01:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=4183.26s)]
*  because they are a little bit old, [[01:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=4186.06s)]
*  like judging on a whole different sport, right? [[01:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=4188.82s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[01:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=4193.9s)]
*  Well, you don't notice sometimes, [[01:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=4194.74s)]
*  like, yeah, position is so important. [[01:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=4195.62s)]
*  One certain, like, hook of the foot [[01:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=4197.62s)]
*  or keeping an arm out of the way, [[01:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=4199.9400000000005s)]
*  like things like that are so strategic [[01:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=4202.06s)]
*  and that can shape around, it seems like. [[01:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=4203.86s)]
*  My point was, I mean, is, [[01:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=4205.9400000000005s)]
*  the guy throw three good punches in all the fight. [[01:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=4210.58s)]
*  He got three knockdowns against me, [[01:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=4216.0599999999995s)]
*  and he was throwing a good kicks. [[01:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=4219.22s)]
*  He tried a few takedowns in the fight. [[01:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=4220.94s)]
*  He never take me down really. [[01:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=4224.66s)]
*  He take me down one time, [[01:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=4226.14s)]
*  but it was my fault because I close too much distance [[01:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=4228.26s)]
*  and just take the, he just took the advantage [[01:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=4230.26s)]
*  and he did it, okay? [[01:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=4232.34s)]
*  That's my point, but my point is, man, [[01:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=4233.9s)]
*  I was touching his face every single time. [[01:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=4236.38s)]
*  Bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam. [[01:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=4239.74s)]
*  You know? [[01:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=4242.54s)]
*  Damn, like a musician, huh? [[01:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=4243.38s)]
*  Like Tommy Lee. [[01:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=4245.38s)]
*  Man, I know I don't have enough power [[01:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=4246.22s)]
*  to knock a guy like cold, but I mean, I'm doing my job. [[01:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=4249.660000000001s)]
*  Oh, you put him in the refrigerator. [[01:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=4253.660000000001s)]
*  Effective punches, straight to his face, everything. [[01:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=4255.700000000001s)]
*  Yeah, what else could you, look, [[01:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=4262.5s)]
*  I don't think that the title should have changed hands, man. [[01:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=4264.1s)]
*  I really don't think that it should have. [[01:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=4266.9400000000005s)]
*  I wonder, sometimes you wonder [[01:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=4268.46s)]
*  if it's they're doing something because of the story. [[01:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=4270.58s)]
*  They want this bigger picture story. [[01:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=4273.74s)]
*  But you know what? [[01:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=4275.74s)]
*  Actually, right now I'm very excited, man. [[01:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=4276.74s)]
*  Because I feel like I put a little bit more drama [[01:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=4280.34s)]
*  in all of this, and at the same time, [[01:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=4282.22s)]
*  I'm a little bit mad with me. [[01:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=4284.94s)]
*  Like, man, that belt is yours, man. [[01:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=4286.099999999999s)]
*  And now you wake up some monster inside of me, man. [[01:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=4288.22s)]
*  Yeah, I like that, huh? [[01:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=4292.46s)]
*  Some chupacabra. [[01:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=4293.86s)]
*  Some faggots chupacabras. [[01:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=4295.3s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[01:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=4296.62s)]
*  So man, I don't know, man. [[01:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=4300.46s)]
*  It is interesting. [[01:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=4302.38s)]
*  At least your story now has another, [[01:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=4303.22s)]
*  because that's your story. [[01:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=4305.26s)]
*  Your story is this. [[01:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=4306.82s)]
*  Yeah, it's a little bit closer, man. [[01:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=4308.42s)]
*  That's your story. [[01:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=4309.26s)]
*  It is. [[01:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=4310.1s)]
*  So it's almost like we can't be shocked [[01:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=4310.9400000000005s)]
*  when we get our story. [[01:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=4315.22s)]
*  We can't be surprised. [[01:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=4317.22s)]
*  It's like, that's what God has for us. [[01:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=4318.3s)]
*  He has that story. [[01:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=4320.02s)]
*  It's like, your story is that you are a guy [[01:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=4321.1s)]
*  who has to face certain adversities. [[01:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=4324.22s)]
*  Everybody is, and that's the way that yours goes. [[01:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=4326.46s)]
*  That's interesting, man. [[01:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=4328.9800000000005s)]
*  But yeah, I'm sure you have more, [[01:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=4330.06s)]
*  you certainly have more purpose. [[01:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=4333.1s)]
*  The guy coming wanting something always has more purpose. [[01:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=4333.9400000000005s)]
*  And you know what, man? [[01:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=4338.820000000001s)]
*  And it's exciting. [[01:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=4339.66s)]
*  It is exciting. [[01:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=4341.34s)]
*  You know what? [[01:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=4342.18s)]
*  I mean, I'm very honest with everybody about this. [[01:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=4343.02s)]
*  Like, I'm start this in a selfish way. [[01:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=4348.02s)]
*  Like, I'm start this because I wanna be the best. [[01:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=4353.3s)]
*  I wanna prove something to the world [[01:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=4356.62s)]
*  and I'm not enough good to be the best in this sport. [[01:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=4359.06s)]
*  Stupid things like I want a huge house. [[01:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=4366.780000000001s)]
*  I want a nice car. [[01:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=4368.820000000001s)]
*  Everything start from there, from the selfish way. [[01:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=4369.9800000000005s)]
*  But then- [[01:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=4373.660000000001s)]
*  For you? [[01:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=4374.5s)]
*  For me, exactly. [[01:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=4375.320000000001s)]
*  But then, you know, a lot of people start to come [[01:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=4376.160000000001s)]
*  to my journey, my wife, my daughters, my family. [[01:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=4380.38s)]
*  Then you start to watch. [[01:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=4384.780000000001s)]
*  If you do a nice job in this, [[01:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=4386.18s)]
*  you can do something for the mixed martial arts [[01:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=4389.38s)]
*  in all your country. [[01:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=4391.780000000001s)]
*  You are motivating a lot of kids around Mexico [[01:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=4393.42s)]
*  to do this sport who watch Brandon Moreno. [[01:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=4397.06s)]
*  Like, hey, I wanna be that guy. [[01:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=4400.02s)]
*  I wanna be Brandon Moreno. [[01:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=4401.62s)]
*  Imagine that, man. [[01:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=4402.46s)]
*  Even probably for Halloween, [[01:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=4404.26s)]
*  they had people that were Brandon Moreno. [[01:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=4405.34s)]
*  Now I can see, I can move the world, man. [[01:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=4407.22s)]
*  I can move. [[01:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=4410.9800000000005s)]
*  And that is a huge motivation for me, man. [[01:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=4411.820000000001s)]
*  That's a good point. [[01:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=4414.34s)]
*  It's powerful. [[01:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=4415.18s)]
*  Almost, I think it starts to become, [[01:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=4416.84s)]
*  for some guys in the all's business, [[01:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=4418.44s)]
*  I notice it with Dustin, I notice it with certain guys, [[01:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=4420.6s)]
*  you get to a level as a human [[01:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=4426.16s)]
*  where you can do it with or without the sport, even. [[01:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=4428.0s)]
*  I think, I'm not saying that now. [[01:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=4431.72s)]
*  I'm not saying, I just think, you know, [[01:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=4433.08s)]
*  sometimes you start to transcend. [[01:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=4435.28s)]
*  People see who you are as a human through the fighting. [[01:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=4437.5s)]
*  You know, and that's what's sometimes really [[01:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=4442.36s)]
*  what also people gravitate towards. [[01:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=4445.2s)]
*  Yeah, and you know, the people sometimes, they forget. [[01:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=4447.5199999999995s)]
*  I mean, I'm a human. [[01:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=4451.16s)]
*  I know how to fight. [[01:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=4453.2s)]
*  Right. [[01:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=4454.32s)]
*  That's a fact. [[01:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=4455.16s)]
*  But I'm a human being as you, as the other guys, right? [[01:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=4458.24s)]
*  And that, I think, is why the people get some motivation [[01:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=4465.72s)]
*  because I'm always very clear with everybody. [[01:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=4470.16s)]
*  Like, man, I'm born in Tijuana in a hood. [[01:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=4472.88s)]
*  You know, definitely I understand [[01:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=4479.2s)]
*  the opportunities of other people are different. [[01:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=4481.52s)]
*  Maybe I had better opportunities to other people [[01:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=4486.32s)]
*  who was trying to do this the same way. [[01:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=4488.92s)]
*  I understand a lot of people, [[01:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=4492.26s)]
*  they don't get the success in the future. [[01:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=4497.04s)]
*  Right. [[01:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=4499.84s)]
*  That's a fact. [[01:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=4500.84s)]
*  Right. [[01:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=4502.1s)]
*  Some people don't get the same success or the same future. [[01:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=4502.9400000000005s)]
*  Some people don't get the same opportunity. [[01:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=4505.1s)]
*  Some people get to live vicariously [[01:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=4507.200000000001s)]
*  through your opportunity. [[01:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=4508.9800000000005s)]
*  Sometimes there's a guy maybe who wanted to train [[01:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=4510.900000000001s)]
*  or wanted to do this or that. [[01:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=4513.900000000001s)]
*  It could be a guy that's in a wheelchair. [[01:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=4515.22s)]
*  It could be a guy that is just got his wife, [[01:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=4516.84s)]
*  his girlfriend pregnant young and had to start being. [[01:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=4520.3s)]
*  And they see you, it's like, it's almost like they, [[01:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=4523.38s)]
*  it's like, oh, that guy, whatever I, [[01:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=4525.860000000001s)]
*  what I wanted to have a chance at, he got a chance at. [[01:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=4529.46s)]
*  And they're not angry. [[01:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=4532.38s)]
*  They are just, they, I think can relate. [[01:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=4533.22s)]
*  Yeah, man. [[01:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=4536.82s)]
*  So, but man, at the end of the day, to me, [[01:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=4538.18s)]
*  it's about hard work. [[01:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=4541.96s)]
*  Okay. [[01:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=4546.14s)]
*  Obviously it's about decisions, [[01:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=4546.9800000000005s)]
*  about how you manage your life [[01:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=4548.86s)]
*  and the possibilities of your own world. [[01:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=4551.62s)]
*  But to me, it's hard work, man. [[01:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=4554.86s)]
*  I really believe if you live in this position [[01:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=4557.1s)]
*  with hard work, maybe you don't got to here, [[01:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=4562.9800000000005s)]
*  but man, you're here and your hard work putting here. [[01:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=4565.9400000000005s)]
*  Man, that is a success, man. [[01:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=4570.1s)]
*  Do you think that that comes to you from, [[01:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=4572.22s)]
*  is do you think that that is traditionally a Mexican trait [[01:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=4574.38s)]
*  or do you think that that is something that was learned [[01:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=4577.900000000001s)]
*  by your, instilled by your parents? [[01:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=4579.740000000001s)]
*  Or do you just feel like it's just who you are, kind of? [[01:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=4581.620000000001s)]
*  Is that Mexican? [[01:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=4585.34s)]
*  I started talking to Mexican people work fucking hard. [[01:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=4586.18s)]
*  Dog, I don't even know when Mexican people sleep. [[01:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=4588.42s)]
*  When I see Mexican people, [[01:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=4590.34s)]
*  Mexican people are the hardest. [[01:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=4591.860000000001s)]
*  I wake up every day and I go like this, [[01:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=4593.860000000001s)]
*  round of applause for Mexican people [[01:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=4595.740000000001s)]
*  for keeping the country going. [[01:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=4598.5s)]
*  They work hard. [[01:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=4600.22s)]
*  That's why, I mean, to me, it's this combination. [[01:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=4601.06s)]
*  It's hard work, your decisions, [[01:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=4602.780000000001s)]
*  and your world, your opportunities. [[01:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=4606.42s)]
*  Okay. [[01:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=4609.62s)]
*  Because yeah, it's obviously, [[01:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=4610.820000000001s)]
*  it's not just about the hard work. [[01:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=4612.9800000000005s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=4614.860000000001s)]
*  Because I know a lot of people who cross the border [[01:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=4616.54s)]
*  trying to get a better life for their family [[01:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=4618.139999999999s)]
*  and work all his life, but they never do nothing. [[01:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=4621.099999999999s)]
*  Like they don't save money or they don't, you know? [[01:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=4624.299999999999s)]
*  So that is about the decisions. [[01:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=4628.259999999999s)]
*  And another thing is, the opportunities around you. [[01:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=4630.7s)]
*  When you were growing up, [[01:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=4634.94s)]
*  did you know anybody that went and snuck all across the border? [[01:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=4635.78s)]
*  Did you know, were there people like that? [[01:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=4637.94s)]
*  Cause I'm sure that, or people that came, [[01:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=4639.82s)]
*  cause a lot of people sneak across, right? [[01:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=4644.58s)]
*  It's, I mean, that's just happens over the, you know, [[01:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=4646.34s)]
*  tons of people have done it over the years. [[01:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=4649.099999999999s)]
*  Do you ever, is that a popular thing [[01:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=4651.3s)]
*  where people go and then send money back? [[01:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=4652.78s)]
*  Cause you hear about it from here, [[01:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=4654.3s)]
*  but you don't, I don't know what it's like in Tijuana, [[01:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=4655.46s)]
*  you know? [[01:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=4657.34s)]
*  Hmm. [[01:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=4659.099999999999s)]
*  Man, I don't know. [[01:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=4661.54s)]
*  You never saw that world really much? [[01:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=4662.46s)]
*  Not exactly, no. [[01:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=4665.94s)]
*  In my, around my family, I mean, I had too much history. [[01:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=4666.78s)]
*  I have a family in Los Angeles, for example, [[01:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=4669.34s)]
*  and, but I'm not sure if they are legal or not. [[01:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=4674.66s)]
*  Right, right. [[01:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=4677.34s)]
*  I don't think half the people in Los Angeles [[01:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=4678.18s)]
*  know if they're legal or not. [[01:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=4680.5s)]
*  I think they're legal. [[01:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=4682.18s)]
*  I don't, I'm not sure to be. [[01:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=4683.38s)]
*  Right, right, yeah, who knows? [[01:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=4685.06s)]
*  So I don't know. [[01:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=4686.26s)]
*  I mean, before, cross the border was easy, man. [[01:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=4687.22s)]
*  You needed to say like, oh, I'm American citizen. [[01:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=4690.66s)]
*  You need to speak like a decent English, [[01:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=4692.860000000001s)]
*  and that's it, you can cross the border. [[01:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=4695.62s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[01:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=4696.9800000000005s)]
*  But then after the September 11, [[01:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=4697.82s)]
*  the borders, everything are very, very discipline borders. [[01:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=4702.58s)]
*  Right. [[01:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=4709.299999999999s)]
*  It's hard to cross the border. [[01:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=4710.139999999999s)]
*  You need to have your visa. [[01:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=4710.98s)]
*  The officers are very like watching everything. [[01:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=4712.259999999999s)]
*  You can't cross the border like easy as before. [[01:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=4716.78s)]
*  It's tighter, yeah. [[01:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=4720.179999999999s)]
*  And they have, and now they have people [[01:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=4721.54s)]
*  crossing the other way. [[01:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=4724.62s)]
*  That's the craziest thing to me, [[01:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=4725.74s)]
*  is that there's now people leaving America [[01:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=4728.42s)]
*  to go live in Mexico. [[01:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=4729.58s)]
*  Not that it's not a great thing to do, [[01:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=4730.78s)]
*  but it's just times change, you know? [[01:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=4733.42s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I can imagine, [[01:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=4735.82s)]
*  isn't the other border cities, [[01:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=4738.7s)]
*  like, you know, for example, [[01:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=4742.14s)]
*  the father of my wife, my wife's father's. [[01:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=4743.98s)]
*  Your father and your wife's dad. [[01:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=4747.7s)]
*  Uh-huh. [[01:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=4750.98s)]
*  Your stepdad. [[01:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=4751.82s)]
*  He lives, he do the same. [[01:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=4752.66s)]
*  Like he lives in Tamaulipas, [[01:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=4754.46s)]
*  but he work in Laredo. [[01:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=4756.94s)]
*  So it's the same. [[01:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=4759.0599999999995s)]
*  I wanna go to El Paso. [[01:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=4761.9s)]
*  You ever been there? [[01:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=4762.86s)]
*  Just, I passed there. [[01:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=4764.379999999999s)]

*  Yeah, I mean, UFC has a few projects in Mexico right now. [[01:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=4893.94s)]
*  We had like two or three years [[01:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=4899.54s)]
*  where the relation between UFC and Latin America [[01:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=4902.58s)]
*  was like not the best [[01:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=4907.179999999999s)]
*  because everything start with the first developer program [[01:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=4909.179999999999s)]
*  from UFC in Latin America. [[01:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=4914.42s)]
*  So they went to Mexico City [[01:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=4917.74s)]
*  and they make like trials for a lot of Latin fighters. [[01:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=4919.86s)]
*  Guys from Argentina, guys from Colombia, [[01:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=4925.3s)]

*  went to Mexico City [[01:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=4931.179999999999s)]

*  and they start doing like hitting pads, [[01:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=4936.74s)]
*  doing Yu-Gi-Oh! rolls with other guys, [[01:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=4940.179999999999s)]
*  showing all the skills. [[01:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=4943.179999999999s)]

*  Exactly. [[01:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=4947.179999999999s)]
*  And then UFC pick 12 fighters [[01:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=4948.219999999999s)]
*  to go to Albuquerque, New Mexico, [[01:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=4953.62s)]
*  to Jackson, San-Me-Me. [[01:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=4958.34s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=4959.18s)]
*  The UFC was paying everything, [[01:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=4960.0199999999995s)]
*  like paying the gym, paying the food [[01:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=4961.42s)]
*  to 12 fighters to develop the skills of the fighters, right? [[01:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=4963.7s)]
*  And did you have a chance to be in that or no? [[01:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=4969.42s)]
*  So that's the first generation of that developer program [[01:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=4970.98s)]
*  were 12 guys. [[01:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=4977.0199999999995s)]

*  Exactly. [[01:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=4987.9800000000005s)]
*  Leave six guys there in New Mexico, in Albuquerque [[01:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=4988.820000000001s)]

*  And that was you? [[01:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=4993.5s)]
*  And that was me. [[01:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=4994.34s)]
*  One of the guys was me. [[01:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=4995.18s)]
*  And they- [[01:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=4996.66s)]
*  And you lived together in a house? [[01:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=4998.1s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=4999.58s)]

*  You know, it wasn't a little. [[01:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=5002.22s)]
*  No, it was hard, man, to be honest. [[01:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=5004.18s)]
*  Oh, I bet. [[01:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=5006.42s)]

*  Oh, people snoring, everything. [[01:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=5009.22s)]
*  It wasn't a little apartment in the gym, [[01:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=5010.06s)]
*  living with 12 guys. [[01:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=5013.26s)]
*  Oh, Jesus Christ. [[01:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=5014.66s)]
*  Everybody was like this, like. [[01:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=5016.379999999999s)]
*  But I mean- [[01:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=5019.339999999999s)]
*  Choking each other, yeah? [[01:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=5020.179999999999s)]
*  I know. [[01:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=5021.259999999999s)]
*  I don't care, man. [[01:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=5022.46s)]
*  I was there to get new knowledge and get better [[01:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=5023.299999999999s)]
*  and train with other different people. [[01:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=5027.66s)]
*  So they did that program, [[01:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=5029.7s)]
*  do they still do a lot of programs like that? [[01:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=5030.78s)]
*  Or is it growing? [[01:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=5032.62s)]
*  I'm sure people just seeing you will help it grow. [[01:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=5033.62s)]
*  So that, with those guys from the developer program, [[01:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=5035.86s)]
*  they made the first, the ultimate final in Latin America. [[01:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=5041.86s)]
*  Okay. [[01:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=5047.219999999999s)]
*  Okay. [[01:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=5048.299999999999s)]
*  So everything started from there, [[01:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=5049.139999999999s)]
*  from that developer program and that, the ultimate fighter. [[01:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=5051.78s)]
*  They made two more seasons [[01:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=5055.74s)]
*  and they made two more developer programs. [[01:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=5059.299999999999s)]
*  So the other developer program was in American Top Thing [[01:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=5063.42s)]
*  and the last one was in Kings MMA in Los Angeles. [[01:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=5067.62s)]
*  So a lot of guys start to go to UFC, [[01:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=5072.62s)]
*  but then something happened. [[01:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=5076.94s)]
*  They stopped with the developer programs. [[01:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=5078.74s)]
*  They stopped with the ultimate fighter. [[01:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=5080.3s)]
*  And if you wanted to go to the UFC, [[01:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=5083.62s)]
*  was like, oh, I don't have nothing to show. [[01:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=5086.34s)]
*  Because it's not like the matchmaker is going [[01:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=5089.18s)]
*  to the Mexican promotions to watch the talent there. [[01:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=5092.099999999999s)]
*  I see, right. [[01:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=5095.18s)]
*  So there was no way to really be seen. [[01:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=5096.1s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=5097.780000000001s)]
*  So it was hard, but now with the title, [[01:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=5098.9800000000005s)]
*  I feel like the connection between UFC and Latin America [[01:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=5102.3s)]
*  start to work again. [[01:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=5108.22s)]
*  So last year after the title, [[01:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=5109.46s)]
*  a lot of guys from Anthem Gym, from a gym in Tijuana, [[01:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=5111.900000000001s)]
*  they went to the Contender Series. [[01:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=5116.22s)]
*  Oh, that's cool. [[01:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=5117.46s)]
*  Actually my manager was a really huge help for that too. [[01:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=5119.9400000000005s)]
*  So they fought the Contender Series. [[01:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=5123.34s)]
*  Everybody get the contract. [[01:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=5125.5s)]
*  And now they are Jib's fighters, man. [[01:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=5126.74s)]
*  That's awesome. [[01:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=5130.82s)]
*  And then the next Contender Series is coming. [[01:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=5131.78s)]
*  And for sure I know other guys from Anthem, from a gym, [[01:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=5135.86s)]
*  that are going to the Contender Series. [[01:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=5140.14s)]
*  So there's a huge connection. [[01:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=5142.02s)]
*  And Anthem Gym has a lot of different fighters [[01:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fJJK_gH_nM&t=5143.26s)]
