*  a... He's someone who served. He's someone who has protected and served to the best of his ability. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=150.16s)]

*  Yeah, I'm excited to learn about. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=209.16s)]
*  So you've worked as police police detective, detective and a narc. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=211.04s)]
*  I was in narcotics. No, you were in narc. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=218.68s)]
*  I was in narcotics for a while. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=220.52s)]
*  Dang, bro. Yeah, dude. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=221.92s)]
*  They would always accuse people of being narcs when I was young. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=224.32s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. Yeah, absolutely. It's 21 Jump Street. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=227.32s)]
*  Yeah. Oh, I remember one time like we went in the woods to smoke some weed [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=230.48s)]
*  or something, and like it was like where you put the pen to get the can [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=233.72s)]
*  and put the little holes in the can and then you put the weed on there. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=238.56s)]
*  Absolutely. And right when I went to like hit it, like I breathed out [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=241.36s)]
*  for some reason or like kind of sneer or like coughed and it blew all the weed [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=245.32s)]
*  out of the bowl and just onto the ground. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=250.2s)]
*  Absolutely. And people were like, you're a fucking narc. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=252.24s)]
*  You know, people call me a narc. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=255.2s)]
*  I think somebody. Yeah, I think somebody fucking hit me in the back. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=256.4s)]
*  But anyway, so so as an officer, we're going to get into like [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=259.2s)]
*  you've had a pretty crazy career. We're going to get into it as an officer. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=263.92s)]
*  Take me say if I go on or like a ride along with you, right? [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=266.88s)]
*  Your first week on the job, we go on a ride along when you are a cop. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=269.44s)]
*  OK, what's that like? [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=274.68s)]
*  You're saying that it was my first week on the job. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=277.84000000000003s)]
*  You're going to go to. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=279.8s)]
*  Yeah, I'm just trying to put myself like it right, like right there in the past. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=280.84000000000003s)]
*  OK, well, first off, first week of the job, the first time that they actually [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=283.64s)]
*  put you out in a car by yourself, you know, I was 21 years old. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=287.56s)]
*  So I remember driving out of the parking lot and, you know, [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=290.36s)]
*  getting ready to pull on that street. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=293.36s)]
*  I'm in full uniform. You know, I got a shotgun. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=294.88s)]
*  I got a gun. I got a police car. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=296.96s)]
*  They're basically going out, saying, go out and do what you got to do. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=299.12s)]
*  And I remember the feeling of it, just going, these people are fucking nuts. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=301.56s)]
*  You know, this is crazy. I'm 21 years old and, you know, I'm in this uniform [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=304.32s)]
*  and they're literally sending me out to to do what cops do. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=308.2s)]
*  So it takes a little bit. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=311.4s)]
*  I remember at the starting, it took it took a while to get to the job. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=313.6s)]
*  It took it took a while to get used to, you know, it's a tremendous amount of power. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=316.36s)]
*  Oh, I can't imagine that reminds me of even just when I got my first car [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=319.68s)]
*  and I'm driving off, I'm like, OK, I'm leaving home. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=322.92s)]
*  I'm just it's me out here. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=326.52000000000004s)]
*  I can't imagine if there's also weapons, weapons, shotguns, a whole whole crew [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=328.48s)]
*  guys out there with you, they're going to back up whatever it is you do. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=333.2s)]
*  You know, there's a it's pretty substantial for a young kid, especially at that age. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=335.84000000000003s)]
*  I can't even imagine. Yeah, too young. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=340.24s)]
*  Twenty one is too young. Yeah, my belief is 21 is too young. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=341.96000000000004s)]
*  I think I think there needs to be a little bit. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=344.56s)]
*  You need to be a little further in life, but, you know, [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=346.96s)]
*  they pull them as early as 21. Wow. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=349.84s)]
*  So you're rolling out there 21. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=352.32s)]
*  You got the guns, you got the weaponry, your crews. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=354.64s)]
*  And are you like, is there part of is it excitement to is it just fear? [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=357.35999999999996s)]
*  What is it? You know, there wasn't a lot of fear, a ton of adrenaline, ton of excitement. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=361.32s)]
*  You know, you've already gone through a long process. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=366.35999999999996s)]
*  The Academy, where you've been, you know, gone through a lot of training [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=368.35999999999996s)]
*  and seen a lot of scenarios and heard a lot of stories. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=371.84000000000003s)]
*  So, you know, when you first get out there and you get out on the streets, [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=375.0s)]
*  it's pure adrenaline. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=378.64s)]
*  I don't ever remember. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=380.12s)]
*  I don't ever remember being initially scared. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=381.48s)]
*  OK, fear wasn't really a factor. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=383.68s)]
*  It was just too big. The group was too big. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=386.72s)]
*  There was too much. I mean, you got a gun, for God's sake. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=389.0s)]
*  You know, you're going out on your own. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=390.8s)]
*  So what music do you listen to? [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=392.04s)]
*  Like, what song do you put on that? [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=394.28000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, you know, now, actually, none. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=395.56s)]
*  I didn't. When I got into narcotics, [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=398.56s)]
*  when we would go to search warrants, we would always all the guys would wear, [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=400.68s)]
*  you know, headsets on the way to the to the location. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=404.4s)]
*  We always listen to our own music. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=406.88s)]
*  I I listen to for scenarios like that. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=408.28s)]
*  I listen to Danzig, Mother. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=411.76s)]
*  I don't know why, but that was a big one for me. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=413.15999999999997s)]
*  Because it's children not to go my way. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=414.91999999999996s)]
*  Just the yeah, just the lick itself. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=418.0s)]
*  But I actually would listen to my generation. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=419.8s)]
*  I would listen to a lot of easy six in the morning. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=423.15999999999997s)]
*  Oh, yeah. You know, stuff like that. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=426.08s)]
*  So I'm like, I. Yeah. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=427.84s)]
*  Six in the morning, police at my door. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=430.56s)]
*  OK, so you're out there, someone you're rattling your first week. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=432.48s)]
*  What is it? Does it get kind of wild your first week? [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=435.0s)]
*  What's that like? No, it's just getting used to it. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=437.32s)]
*  You know, just kind of figure out how it's done. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=439.71999999999997s)]
*  Again, it's a tremendous amount of power and everything's new. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=441.4s)]
*  I mean, I can remember being 21 years old going to domestic violence calls [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=446.08s)]
*  and going. You haven't even had any domestic violence in your own life. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=450.0s)]
*  I didn't have a girlfriend. Yeah. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=452.92s)]
*  At that point, I didn't I didn't know anything about relationships, [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=454.15999999999997s)]
*  but you would go into these situations where people were in turmoil, you know, [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=456.56s)]
*  and there was real problems and they would look at you and go, [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=460.47999999999996s)]
*  what are you going to do? What are we going to do? [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=463.88s)]
*  And I remember thinking in my mind, like, well, I got no fucking clue. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=466.15999999999997s)]
*  You know, would you ever call your mom, be like, mom, what should I even do? [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=469.0s)]
*  No, I never called my mom. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=472.12s)]
*  I never call my mom. I was about to say, I probably should have. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=473.88s)]
*  But you just kind of wing it. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=476.12s)]
*  You know, it's it's really changed the way I look at everything. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=477.56s)]
*  Those scenarios, because there was a real expectation. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=480.2s)]
*  Like I knew what I was doing, especially being young. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=483.08s)]
*  They just because you're in that uniform, they think that you know [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=485.68s)]
*  what the next step is as far as solving the situation. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=487.88s)]
*  And you really don't for a long time. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=491.96000000000004s)]
*  You wing it, you know, within the law, there's all kinds of statues [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=493.96000000000004s)]
*  and laws that you all follow. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=497.0s)]
*  But when they start asking for advice or, you know, [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=498.36s)]
*  it's crazy, the expectation that you have a clear understanding [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=502.04s)]
*  of what to do in any given situation. Wow. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=505.40000000000003s)]
*  And the situations vary. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=507.84000000000003s)]
*  Yeah. So it must be crazy. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=509.36s)]
*  So like a lot of times you are when you encounter someone, they need [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=510.48s)]
*  they're having the worst day or it's there. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=515.36s)]
*  They need help. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=518.28s)]
*  It's like the look in their eyes. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=519.16s)]
*  It must always be one of like panic or fear or. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=520.76s)]
*  Yeah, generally, you're dealing with people's worst day, no matter what it was. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=524.32s)]
*  You're never going to a scenario where people are happy and things are going well. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=527.2s)]
*  It's always bad situations, even as simple as a ticket. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=530.2s)]
*  You know, for some people, a ticket is a humongous ordeal. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=532.84s)]
*  Oh, yeah, you get a ticket, dude. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=535.6800000000001s)]
*  I remember I got three tickets for I went to court for my first ticket. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=538.4s)]
*  So I got my first ticket. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=542.9200000000001s)]
*  I actually got my first ticket on the way to being sworn in in downtown L.A. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=544.84s)]
*  It's first time I ever drove in downtown L.A. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=548.64s)]
*  And I made an illegal U-turn and I'm getting a ticket. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=550.64s)]
*  Even showed the guy the paperwork saying I'm getting sworn in. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=553.2s)]
*  I'm one of you guys. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=555.4s)]
*  You still wrote me a ticket. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=557.2s)]
*  And we got to make those quotas. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=558.0s)]
*  That's what they say. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=559.88s)]
*  So tell me like one of the craziest things that kind of happened out of the gate, [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=561.96s)]
*  like something that's kind of wild. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=565.12s)]
*  The the first time I witnessed someone die. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=568.88s)]
*  Wow. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=573.08s)]
*  Which is in 20 years, there's been quite a few of those. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=573.6800000000001s)]
*  But the first one I ever watched was a I got a radio call. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=578.44s)]
*  I was very young. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=582.64s)]
*  I got a radio calls in the L.A. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=584.24s)]
*  area and it was with a subject with a gun. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=585.8000000000001s)]
*  And they gave us a description. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=589.1600000000001s)]
*  And when I pulled up to the location, it was like a like a waffle, [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=590.48s)]
*  not a waffle house, but like a chicken place or something. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=593.2800000000001s)]
*  And I saw the guys out front based on the description. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=596.0s)]
*  It was a kid wearing a red puffer jacket. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=598.44s)]
*  And as soon as I pulled up on the kid, he bolted. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=601.36s)]
*  So chase him a little bit with the car as long as I could. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=604.44s)]
*  Eventually, he started cutting through businesses and so on. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=608.08s)]
*  So I'd go on foot. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=610.84s)]
*  We had a foot pursuit that went on for a little bit. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=612.72s)]
*  I chased the guy through, you know, some parking lots and so [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=614.76s)]
*  such, and the kid ended up running into the street. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=618.2s)]
*  I believe it was it was right at Manchester and Gramercy. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=621.52s)]
*  And kid ran right out into the street without checking traffic. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=623.96s)]
*  And he got hit by a car. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=626.8000000000001s)]
*  I was, I don't know, 20, 30, [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=628.9599999999999s)]
*  then probably not even that far, probably about 20 yards behind him. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=633.16s)]
*  So it was right in front of me. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=635.8s)]
*  He was hit at full speed. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=639.24s)]
*  It was it was it was brutal. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=640.5999999999999s)]
*  It was brutal. The kid, he was a mess, you know, [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=642.4s)]
*  and it was the first time I ever witnessed someone die. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=645.4399999999999s)]
*  Wow. Yeah. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=649.3199999999999s)]
*  And so are you at that point, do you are you still like in pursuit [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=650.92s)]
*  or at that point it immediately you recognize, oh, this is a bad situation. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=654.28s)]
*  Now this has changed. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=657.64s)]
*  There's just a lot of dynamics to that because there's a lot of civil. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=659.4399999999999s)]
*  When you're a cop, there's just a lot of civil liability [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=662.28s)]
*  and no matter what you do, you know, I mean, even in a scenario like that, [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=664.36s)]
*  when you're when you're going after someone that has is in the commission [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=667.36s)]
*  of a crime, the fact that they're running from you and you are chasing them, [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=672.0s)]
*  it puts you in some kind of civil liability for it. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=675.48s)]
*  That that I realized at a later time at that point, because I was so young. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=678.56s)]
*  It was just it was overwhelming. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=682.92s)]
*  I mean, I couldn't even talk. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=685.12s)]
*  You literally had to stop and I lost my breath. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=687.12s)]
*  I remember losing my breath and not being able to to to breathe for a second [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=690.32s)]
*  just because it was just it was incredible. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=694.44s)]
*  You know, I probably happened like that, like that. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=697.4s)]
*  And it was brutal. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=699.44s)]
*  And it was and you just you just don't even know how to react. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=700.5600000000001s)]
*  You know, it's it's unless people come out of their shoes [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=703.8s)]
*  when they get hit like that. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=707.36s)]
*  Yeah, people do come out of their shoes. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=708.4s)]
*  People come out. Yes, people come out of their shoes. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=710.64s)]
*  People I can traffic accidents are probably some of the most [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=712.76s)]
*  simplistic, horrific things that you experience for sure. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=716.8s)]
*  And so when that guy gets hit, do you have to go render aid then? [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=720.56s)]
*  Do you there was no way to be rendered on this one. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=723.12s)]
*  But yes, yes, I can give you a lot of examples of having [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=725.7199999999999s)]
*  having to render aid in situations that were, [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=728.88s)]
*  you know, an example being another simple thing that you respond to, [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=733.3599999999999s)]
*  a drowning in a pool. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=737.0s)]
*  You know, I went one time to a kid that had drowned in a pool. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=738.3199999999999s)]
*  And you want to talk about panic. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=742.68s)]
*  You want to talk about adrenaline as you get a radio call. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=744.48s)]
*  They give you an address. And I'm old enough now. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=747.8000000000001s)]
*  I'm retired. When I started, there was no Google Maps. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=749.72s)]
*  There was none of that. Basically, it came over a radio. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=753.32s)]
*  You had a little pad of paper in the middle of your car. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=755.6800000000001s)]
*  You wrote down the address real quick. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=757.7600000000001s)]
*  You had a Thomas guy. Oh, yeah, I remember that. Yeah. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=759.6400000000001s)]
*  Shit. And 50,000 page Thomas. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=762.6400000000001s)]
*  So many pages in there. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=764.8000000000001s)]
*  And then somebody would steal a page. Yeah. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=766.0400000000001s)]
*  Well, they wouldn't steal that of your page. Right. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=768.84s)]
*  They would steal it. Like, what? Right. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=770.4000000000001s)]
*  Now, I can't go to seven square blocks of the city, even if I want to. Right. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=772.48s)]
*  These ones we would mark up and tab. OK. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=777.8000000000001s)]
*  So that it was a little easier to access. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=780.44s)]
*  You got a little bit of like filing in there. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=782.5600000000001s)]
*  But you want to talk about having a heart attack. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=784.32s)]
*  You know, I'm trying to find this and realize this is a situation [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=785.9200000000001s)]
*  that's time is of the essence. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=789.12s)]
*  But you you would get to these, you would, you know, lights and siren. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=791.0400000000001s)]
*  The adrenaline is pumping. You're going. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=794.36s)]
*  You're hoping and making a wrong left turn or something. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=795.72s)]
*  And finally getting to the home. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=798.5600000000001s)]
*  And in this scenario, I'm telling you about it was a child, very young, [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=800.68s)]
*  had already been this it was deceased. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=805.64s)]
*  When I got there, for whatever reason, panic, whatever, [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=808.28s)]
*  no one had gone into the pool. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=811.0799999999999s)]
*  I think the scenario was the mother couldn't swim. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=812.76s)]
*  So she was on the the steps standing there, you know, got rid of the equipment. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=815.3599999999999s)]
*  I could jumped in the water, got the baby out. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=820.5999999999999s)]
*  The baby was very obviously gone. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=822.3199999999999s)]
*  And but even in that scenario, [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=824.52s)]
*  I remember administering CPR just for the optics of it. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=827.16s)]
*  Yeah. You know, just to show I'm doing everything I can, [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=831.9599999999999s)]
*  because you want to talk about pain and panic. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=835.0799999999999s)]
*  You know, you talk you you you observe a mother, [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=839.04s)]
*  which is another thing that was that was frequent and [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=841.92s)]
*  very difficult to deal with is watching that pain and panic. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=846.4399999999999s)]
*  So I remember giving CPR to a child that was clearly gone [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=849.68s)]
*  until the fire department got there. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=853.1999999999999s)]
*  And they usually take a while because we're on the streets. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=854.56s)]
*  So we get there really quick. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=856.72s)]
*  Any 911 call comes in, goes to the police department. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=858.24s)]
*  They dispatch a cop, then they call the fire department and they come [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=861.08s)]
*  because we're going to fire department. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=864.72s)]
*  You got to get eight guys on the truck. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=866.4s)]
*  It's so hard to get eight guys to do anything. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=867.72s)]
*  Yeah. You know, if you've ever been to Vegas or whatever, you know, [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=869.48s)]
*  it's like you try to get guys to go do anything. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=872.08s)]
*  It's like nearly impossible. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=874.64s)]
*  Wow, man. Oh, my God, Brad. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=877.6s)]
*  There's so many moments in there of like [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=879.9200000000001s)]
*  you've gotten this child out of the pool. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=883.0s)]
*  You are like now almost returning this child to the mother in a way. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=885.76s)]
*  I mean, physically, you're bringing, you know, like [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=889.52s)]
*  that they expect you to be able to solve it. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=893.64s)]
*  Is there any of that? [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=897.48s)]
*  Essentially, yes, there's hope, you know, but it's really it's the optics. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=898.5600000000001s)]
*  It's just I'm doing everything I can. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=902.52s)]
*  Those kind of situations, the panic and the pain is so overwhelming. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=904.32s)]
*  And that's something people don't take into consideration in police work. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=907.36s)]
*  It happens a lot. There's a lot of stuff. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=910.64s)]
*  I could tell you so many scenarios like that, [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=912.6s)]
*  where where, you know, you're doing everything you can, even though you. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=914.8s)]
*  There's just not a lot you can do. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=920.7199999999999s)]
*  Right. You're just you're just a human. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=922.4399999999999s)]
*  Yes. And but they don't teach you, at least they didn't when I started [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=924.16s)]
*  in the academy. Number one killer cops of suicide. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=928.68s)]
*  Really? Number one killer cops of suicide. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=931.4s)]
*  They have a gun. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=933.8s)]
*  Yes. So you're halfway there if you want to. Gosh. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=935.8399999999999s)]
*  We had a guy that was in the police department right next to us. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=939.12s)]
*  Ended up getting to his car and with his duty shotgun, blew his head off [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=941.76s)]
*  right before he went out. The shift was supposed to start. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=946.0799999999999s)]
*  But the number one killer is cops. They never tell you that. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=948.36s)]
*  They never talk about mental health. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=950.48s)]
*  I went through the entire academy. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=952.12s)]
*  They taught me how to put on a tourniquet, heal a sucking chest wound. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=953.28s)]
*  They taught me so many things, but they never made one mention of how to, [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=958.16s)]
*  you know, how to work with your own head. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=961.4s)]
*  Well, you know, they never said suicide is the number one killer cops. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=963.24s)]
*  I think that's changed. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=966.24s)]
*  I know it's changed, but it's getting a lot better. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=967.24s)]
*  But at that point, there was no mention of that. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=969.48s)]
*  And these things accumulate. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=972.48s)]
*  I'm giving you one portion of one day. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=973.8000000000001s)]
*  Oh, I can't imagine, especially like, you know, like I grew up [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=977.24s)]
*  with a lot of childhood trauma and a lot of people have. Right. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=980.4s)]
*  And it's really common. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=983.48s)]
*  And and that is tough enough to deal with in regular life [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=984.8000000000001s)]
*  as it comes up later and you realize there's ways that it affects you [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=989.88s)]
*  as an adult. Right. Yes. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=992.84s)]
*  I can't imagine [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=994.24s)]
*  whatever traumas you already have or things that could have happened [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=996.16s)]
*  in your past. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=999.12s)]
*  And then you're now just engulfed in this. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=999.9200000000001s)]
*  You're like a do you feel like a dam for trauma for people? [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1004.52s)]
*  Like, do you feel like a reciprocal for me? [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1008.0s)]
*  Yeah, because there's so many things. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1010.5600000000001s)]
*  And then you just have to go on to the next call. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1011.96s)]
*  Is there? [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1013.96s)]
*  It depends. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1016.16s)]
*  You know, people don't take it. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1017.16s)]
*  It's just there's no way to really understand [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1018.16s)]
*  all the things that you're doing. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1021.8000000000001s)]
*  Right. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1023.52s)]
*  Let alone over a 20 year career, [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1024.52s)]
*  especially if you're working different assignments. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1025.72s)]
*  I could tell you so many stories. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1027.52s)]
*  If you could ask questions, I'll think of something. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1028.72s)]
*  I'll tell you a story that you'll like, holy crap. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1032.0s)]
*  You know, from the simplest thing of [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1033.92s)]
*  I had a I had an old lady that was at a church meeting at El Dorito. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1036.52s)]
*  It was good. El Dorito and Whittier. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1040.32s)]
*  And she ended up collapsing. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1041.72s)]
*  She had a heart attack. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1043.32s)]
*  And we got the call and we get there. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1044.72s)]
*  And by the time we got there, there's a bunch of old women [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1046.72s)]
*  that are in a circle and they're. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1048.72s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1049.72s)]
*  Betting on her, probably. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1050.84s)]
*  Well, they're doing I think it was they're doing tongues. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1051.84s)]
*  You know, they're praying and tongues and all kinds of craziness going on. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1053.84s)]
*  But no one's doing anything. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1057.84s)]
*  And I remember giving this lady and at that point, [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1058.84s)]
*  we had these respirators where you could it's like a bag [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1060.84s)]
*  with a thing goes over the face. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1063.84s)]
*  You don't have to put your mouth on them. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1064.84s)]
*  Well, I ran in and forgot it because it was in the trunk. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1066.84s)]
*  So this is another woman that I gave CPR going back to more CPR stuff. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1068.84s)]
*  And she ended up vomiting in my mouth, [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1072.84s)]
*  where my mouth was on her. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1074.84s)]
*  My mouth was on hers in a way that it forced past my throat. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1078.9599999999998s)]
*  So I vomited immediately when I came up off of her on top of her. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1082.9599999999998s)]
*  The entire scenario in itself. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1087.9599999999998s)]
*  Now I laugh about it when I tell the story. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1089.9599999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1091.9599999999998s)]
*  But it was just traumatic, man. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1092.9599999999998s)]
*  The whole thing was just like late, late, late in the passing. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1094.9599999999998s)]
*  They transport some. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1096.9599999999998s)]
*  But the whole situation is I'm giving you minor ones, you know? [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1098.9599999999998s)]
*  Right. Well, yeah, I'm sure she vomits into you. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1101.9599999999998s)]
*  You vomit into her. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1103.9599999999998s)]
*  I mean, I think that's a honor. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1104.9599999999998s)]
*  Yeah, that's a wedding in some countries, I feel like. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1107.08s)]
*  I don't know what some of the rituals are. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1110.08s)]
*  I think if you're in like Laos or something, [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1112.08s)]
*  you guys are hitched. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1114.08s)]
*  But she came back at that moment and survived for that moment. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1116.08s)]
*  Fire department got there. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1122.08s)]
*  Apparently she had a pulse when she left. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1123.08s)]
*  So I was feeling pretty good. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1125.08s)]
*  But I found at the end of the shift that she had passed. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1126.08s)]
*  There's so many. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1128.08s)]
*  So tell me, give me the first call where you have to go into a place. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1130.08s)]
*  What's it like when you have to walk up with your weapon out? [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1133.08s)]
*  That has to seem crazy because then you're like saying, OK, I'm in control. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1135.1999999999998s)]
*  It gives other people a sense that you're in control of everything. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1139.1999999999998s)]
*  I guess it does. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1145.1999999999998s)]
*  Things have changed. [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1146.1999999999998s)]
*  You know, things have changed for law enforcement. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1148.1999999999998s)]
*  When I first started, I started right at the right at the Rodney King time. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1150.1999999999998s)]
*  OK, that's that's right when I started. [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1155.1999999999998s)]
*  So when I got into law enforcement and I was a rookie, things were starting to change. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1157.1999999999998s)]
*  They were, you know, people, people want the world police. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1163.32s)]
*  They just don't want to know how it's policed. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1166.32s)]
*  That's true. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1168.32s)]
*  And as with technology, there's come the ability to see more of what policing is. [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1169.32s)]
*  And at that point with the Rodney King thing, things started started to change in law [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1174.32s)]
*  enforcement. [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1180.32s)]
*  They started to change the process because police work was really hard to look at. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1181.32s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1187.32s)]
*  And that dissemination of that information wasn't very prevalent because you didn't [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1188.32s)]
*  have social media, podcasts and all the different things that we have now. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1191.4399999999998s)]
*  So when I started, it really started to change as far as how we address things. [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1194.4399999999998s)]
*  You always hear people complain about, oh, he gave me a traffic ticket when he walked [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1201.4399999999998s)]
*  up to the car. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1204.4399999999998s)]
*  He had his hand on his gun, you know, and and that is that is just a routine part of [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1205.4399999999998s)]
*  your training is that you you have no idea what you're walking up to. [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1210.4399999999998s)]
*  You walk up to some you pull someone over speeding and you walk to their car. [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1213.4399999999998s)]
*  You have no idea what you're walking up to. [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1217.4399999999998s)]
*  You don't know who you're walking up to. [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1219.4399999999998s)]
*  You don't know who it is. [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1220.56s)]
*  You don't know what they've done. [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1221.56s)]
*  You know where they came from. [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1222.56s)]
*  You have no idea what's going on. [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1223.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1225.56s)]
*  And we had an officer that did traffic stop and there's a body in the trunk. [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1226.56s)]
*  Oh, wow. [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1228.56s)]
*  You know, he didn't even he gave a ticket and left. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1229.56s)]
*  The only reason we found that out is he got pulled over again. [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1231.56s)]
*  They found this ticket going this guy's got pulled over an hour ago and they ended up [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1233.56s)]
*  finding the body in the trunk. [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1236.56s)]
*  So the first guy didn't find the body now. [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1237.56s)]
*  Oh, no. [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1239.56s)]
*  So the guy thought he got away, but he got pulled over again. [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1240.56s)]
*  But the whole gun concept of it is is things happen fast. [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1242.56s)]
*  Yeah, it's happened fast. [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1247.56s)]
*  You know, you you you'll die in one hundredth of a second. [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1249.6799999999998s)]
*  You know, people don't realize that. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1252.6799999999998s)]
*  That's how you put your hands on the steering wheel, yada yada, all the things that we say [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1253.6799999999998s)]
*  for our safety. [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1257.6799999999998s)]
*  And there's this expectation by the public of if someone comes at you with a baseball [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1259.6799999999998s)]
*  bat, high as a kite, sweating shirt off, crazy, you know, and the expectation of the public [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1263.6799999999998s)]
*  is, is, well, you got to get a baseball bat and you got to fight him with a baseball bat. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1269.6799999999998s)]
*  Right. [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1272.6799999999998s)]
*  It's got to be fair. [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1273.6799999999998s)]
*  You know, you you shot him. [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1274.6799999999998s)]
*  All you had was a baseball bat. [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1275.6799999999998s)]
*  And for me, guys that are cops, you hear that and you just go, that's insane. [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1277.8s)]
*  Do you really have an expectation me to get in a baseball bat fight? [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1281.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1284.8s)]
*  You know, I'm not here. [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1285.8s)]
*  The only thing a cop's trying to do is trying to stop the situation. [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1287.8s)]
*  He's trying to eliminate the threat. [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1289.8s)]
*  Right. [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1291.8s)]
*  If there's some dude roving around with a baseball bat, I think you got to take him [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1292.8s)]
*  out the game. [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1296.8s)]
*  Depending on the scenario, like anybody, if you're in your home and someone breaks into [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1297.8s)]
*  your home, you still have someone breaks in your home in the middle of night today. [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1301.8s)]
*  You still have an obligation to prove that you are in fear for your life. [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1304.9199999999998s)]
*  Wow. [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1308.9199999999998s)]
*  So if there's some guy standing in your bedroom and you wake up and you look and there's a [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1309.9199999999998s)]
*  guy standing there and you grab your gun and you eliminate the threat, you're still going [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1312.9199999999998s)]
*  to go to court and they're still going to try to prove that you were not in fear for [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1316.9199999999998s)]
*  your life. [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1320.9199999999998s)]

*  Is that more lawyers or is that more the actual criminal because he doesn't want to go to [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1322.9199999999998s)]
*  jail? [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1327.9199999999998s)]

*  It's going to go to the detective. [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1330.9199999999998s)]
*  Detectives could take it to the district attorney. [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1331.9199999999998s)]
*  District attorneys can take a look at and make a decision. [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1333.04s)]
*  Is this something that we is this guy violate the law? [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1335.04s)]
*  Was he justified? [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1338.48s)]
*  Was he justified shooting this individual? [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1339.72s)]
*  So in that process, they'll look at it. [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1342.48s)]
*  You know, where was he shot? [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1344.2s)]

*  Yeah. [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1523.64s)]
*  How do we know if we have that or not? [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1524.64s)]
*  You have to get it. [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1525.64s)]
*  It's like a license. [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1526.64s)]
*  It's like a fishing license, you know, a little more complex. [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1527.64s)]
*  California is tough. [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1529.88s)]
*  California is tough to get a CCW. [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1530.88s)]
*  You go to Texas, it's a lot easier. [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1531.88s)]
*  And the logic behind that is, like, I personally believe, I know the big debate right now is [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1533.9599999999998s)]
*  guns, no guns, get rid of guns. [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1539.6399999999999s)]
*  That ship has sailed. [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1542.08s)]
*  Right. [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1543.08s)]
*  We are inundated. [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1544.08s)]
*  Right. [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1545.08s)]
*  And if we did do that, we said, bring all your guns in. [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1546.08s)]
*  The only guys that are bringing their guns are guys like me. [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1547.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1549.7199999999998s)]
*  You know, the bad guys ain't bringing their guns. [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1550.7199999999998s)]
*  No. [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1551.7199999999998s)]
*  So that ship is completely sailed. [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1552.7199999999998s)]
*  So the idea for me is I feel like we need more guns. [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1554.1599999999999s)]
*  I think we need more guns in good people's hands. [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1557.08s)]
*  Wow. [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1559.36s)]
*  How do you know then? [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1560.3999999999999s)]
*  Do you like do like how? [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1561.84s)]
*  What do you say? [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1563.84s)]
*  Good people. [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1564.84s)]
*  And do we need all types of guns? [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1566.6399999999999s)]
*  Like you see these young kids or, you know, a lot of these school shooter, you see people [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1568.3999999999999s)]
*  getting guns like these high powered rifles and stuff. [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1571.76s)]
*  For me, I feel like if you haven't served with that gun, like militarily, I feel like [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1576.7199999999998s)]
*  you shouldn't be able to have access to that gun. [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1583.56s)]
*  Right. [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1586.4799999999998s)]
*  Because at least then there's some you're at least putting in the hands of maybe of [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1587.92s)]
*  someone that has some semblance of a purpose, knows how to use it, I guess. [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1592.08s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1598.16s)]
*  For some reason, that helps me a little bit think about that kind of stuff. [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1599.16s)]
*  But to think that like someone needs an assault rifle, like a 20 year old, it just seems that [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1602.24s)]
*  seems crazy to me. [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1607.96s)]
*  You know what it does to me too. [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1609.6s)]
*  I'm not a I'm not a gun guy. [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1610.88s)]
*  Since I retired, I've got some guns that my dad had since he's passing the safe. [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1613.1200000000001s)]
*  I got my one gun I carried on duty. [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1616.96s)]
*  I don't have any more. [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1618.3600000000001s)]
*  Obviously, a lot of cops are gun guys. [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1619.3600000000001s)]
*  A lot of guys have AR 15s, you know, you name it, MP5s all the way down. [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1621.72s)]
*  I don't I don't see the necessity for them. [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1627.08s)]
*  Again, you're going back to the problem. [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1629.64s)]
*  The problem is, is we can't get rid of them, because all we'll be doing is taking them [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1631.3600000000001s)]
*  from the good people. [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1636.2s)]
*  Right. [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1637.2s)]
*  And now we got a whole bunch of and when I say bad people, just people that would use [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1638.2s)]
*  that gun in a negative way. [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1642.24s)]
*  Right. [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1645.08s)]
*  I'm not going to have to pay a commission of crimes or whatever. [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1646.1999999999998s)]
*  So, again, that ship is sailed. [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1647.6799999999998s)]
*  I'm not a hunter. [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1650.6399999999999s)]
*  I can't imagine killing anything. [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1651.6399999999999s)]
*  I even have a hard time fishing. [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1653.1599999999999s)]
*  You know, I just I'm I'm not that guy. [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1654.8s)]
*  But their justification always is hunting isn't necessarily no. [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1658.1599999999999s)]
*  But I mean, it's a waste of time. [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1660.72s)]
*  The ship sailed. [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1662.28s)]
*  You know, we just have to deal with what we have now. [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1663.28s)]
*  There's no collecting guns, not in this country. [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1665.12s)]
*  Yeah, I agree. [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1668.06s)]
*  It seems it just seems almost like a battle cry that people it almost seems like people [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1669.06s)]
*  and use it to just incite like it's a nice dream. [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1673.92s)]
*  Yes. [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1678.2s)]
*  But it's just unrealistic. [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1679.2s)]
*  And also this country was kind of founded on somebody pulling a gun on somebody who [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1680.48s)]
*  didn't have a gun. [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1683.96s)]
*  I feel like maybe I don't know. [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1685.2s)]
*  I wasn't there. [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1686.64s)]
*  But if like like troops pulled the guns on the Indians and then I just wonder how much [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1687.64s)]
*  of that really goes over through time, too. [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1692.5600000000002s)]
*  You know, well, I think the big argument for gun nuts is, is that it's the government, [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1694.6000000000001s)]
*  you know, I mean, to never allow that situation to happen again. [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1699.6000000000001s)]
*  Or this power that is policing us. [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1703.1599999999999s)]
*  That makes sense, too. [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1706.08s)]
*  Can inflict their will on us. [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1707.7199999999998s)]
*  Well, that makes sense, too, especially now with like social media platforms, like people. [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1708.9199999999998s)]
*  You can't even say certain things. [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1712.6s)]
*  Yes. [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1714.1599999999999s)]
*  So people's voices have really been I'm not saying they've been ceased because we have [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1715.1599999999999s)]
*  a voice here today, but they've certainly been corralled and earmarked with expectations, [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1718.8s)]
*  I feel like. [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1726.6799999999998s)]
*  So at that point, you're going to have a really tough time if people don't even have their [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1727.6799999999998s)]
*  voice anymore to take people's guns. [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1731.56s)]
*  You're just going to have a tough time doing it. [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1734.24s)]
*  It's just a conversation. [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1736.72s)]
*  It's a waste of time. [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1737.72s)]
*  Right. [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1738.72s)]
*  It's like it's it's it's all it's across the board. [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1739.72s)]
*  All those conversations, the big conversation now and racism. [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1741.1599999999999s)]
*  Wouldn't that be wonderful if we can end racism? [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1744.24s)]
*  But we're never going to. [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1746.32s)]
*  Yeah, it's always going to be here. [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1747.32s)]
*  So we need to that cry needs to change. [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1748.84s)]
*  It needs to be individual accountability. [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1750.3999999999999s)]
*  That's the only that is the only path that we have is individual accountability. [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1752.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1757.32s)]
*  You know, there's always going to be bad people. [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1758.32s)]
*  You know? [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1759.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1760.32s)]
*  Yeah, it's OK. [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1762.08s)]
*  Do you need it to be on? [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1763.08s)]
*  No, I don't. [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1764.56s)]
*  A few minutes ago, it made that sound. [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1765.56s)]
*  It made me nervous. [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1766.56s)]
*  I thought I had a damn life alert bracelet that I forgot about. [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1767.56s)]
*  Life alert. [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1771.8s)]
*  So tell me this. [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1773.96s)]
*  Tell me about this. [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1774.96s)]
*  We'll get back into some of this stuff, man. [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1775.96s)]
*  And it's really interesting. [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1777.32s)]
*  And thank you so much for for sharing your inside information and just some of your insight. [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1778.32s)]
*  You know, pleasure. [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1782.6s)]
*  So taking on some of the drug stories, because that's the part that seems kind of crazy. [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1784.48s)]
*  You ever roll up on some people and they're just yacked out of their brain, bro. [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1787.8000000000002s)]
*  And it's that late night hour, you know, maybe just some hookers lurking or something like [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1791.92s)]
*  because I've been there myself. [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1796.48s)]
*  So I'm just wondering how we I've never had it where the cops show up, you know? [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1797.48s)]
*  So I'm just wondering, is that weird edge there where you're like, damn, a cop, you [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1802.2s)]
*  know? [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1805.72s)]
*  I've had in narcs and out of narcotics. [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1806.72s)]
*  I'll give you a patrol one very early on middle of the day. [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1809.68s)]
*  I remember it was hot. [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1813.8000000000002s)]
*  It was summer. [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1814.8000000000002s)]
*  We got a call about an individual in the middle of an intersection naked. [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1815.96s)]
*  So we drive down to the intersection and we're talking about a busy, busy. [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1819.9199999999998s)]
*  I had started in South Central. [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1823.3999999999999s)]
*  Busy intersection. [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1825.8799999999999s)]
*  Middle of the day. [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1827.8799999999999s)]
*  Huge, huge dude in the middle of the intersection, butt naked, covered in sweat, [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1829.68s)]
*  and going in circles, which was causing in the middle of the intersection people to slow [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1834.6399999999999s)]
*  as they were going through. [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1839.52s)]
*  So what he was doing as they slowed, he would run up to their car and try to dive through [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1840.48s)]
*  their window or break the window out. [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1844.84s)]
*  Oh, wow. [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1846.76s)]
*  And people would panic and take off and leave. [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1847.76s)]
*  This was back when I started and PCP was a big deal in Los Angeles. [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1850.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1855.1999999999998s)]
*  And based on what I saw, that's pretty common. [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1856.1999999999998s)]
*  Guys on PCP to shed their clothes. [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1858.24s)]
*  And was it was that more of a drug? [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1860.1599999999999s)]
*  Some drugs are for certain are used more in certain communities. [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1862.6799999999998s)]
*  Was it more of a black community drug, a white community drug? [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1865.08s)]
*  Is it more of a poor drug, a rich drug? [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1867.48s)]
*  It was a black community, Hispanic community. [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1870.72s)]
*  Again, I can't I can't say that's not definitive. [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1874.0s)]
*  But yeah, but the problem with that for me to tell you, I'll tell you what it was. [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1877.24s)]
*  And that's what I experienced in the neighbors. [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1880.88s)]
*  But I started in a black community. [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1882.0s)]
*  I was in South Central and I moved on to Whittier, which was a Hispanic community. [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1883.88s)]
*  So those are the and there was Whittier was a little bit mixed, but predominantly Hispanic. [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1888.8000000000002s)]
*  So my interpretation of any of this is just what I experienced. [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1893.3600000000001s)]
*  I can't tell you much more. [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1896.48s)]
*  Oh, I see what you're saying. Got it. [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1897.72s)]
*  So, yes, it was very prevalent in the black community at that time. [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1898.92s)]
*  They used to smoke shirms. [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1901.92s)]
*  Yeah, that's what I would hear. [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1903.1599999999999s)]
*  I've seen it on movies and stuff. [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1904.1599999999999s)]
*  They would feature that on movies. [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1905.52s)]
*  I remember crazy. [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1906.72s)]
*  That shit was crazy. [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1908.36s)]
*  And that shit really died off. [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1909.24s)]
*  It died off quick by the time I really marching or dancing. [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1910.3999999999999s)]
*  Was there any kind of like fluidity to it? [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1913.28s)]
*  Was it like capoeira kind of or was it like just like a maniac, [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1915.56s)]
*  like a wrestler coming into the ring? [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1920.0s)]
*  Like, was there any fucking maniacs? [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1921.6399999999999s)]
*  Yeah, completely, totally out of control, completely and totally being for being conscious. [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1923.72s)]
*  They were totally incoherent. [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1928.32s)]
*  Wow. There was no reasoning with them. [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1929.6399999999999s)]
*  And they were extraordinarily strong. [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1931.48s)]
*  That drug would bring out. [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1933.2s)]
*  Extraordinary strength. [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1935.92s)]
*  Yeah, so when we pulled up and I recognized as I saw there, [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1937.08s)]
*  obviously there was a situation where there was a threat to the public [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1940.04s)]
*  because this guy's trying to get into cars and people are still trying to pass. [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1944.24s)]
*  They're still trying to go through the intersection, even though there's a naked, [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1947.56s)]
*  you know, dude in the middle of it. [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1950.44s)]
*  So what I end up doing is just driving around this guy in circles, [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1952.56s)]
*  clearing this section with my lights and siren on and all that noise and lights [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1956.48s)]
*  and the confusion kind of kept him in the middle. [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1960.6s)]
*  It kept him in the middle. He would walk a little bit, but I would. [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1963.6s)]
*  I kept doing these circles until more police officers got there. [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1966.08s)]
*  And the good thing about Los Angeles is that when you call for help, [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1969.8799999999999s)]
*  there's so many neighboring police agencies, sheriffs, LAPD, yada, yada, [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1973.1599999999999s)]
*  that they're there quick and a lot. [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1976.84s)]
*  And we had a lot of police officers quick. [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1979.12s)]
*  So we end up doing is getting out of the car and kind of circling this guy. [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1982.04s)]
*  Well, now it's on because there's not a lot that we can do. [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1985.04s)]
*  And this is back in the day when we didn't have a lot of really efficient, [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1988.72s)]
*  less than lethal stuff. Right. [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1993.48s)]
*  I mean, they used to issue saps, which is crazy. [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1995.8799999999999s)]
*  A sap is a it's a it's a little leather club. [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=1998.84s)]
*  Bring it up, Zach. Let's look at it. [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2002.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's a little leather club that has sand. [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2003.9199999999998s)]
*  And that sole purpose was just to beat on somebody. Wow. [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2006.44s)]
*  And they police uniforms have a little pocket in the back of the leg. [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2009.84s)]
*  And you put the sap in there. [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2013.32s)]
*  They even had sap gloves where you put them on and have the sand thing, [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2014.28s)]
*  which, looking back now, yeah, there's all kinds of different examples of the sap. [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2017.8s)]
*  Those things hurt. Yeah. [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2021.56s)]
*  Those things are brutal and they're compact and they're they're very effective. [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2023.64s)]
*  If they were used in the right scenario, it totally outdated. [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2026.72s)]
*  They're totally gone. Now we've found much better ways [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2029.1200000000001s)]
*  to address situations. [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2033.0800000000002s)]
*  But back in the day, that's what they gave you. [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2034.52s)]
*  And how long was it? How long is it? [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2036.3600000000001s)]
*  It's like a couple of feet. OK, damn. [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2038.04s)]
*  How long? You know, something you can carry on you. [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2039.52s)]
*  But standard issue. [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2041.76s)]
*  Even then it went to the baton. Yeah. [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2042.92s)]
*  Some people still carry the batons become extinct [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2045.44s)]
*  because the baton is just it's just the dynamic of the way it looks being used. [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2048.04s)]
*  It's just ugly. Oh, yeah. [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2052.56s)]
*  Yeah, I agree. The optics of it. The optics is tough. [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2054.48s)]
*  And my friend Chad got a job after Katrina. [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2056.96s)]
*  They were hiring anybody to be security, right, because they needed, you know, [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2060.0s)]
*  everything was unsecure. And [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2063.08s)]
*  he only weighed probably 95 pounds or something. He was small. [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2065.84s)]
*  I think he's like a premature baby or something. [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2068.68s)]
*  Or I don't know if he was premature. He was kind of immature, but he was [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2070.48s)]
*  I guess he was premature or whatever, but he probably he probably had seven months [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2074.2000000000003s)]
*  on him, you know, gestating, you know. [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2077.52s)]
*  And so when he said when they gave him that billy club, [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2079.8s)]
*  it weighed him down so much. Yeah. [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2083.56s)]
*  Just because of how strong he was that after like a week [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2085.68s)]
*  and he had like almost dislocated his hip just walking around. [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2088.76s)]
*  So we had to quit. Yeah. [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2091.48s)]
*  But that's a tool that died really after Rodney King. [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2093.0s)]
*  They still have them. They still carry them. [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2095.8s)]
*  They still train a lot of them, but it's just bad optics. [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2097.2400000000002s)]
*  Yeah, the optics of that went down after that. [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2099.56s)]
*  OK, so go on. [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2101.92s)]
*  So anyways, we we got this guy's circle. [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2102.96s)]
*  You got the bull in the china shop. [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2105.04s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. This guy is nuts. [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2106.32s)]
*  So now the situation is, is that, you know, again, police work a lot. [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2107.64s)]
*  Even back then, it's optics. Right. [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2112.48s)]
*  You know, we everyone's watching you right now. [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2114.2000000000003s)]
*  So you not only have the dynamic of I'm dealing with a guy and if I remember him, [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2117.04s)]
*  he was big and I'm a big guy and I remember this guy was big. [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2120.6800000000003s)]
*  And it was just intimidating. [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2123.7200000000003s)]
*  He's high as a kite and he's sweating and he's growling and the whole thing. [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2124.84s)]
*  So this is this is not going to be a simple situation. [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2128.56s)]
*  Again, didn't have the tasers. [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2130.84s)]
*  We didn't have we didn't have those things. [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2132.8s)]
*  What about a net? Didn't have a net. [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2135.0s)]
*  Didn't have there's a lot of less than lethal stuff that they're introducing now [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2137.4s)]
*  that we just didn't have it back then. [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2140.52s)]
*  You know, and I guess it was because it's like anything. [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2141.96s)]
*  It's evolution. Right. [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2145.5600000000004s)]
*  You don't need it till you need it. [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2147.48s)]
*  Or you don't need it until whatever you had before is no longer socially acceptable. [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2148.7200000000003s)]
*  Right. Rodney King pretty much killed the baton. [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2153.32s)]
*  It really did. It really did. [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2155.2000000000003s)]
*  And it's not a bad thing. Yeah. [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2156.76s)]
*  You know, they found better ways. [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2158.96s)]
*  But we didn't have it back then. [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2160.48s)]
*  So now the situation was how so we're going to bum rush this guy. [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2161.44s)]
*  We're all going to have to go go in and get this guy. [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2164.2s)]
*  I actually had this scenario twice. [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2166.16s)]
*  Well, in police work, the newest guys get the worst assignments. [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2168.2400000000002s)]
*  You know, unfortunately, in that scenario right there, it was a lot of age, [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2172.96s)]
*  different agencies. Everyone didn't know. [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2176.36s)]
*  So I remember the sergeant pointing out guys that were obviously new. [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2177.64s)]
*  And they essentially rushed this guy who's completely naked [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2182.08s)]
*  on a hundred plus degree day on the asphalt [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2186.7200000000003s)]
*  in the middle of an intersection in Los Angeles. [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2190.2000000000003s)]
*  And it was on. Wow. [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2192.6000000000004s)]
*  Man, I mean, it was on for a while. [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2193.96s)]
*  And then once one guy got to the ground and everyone gets in. [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2195.44s)]
*  And even when you have you can only have so many people involved [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2199.0400000000004s)]
*  just because of space factor. Yeah. [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2203.1600000000003s)]
*  I mean, and even with having five, six, seven, eight, nine guys on this guy, [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2205.6000000000004s)]
*  it took 15, 20 minutes to get him in custody, you know, [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2210.8s)]
*  to actually get his hands behind his back and get handcuffs on. Right. [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2214.72s)]
*  By the time that shit's done, you're covered in all kinds of shit. [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2217.7999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, sure. You know what I mean? [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2221.52s)]
*  You've been out there. Yeah, you're good. Yeah. [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2223.04s)]
*  And especially when you guys all go running at him, I bet it's like [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2224.9599999999996s)]
*  it's almost like spin the bottle, like the last thing you want to get [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2228.3199999999997s)]
*  is the guy who runs right at, you know, straight at his wiener. [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2230.9599999999996s)]
*  Exactly. To be honest. Totally. [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2234.24s)]
*  The other scenario having that to make it real quick, we had a guy that we got to call [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2236.64s)]
*  someone saw a guy looking through their little girl, saw a guy looking through a window. [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2240.68s)]
*  Oh, man. Yeah. And Tom. [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2244.12s)]
*  Essentially, we get to the house, we get there, she shows us the window, [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2246.64s)]
*  we find the window below the window. They're semen. Oh. [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2249.6s)]
*  So this guy had been looking through the window at the little girl and, you know, [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2253.24s)]
*  doing doing his his business. Yeah. Masturbating. [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2256.36s)]
*  There you go. And so we we ended up looking for the guy. [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2259.56s)]
*  We end up finding him in some bushes not too far away. [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2262.44s)]
*  Again, white guy, creepy, tall, totally naked. Yeah. [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2264.68s)]
*  And his testicles were the size of a softball purple. [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2269.16s)]
*  And what we what we later found out is he had tied a kite string [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2272.64s)]
*  around the base of his balls. [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2276.24s)]
*  And for some reason, that did something for him. [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2278.12s)]
*  But what we did do is it made his balls really swell up. [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2281.44s)]
*  Yeah. And it was visible. [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2285.0s)]
*  So you got a guy that's completely sweaty. [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2286.24s)]
*  He's not coming out of the bushes. [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2288.68s)]
*  You see, he's got big, giant purple testicles. [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2290.48s)]
*  Something's wrong. [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2292.72s)]
*  Again, got all the officers there circled it. [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2294.56s)]
*  But at that point, I was the youngest. [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2296.52s)]
*  This was just our police department. [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2298.16s)]
*  So they go on in there and get this guy out. [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2299.68s)]
*  So I had to spend about five minutes [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2303.3999999999996s)]
*  wrestling a dude that's naked with big, giant purple balls [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2307.7999999999997s)]
*  and a kite string around it, dripping in sweat while all my peers [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2311.04s)]
*  and friends were around me pointing and laughing. [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2314.72s)]
*  Literally, it was crazy. It was crazy. [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2317.24s)]
*  And then at the end of it, when I booked him in, [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2320.64s)]
*  I had to cut the string off. Oh, come on. [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2322.3199999999997s)]
*  Can't put him in the jail cell with that on like it's a grand opening or something. [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2324.96s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2329.0s)]
*  I actually had to cut the string off and book it in as evidence. [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2330.32s)]
*  Oh, man. And did those nuts subside once you took that string off him? [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2333.8s)]
*  I don't remember. I don't remember. [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2338.36s)]
*  That was the last that was the only visual I was trying not to deal with. [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2340.1200000000003s)]
*  You know, I remember it being very difficult to get those scissors in there. [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2342.7200000000003s)]
*  You know, I did. Oh, I bet. [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2346.1200000000003s)]
*  Cut that thing off. [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2347.44s)]
*  Can't give him scissors and tell him to do it. [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2348.84s)]
*  It's a situation where you just can't do that. [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2350.56s)]
*  Booking people, booking people was tough. Yeah. [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2352.6s)]
*  I had a homeless guy that I booked and you have to do a strip search on everybody. [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2355.24s)]
*  No. Oh, yeah. You can't put him in the cell. [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2359.7599999999998s)]
*  Can't put him in the cell without doing a strip search. [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2362.4399999999996s)]
*  You got to make sure that everything is going to hurt themselves or others with. [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2364.04s)]
*  So every single guy that you arrest, [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2366.9599999999996s)]
*  you essentially see the crack of their ass. [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2369.9599999999996s)]
*  You see him naked. [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2372.64s)]
*  You know, I had a homeless guy where I got naked and squat and cough. [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2373.64s)]
*  And when he squat, we have him turn the opposite way. [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2377.6s)]
*  We have squat and we have him cough and spread their butt cheeks [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2379.7999999999997s)]
*  and make sure they don't have anything in their butt. [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2382.04s)]
*  Oh, yeah. And he had heroin balloons all matted up in his ass hair. [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2383.72s)]
*  Where he had obviously put him in there to hide them. [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2390.52s)]
*  Oh, yeah. You know, and they're little colorful balloons. [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2392.3599999999997s)]
*  That's how they would do the store, the heroin. [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2394.2799999999997s)]
*  They put it inside the flay of balloons. [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2396.0s)]
*  So we told him, take you need to pull those out, pull those out. [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2397.9199999999996s)]
*  And the guy wouldn't do it. [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2401.2s)]
*  You know, fuck you. You do it. [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2402.48s)]
*  You get him out, which is a great move on his part. [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2403.52s)]
*  At that point, I was a rookie. [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2406.2799999999997s)]
*  So I had the assignment of pulling, getting butt [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2407.52s)]
*  heroin balloons out of this dude's butt hair. [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2412.0s)]
*  Damn, that's that Colombian birthday party. [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2413.52s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. That's crazy. [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2415.84s)]
*  And have you ever had to get how much drugs can people put in their butt? [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2417.68s)]
*  I guess that depends on who it is. [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2425.72s)]
*  We had a guy that tried to end the jail. [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2427.28s)]
*  He keistered a racquetball, [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2429.84s)]
*  which he had slid open and put the drugs inside of it [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2432.64s)]
*  and then put it up his butt. [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2435.48s)]
*  A racquetball. What is it? [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2437.0s)]
*  A racquetball, you know, a racquetball is like this little smaller tennis ball. [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2438.48s)]
*  Racquetball, you know, raggaball. [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2441.56s)]
*  Yeah, I'm thinking about it. It's just not registered. [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2443.88s)]
*  They're blue rubber. Oh, yeah. [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2445.56s)]
*  Little bit. Got that into his butt. Got in his butt. Wow. [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2447.64s)]
*  Yeah, that's relatively that's I think that's not relatively too big from. [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2450.0s)]
*  I've seen guys with Coke bottles that they put in there. [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2455.64s)]
*  I put a Coke bottle in his butt, but he it was it was open. [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2458.08s)]
*  It was open Coke bottle. [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2461.8s)]
*  But when he put in for the suction, when he tried to pull it out, he couldn't get it out. [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2462.96s)]
*  It formed a suction issue. [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2467.08s)]
*  So we had to transport this guy to the hospital to have it in an emergency room [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2469.2s)]
*  surgically removed. [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2474.72s)]
*  Oh, man, that'll make you switch to Pepsi. [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2476.0s)]
*  But also, that's like that Sir Galahad or something. [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2478.36s)]
*  What's the one where they try to pull the thing out of the sword and the stone? [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2480.64s)]
*  Yeah, it's like Sword in the Stone. [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2483.28s)]
*  Yeah, pretty humiliating situation. [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2484.36s)]
*  Tough ride to the hospital. I felt for the guy. [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2486.52s)]
*  You know, you can't sit down. [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2488.96s)]
*  That's got to be the worst thing. [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2490.28s)]
*  You keep thinking you can sit down and then every time you go to sit down, you're lost. [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2491.64s)]
*  Humiliating. Imagine having to walk into an emergency room, you know? Yeah. [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2495.4s)]
*  To get a Coke bottle removed from your. [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2499.12s)]
*  Yeah. And you have to kind of walk in like kind of. [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2501.4s)]
*  Yeah, I would probably. [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2504.84s)]
*  Yeah. And if it's glass, huh? [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2506.44s)]
*  It's glass. Oh, that's so risky. [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2508.0s)]
*  Yeah. God, it's almost like that. [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2509.96s)]
*  It's like don't wake the baby or one of those. [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2511.8s)]
*  I feel like it has like a real game show element. [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2515.28s)]
*  Yeah, that is the most Japanese game show element to it I've ever heard. [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2517.6s)]
*  I feel like it's the thing about police work that people don't realize is that you're. [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2521.28s)]
*  It's just the craziest shit, you know, [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2526.52s)]
*  it's just the crazy shit. [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2528.7599999999998s)]
*  People don't realize that they don't even think about it. [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2530.8799999999997s)]
*  They watch the movies. [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2532.72s)]
*  There's an infatuation with police work. [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2533.8799999999997s)]
*  You watch all these movies that you see. [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2535.8799999999997s)]
*  None of them. None of them. [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2537.7599999999998s)]
*  Really? There's a few. [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2539.8399999999997s)]
*  There's a show called The Southland, which is actually one of our officers. [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2541.44s)]
*  Wife was in the business and she was somehow involved. [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2544.3599999999997s)]
*  And and you could tell that someone knew about police work was involved. [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2548.7999999999997s)]
*  But when you watch like training day and, you know, all the other stuff, [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2552.0s)]
*  they're great entertainment, but people think that's real. [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2556.28s)]
*  Yeah, they don't know what it's really like, you know. [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2559.36s)]
*  That's why these opportunities for someone like me to come and I have no ties. [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2562.2000000000003s)]
*  I'm retired. I don't even I want to do guys right that are in the job. [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2565.88s)]
*  This gives me an opportunity to explain, you know, this is what's really like. [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2569.32s)]
*  So there's an I mean, doesn't you just don't you any day? [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2574.36s)]
*  It could be absolutely anything like it's like the levels of things. [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2577.44s)]
*  It's almost feels too vast. [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2583.6800000000003s)]
*  It is. It is. It's every it was. [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2586.36s)]
*  I loved the job. [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2589.2400000000002s)]
*  By the time I got out, I had to get out because it just it where your life changes. [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2590.6400000000003s)]
*  I start I had a child and, you know, seeing dead children, [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2595.28s)]
*  just all the different things that you experience as life goes on. [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2600.48s)]
*  It starts it starts to wear you. [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2602.8s)]
*  It starts to beat you down. [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2604.36s)]
*  That's that's why cops retire at 50. [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2605.6800000000003s)]
*  It's it's you got to get out mentally. You got to get out. [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2607.44s)]
*  It's just too much. It's too much. [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2610.48s)]
*  The physical aspect's not that big of a deal. [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2612.48s)]
*  But the mental is you see everything. [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2614.2s)]
*  I mean, I can tell you, gosh, I could tell you. [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2617.2s)]
*  What about a jumper? You get a jumper? [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2619.6s)]
*  No, there was nowhere where I was in Whittier. [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2622.0s)]
*  There was nothing that high. Oh, yeah. [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2624.3999999999996s)]
*  Yeah, we're pretty flat. I had. [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2626.64s)]
*  I had as here's a crazy scenario that we dealt with. [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2630.24s)]
*  We had a call middle of the night of a female bleeding profusely. [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2633.72s)]
*  We got to the house and this dude answers the door. [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2639.16s)]
*  And he is a tweaker. [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2642.52s)]
*  I mean, this guy is high as a kite, stereotypical. [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2645.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah. Radio shack manager. [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2648.44s)]
*  Totally shirt off, tripping out. [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2650.96s)]
*  Just came back, probably collecting copper on his bike. [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2654.16s)]
*  And how do they answer the door? [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2657.52s)]
*  Is it always like, is there one common way that tweakers answer the door? [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2658.68s)]
*  Like, what's up? [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2661.88s)]
*  No, not really. [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2663.92s)]
*  They don't answer the door. [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2665.24s)]
*  Usually they just just see the blinds open a little bit. [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2666.04s)]
*  Bam. You know, you can see, OK, they're inside. [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2668.6s)]
*  But this guy answered the door because he needed us. [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2670.56s)]
*  The situation was is that he was with his girlfriend and they were both high as a kite. [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2673.56s)]
*  It's like four in the morning. [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2677.72s)]
*  And when we walked in, she's laying on the floor in the living room [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2679.12s)]
*  and there's blood everywhere, blood all over her legs. [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2683.64s)]
*  And she's holding an old nasty T-shirt on a crotch. [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2686.92s)]
*  And this T-shirt is pretty saturated. [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2691.08s)]
*  So when we start talking to this guy in his, you know, in his tweaker way, [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2693.4s)]
*  he starts to explain to us that they were being intimate. [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2696.96s)]
*  Intimate. And during that, they had gotten the dildo, [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2701.08s)]
*  really large purple dildo. [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2706.2400000000002s)]
*  And he had taken a coat hanger, those old school metals coat hangers, [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2709.8s)]
*  and he had unwound it. [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2714.12s)]
*  You know how when you like if you're doing cooking marshmallows, [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2715.4s)]
*  cooking marshmallows, how you do that? [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2718.36s)]
*  Well, he essentially made like that. [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2719.7200000000003s)]
*  But he took the end of that, the pokey end, and he stuck it into the end of the dildo. [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2721.16s)]
*  And then he bent that coat hanger so it was a handle. [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2726.44s)]
*  So he was using that on his girlfriend. Right. [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2729.92s)]
*  So he was really he was going. [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2732.24s)]
*  Yeah, he was getting in there and doing what he could. Yeah. [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2733.8799999999997s)]
*  He was he was making it happen. [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2736.2s)]
*  He was trying to jumpstart that cooch. Yeah. Yeah. [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2737.24s)]
*  So one of the happening was is those pokey ends ended up [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2739.68s)]
*  coming through the side of the dildo. [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2743.52s)]
*  So when he was doing it, he was essentially cheese grating her insides. [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2747.6s)]
*  Well, I feel like right now my pussy hurts. [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2752.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah, it does. [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2755.48s)]
*  To this day, to this day, it bothers me. [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2756.8799999999997s)]
*  I don't even have a pussy. Right. [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2759.24s)]
*  To this day, it hurts me, you know. [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2762.3199999999997s)]
*  But so when he described and when he held that, we said, where is it? [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2764.12s)]
*  Where's the item? [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2768.24s)]
*  And when he went and got it and held it up, there was literally tissue. [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2769.16s)]
*  There was tissue that was on the thing. [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2773.9199999999996s)]
*  So this was bad. [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2777.0s)]
*  This is a situation that was bad. But yeah. [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2778.48s)]
*  Yeah, that's as bad as it gets. Right. [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2780.68s)]
*  Yeah. Do you press like, is it like a button you press when it gets too bad? [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2782.96s)]
*  No. You call when it gets too bad. [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2788.64s)]
*  You know what you end up doing when it gets too bad or costs [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2790.52s)]
*  have been up doing? They end up fucking joking about it. Wow. [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2792.4s)]
*  They end up it's a coping mechanism, man. [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2795.2s)]
*  And it and it it just happens. [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2797.2799999999997s)]
*  And I can remember in that scenario, the hardest part in that story, [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2799.88s)]
*  I had been on for quite a while and the guy I was with had been on [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2802.7599999999998s)]
*  for quite a while as well. [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2804.96s)]
*  In that specific scenario, the hardest part for us was not to start laughing. [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2806.4s)]
*  Wow. You know, because it was right. [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2810.24s)]
*  It was just so fucking crazy. [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2813.0s)]
*  It was just so crazy standing in the living room with two tweakers. [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2815.2s)]
*  Once blinked profusely, he's holding up. He's got tissue. [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2818.52s)]
*  The other problem was, is that we have we have a responsibility to render aid. [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2822.12s)]
*  Yeah. You know, civil liability is a big deal when you're a cop. [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2827.2799999999997s)]
*  At any given time, you can lose everything [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2830.96s)]
*  because you fail to follow one part of your job description. [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2833.04s)]
*  Rendering aid is one of them. [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2837.7999999999997s)]
*  So I remember looking at the guy who had less time on me beside going, [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2839.56s)]
*  I mean, you know what the fuck you got to do, right? [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2842.6s)]
*  You got to apply pressure, man. [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2844.96s)]
*  And he's got to do it because he's younger. He's younger. [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2846.84s)]
*  Yeah. Well, he's less time on. [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2849.08s)]
*  Yeah, less time on. [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2851.04s)]
*  So I was in that conversation looking at your buddy and saying, look at you. [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2852.48s)]
*  You got to do this, man. [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2857.96s)]
*  The the difficulty and not laughing in that situation. [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2860.08s)]
*  Both of you like you're facing and him looking me going, there's no fucking way. [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2863.2s)]
*  There's just no fucking way I'm going to do this, dude. [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2867.0s)]
*  And you're going, no, you have to do this. Wow. [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2869.08s)]
*  You have. Luckily, we we were able to. [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2871.6s)]
*  We were having such a hard time dealing with not laughing [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2875.2s)]
*  that it went on just long enough that we heard sirens and it's a fire department. [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2877.4s)]
*  You know, and at that point, it's like, yeah, this is all you guys, man. [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2881.08s)]
*  Dang, you guys. [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2883.96s)]
*  Dude, that's so interesting. [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2885.52s)]
*  So there must be such bonds kind of that are formed out there between cops. Are there? [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2886.84s)]
*  Yeah. Because I would just feel you're going through such insane situations, [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2892.7999999999997s)]
*  you know, and it's so interesting that you guys use humor to cope [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2898.2s)]
*  because it's the same thing. [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2901.16s)]
*  It's the same thing why a lot of comedians get into things, you know, things were [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2902.3999999999996s)]
*  traumatic or some type of way. [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2905.48s)]
*  And so they use humor to survive. [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2907.0s)]
*  You know, I think it's amazing that Mother Nature uses that as like [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2908.64s)]
*  like a governor on us, you know, where it's like if you get so far, you just laugh. [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2912.6s)]
*  I think it's why the Joker laughs in the Joker movies, [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2917.3999999999996s)]
*  because at a certain point, he's just so mad [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2920.8799999999997s)]
*  that there's nothing left to do but laugh at it. [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2924.12s)]
*  You know, pretty much the situations are so outrageous. [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2927.3199999999997s)]
*  And like you said, as far as the bonds, please, please. [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2930.64s)]
*  There is strong bonds. [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2934.72s)]
*  And I'm married, love my wife, we've been together for 20 years. [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=2936.04s)]

*  about a year and a half ago, just because I I was pretty sure [[00:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=3357.44s)]
*  it was a place where people could carry weapons on their own. [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=3360.7200000000003s)]
*  So I just wanted there to be. [[00:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=3363.8s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=3367.16s)]
*  I know that there's people that like to hunt, [[00:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=3367.88s)]
*  and I would rather have some of them be around. Sure. [[00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=3369.56s)]
*  These things get early. Somebody, you know, somebody rolls into a diner, [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=3372.44s)]
*  you know, with a, you know, losing, you know, with a weapon. [[00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=3376.04s)]
*  There's going to be seven other guys in there. [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=3378.84s)]
*  Absolutely. We're going to find a way to finish their fucking eggs that morning, [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=3380.92s)]
*  which is what we were talking about earlier. [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=3383.64s)]
*  You know, I believe that we need more. It's the only solution. [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=3385.2000000000003s)]
*  We need more guns and more good people's hands at all times. [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=3387.64s)]
*  Yeah. Or CCWs. [[00:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=3390.8s)]
*  You know, I really, truly believe that's what is CCW. [[00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=3392.32s)]
*  Carried concealed weapons license. Yeah. [[00:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=3395.7200000000003s)]
*  Yeah. Concealed weapon. Yeah. [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=3398.08s)]
*  I I I that's the thing. [[00:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=3399.48s)]
*  Well, it's funny because it's not even that I never even consciously [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=3401.84s)]
*  made that choice. Really. I just said, OK, I need to be in a place [[00:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=3405.04s)]
*  where I know that someone around me [[00:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=3407.64s)]
*  can have a weapon. [[00:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=3411.8399999999997s)]
*  And I can if I need to. [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=3413.3199999999997s)]
*  Yes. Yeah. [[00:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=3414.8399999999997s)]
*  It was just a it was almost like a subconscious choice, really. Yes. [[00:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=3416.12s)]
*  Which is the issue with, you know, the way the community, the way they've [[00:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=3421.08s)]
*  this concerted effort. [[00:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=3425.6s)]
*  There's all kinds of reasons why it occurred, which, of course, none of us [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=3426.56s)]
*  want to get in, but this effort to demonize these good people. [[00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=3429.3199999999997s)]
*  I'll be honest, man. I I'm not I'm I did police work for 20 years. [[00:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=3433.08s)]
*  It doesn't occupy me. [[00:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=3437.96s)]
*  I don't carry I don't have a gun on me right now. [[00:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=3439.56s)]
*  I don't carry a gun because I feel like I don't need to. [[00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=3441.2799999999997s)]
*  Police work is not [[00:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=3444.08s)]
*  does not define me. [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=3446.72s)]
*  But some of the best people I've ever met were cops. [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=3448.3599999999997s)]
*  Yeah. Just really saw and we came from all different places. [[00:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=3451.0s)]
*  My me how I got there was much different than the way most got. [[00:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=3453.8799999999997s)]
*  We were totally opposite. [[00:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=3458.3199999999997s)]
*  Yeah, there is a lot of guys that you see, you know, like [[00:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=3459.4s)]
*  they probably got their ass kicked through high school and became cops. [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=3461.92s)]
*  But I found the majority of those guys, they were good dudes. [[00:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=3465.16s)]
*  There was guys that weren't, you know, but within police departments, [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=3468.4s)]
*  especially now, they really police themselves and contain or get rid of those people. [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=3472.12s)]
*  They don't want that either. Right. [[00:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=3476.36s)]
*  And a lot of cops are just really solid, solid human beings. [[00:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=3478.04s)]
*  And in the world recently, they tried to turn on them in their entirety. [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=3483.68s)]
*  They did exactly what they said that that is happening to other people. [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=3487.64s)]
*  They completely stereotyped a million people. [[00:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=3492.48s)]
*  Yeah, it's crazy. Right. Right. [[00:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=3495.0s)]
*  They be it's like people saying don't stereotype, but then we're going to stereotype [[00:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=3496.52s)]
*  this huge group of people that are keeping us safe. [[00:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=3499.7599999999998s)]
*  And now we're less safe than we have ever been. [[00:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=3502.8799999999997s)]
*  Are we really? I was going to ask you that. [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=3504.72s)]
*  Are we less safe than we've ever? Absolutely. [[00:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=3505.96s)]
*  The whole idea of police work when I started, the whole idea of police [[00:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=3507.7599999999998s)]
*  work in its entirety was proactive policing and get out there and find crime before it occurs. [[00:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=3510.9199999999996s)]
*  I want you to shake cars. [[00:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=3516.24s)]
*  I want you to shake cars means pull them over, find out what's going on. [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=3518.9199999999996s)]
*  Find out what they got up there. [[00:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=3522.08s)]
*  I want you to frisk tickle. [[00:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=3523.32s)]
*  Yes. And there's a whole dynamic to that that's always in debate of like, [[00:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=3525.8s)]
*  oh, he stopped me because of this or he stopped me because of that, which is [[00:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=3529.32s)]
*  it's it's really not true, but it's too long of an explanation for that. [[00:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=3532.92s)]
*  But the whole idea of police work was to find the crimes before they occurred. [[00:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=3537.36s)]
*  And now what has happened with what the demonizing of police [[00:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=3540.88s)]
*  and the way that they have unfairly attacked them, like I said, the expectation is of, [[00:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=3545.12s)]
*  oh, man, he only had a baseball bat and you shot him. [[00:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=3549.5600000000004s)]
*  Right. You know, it's like, what are you talking about? [[00:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=3552.32s)]
*  Like, this wasn't even a conversation that was stomped down a lot back in the day. [[00:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=3554.1200000000003s)]
*  That wasn't allowed to go very far because that's ridiculous. Right. [[00:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=3557.2000000000003s)]
*  But now guys are losing their jobs. [[00:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=3560.2000000000003s)]
*  They're not just losing their jobs. They're going to jail. [[00:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=3561.92s)]
*  So now literally, I still have my [[00:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=3564.52s)]
*  a good friend of mine is the chief of the police department that I worked at now. [[00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=3568.44s)]
*  And they're literally telling police officers, [[00:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=3572.4s)]
*  essentially, I only want you to deal with what we have to deal with. [[00:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=3576.0s)]
*  So cops aren't out there doing proactive policing anymore. [[00:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=3580.8399999999997s)]
*  They're not out there actively looking for stuff because they're literally [[00:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=3584.2799999999997s)]
*  scared that no matter what they do, the world's going to turn on them based on. [[00:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=3587.12s)]
*  A video clip, you know, or a concerted effort once that video clip is [[00:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=3591.7999999999997s)]
*  seen of all these people in high power positions that have the venue to [[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=3596.9199999999996s)]
*  disseminate all this information, to turn on them and say, this guy did this. [[01:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=3601.48s)]
*  I can give you so many examples, which I'm not, but of of cops being [[01:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=3604.7999999999997s)]
*  unjustifiably tried and convicted on television, on television. [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=3608.8399999999997s)]
*  Wow. You know, where they've said this guy is a bad person and look at what he did. [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=3614.04s)]
*  Yeah, take me through one. That's interesting. [[01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=3620.12s)]
*  Because I agree with you. I agree. It's impossible. [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=3622.3999999999996s)]
*  How do you get all of the how do you say all of these people? [[01:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=3624.52s)]
*  And I wasn't one of the people who jump on that. [[01:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=3627.16s)]
*  You know, I'm one of the ilk that it's like, yeah, maybe there's some bad guys here. [[01:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=3629.48s)]
*  Maybe there's some people that are untrained or not trained well. [[01:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=3633.24s)]
*  But I'm not. [[01:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=3635.9599999999996s)]
*  I have always felt like I've had a decent relationship with police [[01:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=3637.52s)]
*  unless I was doing something wrong. [[01:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=3641.08s)]
*  And in that time, I didn't have the best time with them, you know. [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=3642.3199999999997s)]
*  And nobody wants to be held accountable. [[01:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=3644.9199999999996s)]
*  Even a housewife that gets pulled over for speeding. [[01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=3646.64s)]
*  I mean, I've had I've had women that look like mothers [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=3648.72s)]
*  completely lose their shit on me. Wow. [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=3653.7599999999998s)]
*  Just over a ticket, just completely unreasonable, screaming, yelling, cussing. [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=3656.6s)]
*  Don't you got anything fucking better to do? [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=3660.7599999999998s)]
*  Now there's crimes going on. [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=3662.8s)]
*  And that's just such an ignorant statement to, you know, [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=3664.4s)]
*  we have to enforce all laws. [[01:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=3667.76s)]
*  You know, there's reasons all laws are in place. But. Yeah. [[01:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=3669.6800000000003s)]
*  The I'm trying to think of one recently, I don't know if you remember this. [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=3674.28s)]
*  There was a there was a scenario right after the the big incident that occurred [[01:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=3677.0s)]
*  where I think it was like in a land or something. [[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=3682.36s)]
*  It was two cops and they were trying to take this guy into custody. [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=3684.1600000000003s)]
*  And it was a drag out fight. [[01:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=3687.1600000000003s)]
*  It was they had the whole clip. [[01:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=3688.7200000000003s)]
*  I mean, they were fighting and the guy and the suspect [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=3690.48s)]
*  ended up taking the guy's taser. [[01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=3692.92s)]
*  Remember, he ran and he turned back and he shot the taser towards the cops. OK. [[01:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=3694.44s)]
*  That guy's done. [[01:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=3699.2400000000002s)]
*  There's just that's that guy is unequivocally. [[01:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=3700.64s)]
*  The justification for a police officer to eliminate that threat is 100 percent. [[01:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=3703.2000000000003s)]
*  100 percent unequivocal. [[01:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=3708.8s)]
*  Because if you are a person, take if you are a person, [[01:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=3711.32s)]
*  a cop's job is to identify a crime, to take that person into custody. [[01:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=3714.92s)]
*  And to take them to before a judge and to have them processed for the crime. [[01:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=3720.16s)]
*  They're not there to administer punishment. [[01:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=3726.04s)]
*  I think that's where the problem with some cops get some cops get so [[01:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=3727.96s)]
*  somebody spits on your face. [[01:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=3732.84s)]
*  It's hard not to react. Yeah, I've had that. [[01:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=3734.16s)]
*  My name is Brad White. My name tag said be white. [[01:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=3737.8s)]
*  When I worked in South Central, I had a guy actually come up to me [[01:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=3740.24s)]
*  and we were involved in a scenario where I was investigating crime. [[01:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=3742.8s)]
*  And he noticed my name tag and he decided to go on a tangent about it. [[01:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=3745.8399999999997s)]
*  I see how fucking is officer B White, you know, and didn't even register with me. [[01:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=3750.3999999999996s)]
*  But I'm oh, shit. No, my name is Brad, man. [[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=3754.44s)]
*  My name is Brad. Right. You're missing the rad part. [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=3756.7999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[01:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=3759.9199999999996s)]
*  I actually got my name tag changed because of it. [[01:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=3761.48s)]
*  I just didn't want to deal with that. [[01:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=3763.3199999999997s)]
*  Yeah, I just didn't want to deal with that. [[01:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=3764.8799999999997s)]
*  I'm sure, dude. [[01:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=3766.3999999999996s)]
*  But in in the in the scenario that you saw with those those two Atlanta cops, [[01:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=3767.8399999999997s)]
*  I mean, there is just those guys. [[01:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=3772.76s)]
*  That guy decided that he was not going to jail. Right. [[01:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=3775.6000000000004s)]
*  And he was going to do anything he needed not to go to jail. [[01:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=3778.2000000000003s)]
*  And that cop's job is he can't just go, OK, fuck it. [[01:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=3781.5600000000004s)]
*  You know, you don't want to go. [[01:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=3785.0800000000004s)]
*  I'll see you later, because now that guy loses his job. [[01:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=3786.28s)]
*  He has to take this individual in custody. [[01:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=3788.6800000000003s)]
*  There is no there is no not doing it. [[01:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=3791.2400000000002s)]
*  Right. Because now if that guy goes and does something immediately down the street. [[01:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=3794.32s)]
*  Done civil liability, civil liability, and the cops are sued. [[01:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=3797.36s)]
*  Cops are sued. [[01:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=3800.64s)]
*  People lose trust in the police department. [[01:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=3801.92s)]
*  It's just it's a it's a very difficult dynamic. [[01:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=3803.48s)]
*  So those guys had no choice at that point, but they take this guy into custody. [[01:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=3805.96s)]
*  And when you're in a fight like that, when you're in a fight where someone's fighting a cop, [[01:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=3810.68s)]
*  I remember when I was a little kid, man, I knew if I run from the cops, I'm getting my ass beat. [[01:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=3816.08s)]
*  Yeah, that's just how it used to be. [[01:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=3819.92s)]
*  You know, I mean, that's how it was. [[01:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=3821.48s)]
*  That's my understanding of what it was. [[01:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=3822.56s)]
*  But if this guy is doing all of this to get away, he is capable of anything. [[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=3824.52s)]
*  When you're in a fight like that as a cop, your thought process is if this guy overwhelms me, [[01:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=3828.68s)]
*  he's going to get my gun and I'm done. [[01:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=3834.24s)]
*  Yeah, it's over. [[01:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=3836.8399999999997s)]
*  So immediately when someone starts really, truly resisting you physically, a cop's in a fight for his life. [[01:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=3838.3199999999997s)]
*  And the public doesn't understand that. [[01:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=3844.64s)]
*  Right. You're fighting a cop. [[01:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=3846.44s)]
*  You're going to do whatever it's necessary. [[01:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=3848.68s)]
*  You've already just you've already done cross that line already cross that line. [[01:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=3850.12s)]
*  I'm going to do whatever it needs to get away. [[01:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=3853.3599999999997s)]
*  So at that point, you're in a fight for your life. [[01:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=3855.24s)]
*  So those cops were so justified, even though that guy was running away, they started to chase him. [[01:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=3857.52s)]
*  When that guy turned and shot that taser at them, there's no [[01:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=3861.2400000000002s)]
*  the probability of them knowing that that was a taser is minimal. [[01:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=3865.1200000000003s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely minimal. [[01:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=3869.32s)]
*  And they put that on TV and they demonize those two guys without any kind of a hearing or any true information whatsoever. [[01:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=3870.6400000000003s)]
*  And it was criminal. [[01:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=3878.48s)]
*  It was criminal. But that goes on a lot. [[01:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=3880.48s)]
*  And if you notice, you never heard about that again, [[01:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=3882.1600000000003s)]
*  because they they put that to rest because that was totally justified. [[01:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=3884.96s)]
*  And all the powers that be that wanted to use that for their agenda, they even left it alone because [[01:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=3887.96s)]
*  it became pretty evident really quick once people start looking at it, going like, what are they supposed to do? [[01:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=3893.8s)]
*  You know, what is the scenario that's supposed to happen there? [[01:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=3898.04s)]
*  Well, and so how bad is the media in all of this? [[01:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=3900.48s)]
*  How bad how much have they become? [[01:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=3904.44s)]
*  Because, you know, it's funny, like it doesn't even seem sometimes like the government is the government anymore. [[01:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=3906.92s)]
*  It seems like the government is this [[01:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=3913.72s)]
*  LLC kind of of or America's like this LLC of just like corporations and capital interests. [[01:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=3919.2s)]
*  And that media kind of controls a lot of stuff. [[01:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=3926.9199999999996s)]
*  I mean, how scary is it to you guys? [[01:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=3929.2799999999997s)]
*  Because the media somebody puts out a clip, some some group uses it to kind of push their narrative or something like that. [[01:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=3930.9199999999996s)]
*  And then you got and then police are like, [[01:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=3939.64s)]
*  what are we supposed to do? [[01:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=3943.56s)]
*  You know, it almost doesn't leave you a place to do anything. [[01:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=3945.0s)]
*  You know, is the media like does it sometimes feel like the media is not on your side? [[01:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=3947.7999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, man, you're going into a whole thing recently that seems like it's to be such a drawn out topic. [[01:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=3953.6s)]
*  But yeah, what's going on now? [[01:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=3958.0s)]
*  I never really dealt with again, I I never had a scenario [[01:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=3959.68s)]
*  Where it was so high profile that I was dealing with the media on a personal level and have all knowledge of exactly what happened. [[01:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=3964.28s)]
*  But it does it definitely appears like the media right now is [[01:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=3971.4s)]
*  using a million people. [[01:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=3977.08s)]
*  There's about a million cops I think in America as a tool as a tool, you know, [[01:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=3979.6800000000003s)]
*  they're definitely using it and and people don't ever stop and think that's just a dude that needed a job that got into this career [[01:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=3984.96s)]
*  that's making a living that goes home and has a family is just trying to get back alive and is dealing with crazy shit all fucking day. [[01:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=3992.0800000000004s)]
*  He's been great deal with crazy shit for like 15 years. [[01:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=3999.48s)]
*  Why are we allowing this? [[01:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=4002.88s)]
*  Why are we allowing this to happen? [[01:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=4004.7200000000003s)]
*  You know, but nobody wants to be the person that stands and raises their hand because that's that's the next guy. [[01:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=4006.7200000000003s)]
*  So yeah, I'm not a media fan. I imagine most of America is not a media fan at this point. [[01:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=4012.5200000000004s)]
*  Yeah, I think so too. Look, it's one of the reasons why we've been able to start like tertiary media things like this. [[01:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=4017.52s)]
*  Yes, you know because mainstream it was just too [[01:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=4023.28s)]
*  too biased. It's so it's bad. [[01:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=4027.36s)]
*  It's if they give too much the news got away from telling you what happened and now they give you their opinion. [[01:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=4029.4s)]
*  Yeah, and it's based on who that guy is and who's paying that guy or whatever. [[01:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=4035.56s)]
*  And it's based a lot of times by people that have grown up in a hypothetical [[01:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=4040.7200000000003s)]
*  comfortable type of environment where they've never really need, you know, like they've never needed a cop really. [[01:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=4044.36s)]
*  They've never you know, except to maybe serve like a divorce paper. They've never need like they've never really been an environment where it's like, okay, [[01:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=4051.0800000000004s)]
*  this is what life is kind of really like for other people, you know. [[01:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=4058.6000000000004s)]
*  People got no idea what's going on. People have no idea what's going on in the world. [[01:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=4063.44s)]
*  Again, most cops are cynical and callous and there's a fucking reason for it, man, because you spend 20-30 years of going and dealing with [[01:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=4067.96s)]
*  the world shit every single day. [[01:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=4077.52s)]
*  You really start getting convinced. [[01:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=4080.6800000000003s)]
*  World's fucked up, man. This is a bad place. You know, I had a young [[01:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=4083.76s)]
*  through my process. I had a baby and I still to this day go, [[01:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=4089.1600000000003s)]
*  How could how could I how selfish was it for me to have a kid? How selfish is that? [[01:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=4093.0s)]
*  I know what a shit world this is. I know what he's gonna face. I know what could possibly happen. I know what walks the earth. [[01:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=4097.72s)]
*  It was so selfish. I wanted a kid so bad. I did it for me and I never even took into consideration [[01:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=4104.32s)]
*  what I've done. He's gonna have to who knows what's gonna happen to him. [[01:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=4110.64s)]
*  Well, I'll tell you one thing that could happen to him if you're a good dad. [[01:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=4114.24s)]
*  He's gonna look up one day at his dad and he's gonna love his dad so much. [[01:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=4117.12s)]
*  And he doesn't get to do that if you don't have him. [[01:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=4121.44s)]
*  So that's pretty cool. Yes. Yes. Yes. I'm just gonna be one answer. [[01:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=4125.0s)]
*  I know what you're saying too. Yeah, I feel you though. Yeah. Yeah, and I'm not judging what you're saying. [[01:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=4128.0s)]
*  I'm just kind of sharing another I'm trying to share something that makes you think positively about it, too. [[01:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=4132.12s)]
*  I'm sure it's amazing being a dad. But yeah, I could imagine that you're like what what am I bringing somebody really into? [[01:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=4136.759999999999s)]
*  Because this world to me is tough. This world is ugly. This world you don't like I said, you don't know [[01:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=4143.04s)]
*  what's behind those doors. Cops every day get invited into people's homes uninvited. [[01:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=4148.64s)]
*  Yeah, you you have never been in the home besides a party where people didn't want you there. [[01:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=4152.96s)]
*  We would go every day into people's home that didn't want us there and they had no choice. [[01:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=4158.64s)]
*  So every day we're walking into environments that normal people don't go into. And is it weird right when you walk in like [[01:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=4162.320000000001s)]
*  where do you stand in the room? That's what I always feel like sometimes I'm looking at cops. [[01:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=4167.52s)]
*  I'm like it always seemed like I don't know where like would I stand here? Would I stand here? [[01:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=4170.240000000001s)]
*  It's it's there's so much training even in that aspect as far as tactical advantage and how you stand gun leg back, [[01:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=4174.879999999999s)]
*  you know, always being they teach you to watch. I went to so many behavior analysis [[01:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=4182.08s)]
*  courses where they would teach you based on the way people sit during interviews. [[01:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=4187.759999999999s)]
*  If they're telling the truth or the way someone's acting when they're sitting of what could possibly occur next and everything's tactical. [[01:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=4192.719999999999s)]
*  Cops do everything for a reason like they 90% of the time [[01:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=4199.5199999999995s)]
*  they'll want to bring people out of their home because that's their environment. We don't know what's in that environment. [[01:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=4203.76s)]
*  We don't know what's behind that door. We don't know what's under that couch cushion. So they try to bring them into the most [[01:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=4208.639999999999s)]
*  safe environment they possibly can which is usually to bring them out of the house. Everything a cop does on a call is [[01:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=4216.72s)]
*  all planned. It's it's all in training and there's all a process to it. Wow. Yeah, there's a lot [[01:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=4223.12s)]
*  there's there's a lot that people don't even [[01:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=4229.28s)]
*  you know, there's a lot to it. [[01:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=4231.28s)]
*  Man [[01:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=4233.44s)]
*  it's really giving me [[01:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=4234.8s)]
*  it just gives me a little bit more of an understanding kind of of uh, [[01:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=4236.8s)]
*  this should almost be a class. I feel like in school when kids are growing up [[01:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=4240.639999999999s)]
*  You know, yes to have like a real [[01:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=4245.04s)]
*  like I don't give a fuck if I could spell but if I have an understanding of what the people enforcing my community what their [[01:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=4248.0s)]
*  lives are like and what my responsibility then as a member of the community could be [[01:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=4254.08s)]
*  um [[01:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=4259.76s)]
*  That would be really really valuable. I feel like absolutely. I mean even cops still need it. I [[01:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=4260.96s)]
*  before covid after I retired I went in my one of my close friends in the police department. I became a patrol sergeant [[01:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=4266.96s)]
*  and it was a female [[01:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=4275.2s)]
*  most squared away [[01:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=4277.2s)]
*  female cop you've ever seen just looked at her and she screamed cop great cop good person totally solid as time went on she [[01:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=4278.48s)]
*  started to deteriorate mentally [[01:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=4284.72s)]
*  and [[01:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=4286.72s)]
*  Because my generation had never been taught about it. We would you know, you just need to sack. Yeah sack the fuck up [[01:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=4287.76s)]
*  You know toughen up thompson. That's it. You need a cup of sack the fuck up and let's get back to business. Yeah, so we [[01:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=4293.92s)]
*  Harden that vulva buddy. That's it. You know, and we would not we just didn't know whether it was well long story short [[01:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=4300.72s)]
*  She ended up not showing up for and she ended up killing herself [[01:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=4307.04s)]
*  She ended up hanging herself and and I actually went to the house and found her [[01:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=4310.4800000000005s)]
*  um and [[01:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=4313.68s)]
*  With hindsight looking back at it. There was so many warning signs [[01:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=4315.36s)]
*  There were so many things that she did when she was [[01:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=4319.12s)]
*  Begging for help. She actually came into the police department at one point and was hysterical and acting crazy [[01:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=4321.839999999999s)]
*  And I had a pretty good relationship with her. So I told my lieutenant i'll go out and talk to her [[01:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=4326.48s)]
*  I went and talked to her and I remember walking in going holy shit. She's gonna kill herself [[01:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=4329.44s)]
*  She's so bad like even thinking that but it's almost like this passive weird thing that we just think I said it [[01:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=4333.28s)]
*  I said it out loud. She's gonna kill herself. She's that crazy things are that bad right now is what I was thinking [[01:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=4338.24s)]
*  And doing what cops did we made a fucking joke at her. I remember laughing. I remember laughing and a week later [[01:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=4342.879999999999s)]
*  She was dead [[01:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=4347.5199999999995s)]
*  You know and so even with cops they have they have to learn about themselves. I was going to do and speaking [[01:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=4348.799999999999s)]
*  Based on my experience from that and some other things where I was going all over the united states and doing speaking engagements where I was [[01:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=4356.08s)]
*  teaching cops [[01:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=4362.879999999999s)]
*  Just about mental [[01:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=4364.32s)]
*  mental health man, you know knowing what can happen and how it happens and how [[01:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=4366.08s)]
*  How you're not going to be aware that it's happening and these are the warning signs don't fuck around because [[01:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=4371.12s)]
*  You're going to wake up one day people don't think it'll it'll be them and it is [[01:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=4377.2s)]
*  A whole yeah, and it's fast. Sometimes it is. Well, I think we could be at this part in society too in a timeline of society where [[01:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=4381.5199999999995s)]

*  To [[01:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=4395.28s)]
*  To corral and to [[01:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=4397.36s)]
*  Take care of like the drains like the the sieves the things that are [[01:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=4401.28s)]
*  that are [[01:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=4406.879999999999s)]
*  the things that were that are the people that are taking care of us like [[01:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=4408.639999999999s)]
*  Mental health professionals cops it could be we're at this kind of tipping point as a society where it's like we've almost [[01:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=4413.599999999999s)]
*  We've overburdened them, you know, and you know, I don't know that but you start to wonder like [[01:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=4422.719999999999s)]
*  At what point are we just not able to be the ones to [[01:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=4429.2s)]
*  Like kind of damn or [[01:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=4437.839999999999s)]
*  Help alleviate whatever all this kind of whatever trauma or whatever it is this [[01:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=4441.44s)]
*  continuing [[01:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=4447.66s)]
*  Pieces of pain that are alive in in the universe does that make any sense to you? [[01:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=4449.2s)]
*  yeah, it's kind of ethereal kind of I think I don't know what ethereal means, but [[01:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=4453.759999999999s)]
*  I [[01:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=4456.88s)]
*  Understand what you're trying to say. I they got to do a better we got to do better [[01:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=4458.08s)]
*  So what can we do then? What can we do for cops? What are what are we doing? So you said that it is [[01:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=4461.68s)]
*  It's important. It is important. But I mean we're so we're so far down the ladder as far as like that question [[01:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=4467.4400000000005s)]
*  What can we do for cops? [[01:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=4472.64s)]
*  The first thing just just to get on the ladder. I would say be fair man. Be fair, you know [[01:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=4475.52s)]
*  Think about it. It's a million. I'm estimating that but I think there's like a million cops in america. There's a million people [[01:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=4480.64s)]
*  What we're talking about. Let's let's say [[01:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=4486.88s)]
*  A thousand of them are bad people a thousand of them. Is it our duty? [[01:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=4489.34s)]
*  Is it our job as police officers or would? [[01:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=4493.76s)]
*  To find to identify those people get rid of them. Absolutely and I got i'm not here. I'm not [[01:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=4496.8s)]
*  Advocating for police. I I have no there's no reason for me to right. Um, i'm being honest with you [[01:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=4504.54s)]
*  I'm not trying to say oh cops are this and that but [[01:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=4512.400000000001s)]
*  You need to be fair you need to be fair with cops, you know a thousand were bad [[01:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=4515.200000000001s)]
*  Don't go into it with the thought process that you have don't participate in what you're seeing [[01:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=4519.76s)]
*  You see people saying, you know, fuck the police or all cops are bad or [[01:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=4525.52s)]
*  Defund the cop, you know find a way [[01:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=4530.56s)]
*  To assist in in that process of going no, you know, that's not right [[01:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=4533.6s)]
*  These are we need to identify individuals and we need to have and people the argument they'll have is go [[01:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=4537.68s)]
*  Well, we can't have we can't have one bad cop, you know, I mean there's too much power, you know [[01:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=4542.24s)]
*  We can't have one bad cop. I agree, but it's also fucking impossible [[01:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=4547.44s)]
*  It's also fucking impossible. Yeah, totally unrealistic and especially a pressure to put on these people that already have so much pressure on them [[01:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=4552.08s)]
*  Yes, and it's not really probably going to change anything [[01:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=4557.5199999999995s)]
*  It's just a bunch of battle cry bullshit that doesn't really [[01:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=4560.24s)]
*  In the end, is it really changing anything? You know, it's making us less safe [[01:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=4564.08s)]
*  That's a good point it's making us less safe. So we do have that dude. I realize i'm telling you man [[01:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=4569.6s)]
*  We're less safe. We are we are less safe. It feels less safe out there. Yeah, we're less safe [[01:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=4573.28s)]
*  Yes, we are especially here in la we are we are much less safe [[01:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=4577.52s)]
*  Because we have a double whammy out here. We got now they're now it's shifting into where they're getting district attorneys that [[01:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=4581.84s)]
*  Are we're we're we're we're eliminating crime [[01:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=4588.56s)]
*  We're basically saying that there is there right? There's no crime. There's no crime like a crime isn't a real thing [[01:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=4593.6s)]
*  If we're not going to press charges for it. Yeah, like back back when I was a cop like if you went into a cvs and you shoplifted [[01:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=4598.88s)]
*  We would go through a process of identifying [[01:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=4605.12s)]
*  Did you go in there with the intent to steal which is an easy process to do? [[01:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=4607.84s)]
*  Where's your wallet? I don't have a wallet. Where's your form of payment? I don't have any form of payment. I have nothing on me [[01:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=4611.2s)]
*  Well, why did you go into cvs? [[01:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=4616.56s)]
*  Well, it's obviously why you wait to see we asked you went in there to steal [[01:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=4618.56s)]
*  Yeah, so now it's not just a petty theft now [[01:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=4621.2s)]
*  It's a burglary because you went in there with the intent to steal which makes it a different crime [[01:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=4623.12s)]
*  Yeah, you know so it's a process of identifying people doing wrong things and and [[01:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=4626.8s)]
*  Trying to get it to stop. I wasn't a perfect kid. I got arrested when I was a kid. I got arrested several times when I was a kid [[01:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=4633.04s)]
*  you know, I [[01:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=4639.76s)]
*  fortunately, I came in contact with police officers that [[01:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=4641.26s)]
*  That were they from what I remember were just solid human beings [[01:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=4647.2s)]
*  And I had a demeanor because of the way I was raised where I was very respectful even though I was wrong [[01:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=4651.04s)]
*  So I had a really good interaction even though I was being held accountable. I went to juvenile hall, man [[01:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=4655.36s)]
*  Yeah, you know, I wasn't really doing anything [[01:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=4660.4s)]
*  I wasn't doing I wasn't [[01:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=4664.0s)]
*  Stealing or I was my parents were really strict. I took their car first time I ever got arrested [[01:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=4665.92s)]
*  I took my parents car, you know 15 years old. Yeah, you know, I wanted to go see my girlfriend [[01:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=4670.48s)]
*  I came home went to bed and next morning. I woke up cops woke me up [[01:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=4674.88s)]
*  My dad called the cops had me arrested [[01:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=4679.12s)]
*  You know because his his thought process was is now now we're getting into shit where i'm gonna start holding you accountable [[01:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=4681.36s)]
*  And I used to look at it and go like oh dad, you're such a dick [[01:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=4688.08s)]
*  How could you do that to me? But I look back at now and go thank god [[01:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=4690.32s)]
*  Because I went through enough stuff where one day I went that's it. I don't want to live like this [[01:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=4693.04s)]
*  Matter of fact, I want to do the opposite and all my shit was misdemeanors [[01:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=4697.68s)]
*  And I was able to get rid of it and go through the process of becoming a cop but it [[01:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=4700.8s)]
*  It made a big difference for me [[01:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=4705.2s)]
*  When you say like how do we get rid of that one bad cop? [[01:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=4707.76s)]
*  They made a big difference for me where [[01:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=4711.12s)]
*  I was legally able to not make mention of the things that occurred to me as a juvenile [[01:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=4713.2s)]
*  Because I got it expunged my record and it's clearly stated that you do not have to make that available [[01:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=4719.44s)]
*  Okay, okay [[01:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=4725.84s)]
*  They do a whole background they talk to people and the people that were in my life at that time [[01:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=4726.48s)]
*  Thankfully didn't make mention of it either so it was alleviated [[01:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=4730.4s)]
*  So I was able to become a police officer [[01:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=4733.12s)]
*  And it served me well man because I knew what it was like to be locked up in an 8 by 10 [[01:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=4736.160000000001s)]
*  Room for 23 hours, right? Yeah, it's some semblance of it. It's a big deal to take away someone's freedom. It's monstrous [[01:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=4742.240000000001s)]
*  It's crippling, you know, I was [[01:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=4749.200000000001s)]
*  16 years old and I did six months in juvenile hall for taking my parents car [[01:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=4751.6s)]
*  That was back in the day, you know, you can you could kill somebody and you might not get six months now [[01:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=4756.88s)]
*  You know, but my parents said we want the maximum yada yada [[01:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=4760.96s)]
*  But when I got out and I became a police officer eventually I I kept that matter of fact shit [[01:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=4763.44s)]
*  Someone's gonna probably watch this podcast and my buddies are gonna be like dude [[01:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=4768.08s)]
*  I never knew that about you [[01:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=4770.719999999999s)]
*  But it's just not something that I brought up because it made me feel feel less lesser than the guys I was working with [[01:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=4771.759999999999s)]
*  They had this this lifestyle that they deserve to be there and I really didn't deserve to be there. I just got lucky [[01:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=4777.92s)]
*  But it served me really really well. I really had an appreciation of [[01:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=4784.0s)]
*  That process and what it does to a person coming in contact with a cop being arrested getting put inside of a jail cell [[01:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=4789.68s)]
*  Being there for 23 hours, you know at a time [[01:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=4796.4s)]
*  I was a kid from orange county [[01:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=4799.52s)]
*  I got put in a jail cell the first day with this kid. It was an asian kid. I don't know [[01:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=4802.16s)]
*  Um, oh, yeah, i've seen him [[01:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=4807.44s)]
*  Yeah, it was asian kid that was in there and we start talking about what'd you do? [[01:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=4809.68s)]
*  And I said I took my parents car and this guy went on the story was he was like a [[01:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=4811.92s)]
*  Watching gang member and they were on the run and they were in a hotel and they had a revolver [[01:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=4816.24s)]
*  And they had played russian roulette with it with a thing and some dude ended up blowing his head off and they were scared [[01:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=4820.96s)]
*  Because the gun was stalled and they put them in the carpet and they cut the carp [[01:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=4826.32s)]
*  They rolled them up in the carpet and took them into san bernardino mountains and lit them on fire [[01:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=4830.0s)]
*  I got away with it for like six months. Oh, but I shit my pants man, you know [[01:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=4834.32s)]
*  I mean when that guy told me that I was like, holy shit. I was scared to death. Yeah, fuck [[01:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=4839.6s)]
*  I'm never working in flooring. I know that [[01:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=4843.76s)]
*  But dang, no, that's crazy. That's if you're in a cell with that dude, you're like damn [[01:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=4846.24s)]
*  Yeah, especially if you're like this isn't the avenue. I want to be going like if this is even the intersection [[01:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=4850.400000000001s)]
*  I'm starting to meet up with the world that I want to do a u-turn [[01:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=4855.6s)]
*  Um, you were talking about local crime and stuff like that or this type of break-ins and thievery in uh robbery [[01:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=4859.92s)]
*  We had this thing that just happened yesterday at the apple store. Did you see this thing? [[01:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=4864.64s)]
*  No [[01:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=4867.84s)]
*  And these are these smash and grab things that happen all the time. Yes [[01:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=4868.8s)]
*  Yeah, this is somewhere here in california, I think near tahoe but at an apple store [[01:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=4871.839999999999s)]
*  and it seems to be [[01:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=4876.32s)]
*  And for some reason this seems to be like I don't know if this is like a black [[01:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=4878.88s)]
*  It's like a black culture thing. It seems to be a lot of times. This is kind of black eyes [[01:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=4882.08s)]
*  I know that's generalization. I'm okay to make that and I don't mean that in a rate like black people [[01:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=4885.839999999999s)]
*  I'm just saying I don't know if this is a [[01:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=4890.96s)]
*  Like train robbing is probably like a white crime, you know, like different people have sometimes different crimes in their cultures [[01:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=4893.5199999999995s)]
*  I don't know if this [[01:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=4900.08s)]
*  Yeah, I don't I don't what there's no way to police this is there? [[01:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=4901.92s)]
*  What do you do here? You hear the people in here? Like are we supposed to do something? What do we do? [[01:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=4904.5599999999995s)]
*  You know [[01:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=4909.12s)]
*  Well, I do think we have gotten to a point in the world where we are eventually going to have to have someone with a gun [[01:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=4909.759999999999s)]
*  everywhere [[01:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=4917.0199999999995s)]
*  I mean i'm talking security of some type right like if you go to [[01:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=4918.5599999999995s)]
*  If like you're talking about like these these these shootings that they have at schools [[01:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=4922.24s)]
*  We could we can almost alleviate that tomorrow [[01:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=4926.16s)]
*  We could almost take care of that situation tomorrow [[01:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=4928.879999999999s)]
*  And if you go to israel and you try to walk onto a elementary school, there are two highly trained [[01:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=4931.28s)]
*  highly armed [[01:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=4938.32s)]
*  Military type personnel usually more than that that are guarding that school. Wow that you can't you can't even take pictures [[01:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=4939.679999999999s)]
*  They won't even let you take pictures [[01:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=4946.799999999999s)]
*  That would completely alleviate the situation that we have if we put I know they got like school resource officers [[01:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=4949.12s)]
*  But it's one cop and it's big schools. Yeah, and that's just somebody fucking with a damn whistle [[01:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=4954.56s)]
*  I'm talking about somebody there who's trained. Yeah, and a couple highly trained very visible [[01:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=4958.8s)]
*  If if there was a guy right there with with a gun, you know that was in that store [[01:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=4963.76s)]
*  But for some reason society is still reluctant to go that direction. I understand it guns are scary [[01:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=4968.240000000001s)]
*  I understand that aspect of it, but I really feel like it's our only solution [[01:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=4974.240000000001s)]
*  You know we could alleviate that situation. How do we stop that from going on? [[01:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=4978.96s)]
*  The only really way to do that is to hold that's not the first time those kids committed a crime [[01:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=4983.68s)]
*  No, nobody walks into a apple store starts ripping fucking phones off the thing with with a pack store [[01:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=4988.88s)]
*  Those kids have committed a lot of crimes and I guarantee you those kids have been arrested [[01:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=4995.2s)]
*  At least some of them. Yeah, and the problem is the accountability is so low [[01:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=4999.52s)]
*  Like my example, you know, I had the ultimate accountability [[01:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=5003.84s)]
*  There's no difference between me and those guys. I'm not you know, right? You're both humans. We're both humans [[01:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=5007.52s)]
*  You know, I mean and it I was just held accountable, you know, and it changed the way I think I didn't want that lifestyle [[01:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=5012.16s)]
*  We're not doing that anymore and people are seeing this on tv and they're seeing that they're getting away with it [[01:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=5017.84s)]
*  And and it's influencing other people to do it like what the fuck, you know, why don't we go do it? [[01:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=5022.4s)]
*  I want a fucking iphone 14 shit, you know 40 iphones in a computer and they don't have that guidance at home [[01:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=5026.64s)]
*  Maybe they don't have that that that you know, those parents that are willing to take the steps to change the behavior [[01:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=5032.16s)]
*  um [[01:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=5039.2s)]
*  Do you so who would have to hire the the the security in that position? Would that be? [[01:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=5040.48s)]
*  apple would need to or would does it become a governmental issue because it's almost becoming more like we've ostracized our police departments publicly so much [[01:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=5046.799999999999s)]
*  That security seems like it's going to become a lot more of a privatized type of thing. Do you [[01:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=5055.839999999999s)]
*  It's going to have to you know, they can't really I mean they do they have mall cops that they're at actual real police officers [[01:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=5061.12s)]
*  At malls in some cities they have cops that are high schools [[01:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=5066.56s)]
*  They they do what they can but you know, it would require a lot more funding which I don't quite understand [[01:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=5069.52s)]
*  why there isn't more funding but um [[01:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=5075.68s)]
*  It would have to be private. It's not like apple can't afford to [[01:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=5078.080000000001s)]
*  Have some armed guards at every one of their stores for sure [[01:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=5081.6s)]
*  You know and police would totally be behind it as long as there was proper training and communication [[01:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=5084.64s)]
*  And we're gonna have to go that route. It's eventually gonna have to go that route. There's just no other solution [[01:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=5089.200000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I agree with you we had this what about these they had an thing I was looking at [[01:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=5094.32s)]
*  Zach if you can find this it was about they were gonna do robots. Um [[01:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=5097.92s)]
*  This was in san francisco robot dog [[01:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=5102.8s)]
*  Yeah [[01:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=5105.84s)]
*  Yeah, san francisco will allow police to deploy robots that kill [[01:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=5106.72s)]
*  Yeah, so basically they're gonna this is this just came out a lot of people were talking about it [[01:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=5112.08s)]
*  But the important distinction is that they're not arming them with guns [[01:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=5116.0s)]
*  They're arming them with explosives and they claim that it would only be used in the most extreme situations [[01:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=5118.88s)]
*  Um, so they won't be armed with guns. It would be explosives [[01:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=5125.12s)]
*  Yeah, I don't I mean san francisco police department in itself is one that I [[01:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=5129.04s)]
*  What you're seeing right there take it with a great assault. I'm sure it's completely irrelevant [[01:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=5134.32s)]
*  I was exactly what's going on [[01:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=5137.4400000000005s)]
*  I mean you can see the title san francisco will allow police to deploy robots that will kill that's a pretty absurd [[01:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=5138.72s)]
*  Statement for what's probably really going on here, right? [[01:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=5143.52s)]
*  Um, and the associated press put this out though. This is crazy. Yeah that they would also do this [[01:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=5146.5599999999995s)]
*  Again, they're about the most middle of the road. I felt like ap but I mean you're right though [[01:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=5152.4s)]
*  san francisco pd in itself my knowledge of it, um [[01:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=5157.679999999999s)]
*  is is [[01:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=5162.24s)]
*  It's much like their community [[01:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=5163.76s)]
*  You know, it's very it's a very um [[01:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=5166.32s)]
*  hopeful [[01:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=5168.96s)]
*  Hopeful group. Yeah, very hopeful group, you know, I mean they're okay with a lot of stuff [[01:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=5170.24s)]
*  They're they're really okay with the idea. There's there's so many [[01:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=5174.64s)]
*  Things that they do. Let's let's give make really readily available needles for heroin addicts, you know, right? [[01:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=5178.88s)]
*  Which I understand the argument shooting or whatever. Yeah, I understand the argument of it [[01:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=5185.360000000001s)]
*  But there's just not a lot of thought process. Well, they wanted to give swords to homeless people [[01:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=5189.12s)]
*  I remember a couple years ago. There was a thing about giving homeless people swords so they could help defend themselves and i'm like [[01:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=5192.72s)]
*  What the fuck are we doing dude? [[01:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=5198.96s)]
*  Homeless, I mean there's another great example man the homeless situation we have fucked ourselves on that [[01:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=5201.68s)]
*  We have totally fucked ourselves when I first started in police work [[01:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=5207.12s)]
*  There really is no available answer for homelessness [[01:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=5210.8s)]
*  Because it's a mix of people it's people that want to be there. It's people that are drug addicts [[01:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=5215.04s)]
*  It's people that are mentally mentally [[01:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=5219.28s)]
*  Uncapable, you know [[01:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=5221.82s)]
*  We used to have the process where we would be able to someone call. I got a homeless guy [[01:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=5223.36s)]
*  He's taking a shit in front of my house, you know [[01:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=5227.5199999999995s)]
*  We'd be able to go there take that person and alleviate the problem for the person that's calling us [[01:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=5229.6s)]
*  We would take them somewhere else. Let me take you to this park. Let me take you where where can I take it? [[01:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=5234.56s)]
*  Is there any way I can take it take it to let me take you 7-eleven. I'll get you some water [[01:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=5237.92s)]
*  I'll buy you a little something to eat, you know, and and then you can go on your way and they go. Okay, i'll do that [[01:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=5242.080000000001s)]
*  early on in my career and I forget the agency but a cop kind of did that where he took a [[01:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=5247.76s)]
*  Homeless person away from a situation where someone was calling [[01:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=5253.52s)]
*  Drove him to the edge of the city and said walk that way [[01:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=5256.8s)]
*  So the idea was you're not my city's problem. Okay [[01:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=5259.599999999999s)]
*  And somehow some attorney got a hold of that information [[01:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=5263.2s)]
*  And decided that he was going to take this to court because that cop took someone that had not committed a crime [[01:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=5267.36s)]
*  And against his will transported him from one location to another which is the definition of kidnapping [[01:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=5274.639999999999s)]
*  So they ended up going after this cop for kidnapping [[01:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=5282.24s)]
*  So then what ends up happening by case law is it changes the process the way all police departments handle homeless people [[01:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=5285.280000000001s)]
*  You know, there's no more doing that. So basically they even made it worse [[01:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=5293.04s)]
*  Then they start saying oh you took that guy to jail and you left this his cart full of shit here, which is full of [[01:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=5296.320000000001s)]
*  Yeah memorabilia things from growing up trophies from when he was in t-ball. I wish it's usually full of shit, man [[01:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=5302.320000000001s)]
*  Just disgusting, you know extra urine yeah socks full of weird shit that he chewed on and whatever and they glitter [[01:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=5310.240000000001s)]
*  Yeah, whatever. We saw a dude with a whole canister of glitter one time. We're like what? [[01:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=5317.120000000001s)]
*  Well, I had I had a homeless guy that was so bad [[01:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=5321.6s)]
*  And when we booked him in his sock was he had a athletic sock, you know with the stripes on it [[01:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=5325.120000000001s)]
*  Filled with cash over three thousand dollars [[01:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=5330.240000000001s)]
*  And he was sitting in a gutter eating dirt, you know, it's just crazy [[01:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=5332.56s)]
*  That people were giving him money, but they start saying that we have to book all their property in it [[01:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=5336.48s)]
*  You literally got to take that shopping cart individually go through it itemize it process and put anything so now cops went. Oh hell no, right? [[01:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=5340.8s)]
*  I'm not doing this now. Oh hell no, I don't have the time right? I don't want the disease [[01:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=5348.32s)]
*  You've made it totally reasonable [[01:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=5352.88s)]
*  So again society completely screwed themselves on how we as a society can help you with a problem [[01:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=5353.92s)]
*  If you had a homeless guy sitting out here in front of your door [[01:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=5360.08s)]
*  That that cop's in a pickle [[01:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=5362.64s)]
*  You know [[01:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=5364.64s)]
*  He can still do things and try to convince this guy to leave but all the real tools that we had the real methods we used [[01:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=5364.96s)]
*  The world got rid of him. Well, why do we and is it a lot of times? [[01:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=5370.32s)]
*  It's lawyers that fucking ruin all this shit lawyers ruin everything the lawyers really have they've ruined everything [[01:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=5374.16s)]
*  Civil civil law has ruined everything civil law has destroyed our country. It really has and in america's they love civil law [[01:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=5379.36s)]
*  There's so many people getting rich. Yeah, I know of civil law [[01:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=5386.24s)]
*  man [[01:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=5390.0s)]
*  but the mental the mental [[01:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=5391.28s)]
*  The mental expense and the emotional expense of all of that type of stuff all those rules the law the impossibility [[01:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=5394.08s)]
*  Of it that the average human the average american I think because this is a really a lot of its american issues [[01:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=5402.5599999999995s)]
*  Uh, I think we're getting to the point where we're at our tipping point [[01:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=5409.759999999999s)]
*  A lot of people are on medication a lot of people are stressed beyond the gills. We can't people are not [[01:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=5413.28s)]
*  Um able to have children as easily anymore everybody's going through all this fertilization, you know stuff. I think there's tons of stressors [[01:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=5418.8s)]
*  um, I think we're getting to that point where [[01:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=5426.0s)]
*  It's a little bit at the tipping point. You don't know what a cvs now if you are safe or not [[01:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=5429.92s)]
*  You know, like I was there the other day [[01:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=5434.320000000001s)]
*  In the makeup lady is now tussling with some fucking six four man in there. Yeah, and she's just trying to [[01:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=5437.4400000000005s)]
*  You know make sure that this guy doesn't mash up her station, you know [[01:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=5445.2s)]
*  Like is the guy's running around taking stuff, right? [[01:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=5450.16s)]
*  And so then like you have people her they have to be enforcers now and she's just the makeup person in the photo guy [[01:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=5452.56s)]
*  You know, it's like they shouldn't have to be enforcers. So it's like [[01:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=5459.76s)]
*  um [[01:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=5463.76s)]
*  And then the truth is they probably should just let insurance handle it or whatever, you know, so it's like [[01:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=5464.88s)]
*  I don't know. We've just gotten ourselves into this place. It feels like a lot of times where [[01:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=5470.88s)]
*  the people who are [[01:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=5477.84s)]
*  supposed to be [[01:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=5480.0s)]
*  Helping us our therapists our police or the people that are kind of like [[01:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=5481.68s)]
*  Add this buffer to society to make us stay well [[01:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=5486.64s)]
*  Um are kind of stressed to the gills. It feels like sometimes [[01:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=5491.12s)]
*  Yeah, I don't know who's gonna police the world coming up, especially now with everything that's going on. Who's going into law enforcement right now? [[01:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=5494.88s)]
*  Yeah, what's that been like? Has there been lower amounts of people going in have you heard or anything? Uh, no, I mean I I there it's [[01:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=5500.32s)]
*  But it seems scary. Yeah, they've tightened the standards [[01:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=5506.96s)]
*  They made it harder because the world's going like oh, you know the police are doing everything they can to go [[01:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=5509.4400000000005s)]
*  We need the we need the best candidates. We don't want these problems again in the future [[01:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=5514.16s)]
*  The testing process of becoming a police officer is it's extraordinary. I mean, it's really extraordinary the tests I had to go through [[01:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=5518.88s)]
*  You know psychologists [[01:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=5526.96s)]
*  Written tests physical tests. Um, I mean there's just so many [[01:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=5529.76s)]
*  Interviews backgrounds they went my background they wouldn't talk to everybody now. Oh, dude everybody they talked to my ex-girlfriends and everybody [[01:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=5534.46s)]
*  I was just yeah, that's a good one [[01:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=5541.52s)]
*  And they also seal it and they so you never get to know what they said [[01:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=5543.2s)]
*  Which is really you should get it when you're done dude on the way out [[01:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=5545.76s)]
*  I knew where it was and I thought many times i'm gonna go in there and bug and pilp this shit [[01:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=5548.32s)]
*  But I didn't want to fuck with my pension who knows what they could do. You know what I mean? [[01:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=5552.24s)]
*  So but the who's gonna police who's gonna do it who's gonna take this job? I remember as a kid [[01:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=5555.6s)]
*  You know again, I think today I wouldn't be able to be a police officer [[01:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=5562.88s)]
*  Today they require like I had I got my degree when I was a cop so I could become a detective [[01:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=5567.360000000001s)]
*  Okay, so I went to college in in while I was working now [[01:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=5571.360000000001s)]
*  They really won't even talk to you in the hiring process unless you have a degree [[01:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=5575.76s)]
*  They're they're they're they're up really standards. Yeah, and are they paying more? Yeah. Well, it's it's progressive [[01:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=5579.040000000001s)]
*  Another year, it's like three percent. I remember being a kid. I was 21 years old [[01:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=5584.48s)]
*  I was making like 60 000 a year, you know for a 21 year old dude. I was I was big pimping dude [[01:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=5587.919999999999s)]
*  You know, I was huge. I was huge and I always shooting bullets in the air and damn catching them in my mouth, dude [[01:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=5592.879999999999s)]
*  I always felt like I was being fairly compensated. I guess because once I got into it [[01:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=5598.879999999999s)]
*  It was so exciting [[01:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=5605.5199999999995s)]
*  I hated the weekend. I loved to work. I couldn't wait to get to work next day [[01:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=5607.759999999999s)]
*  Because what the fuck's gonna go on today? [[01:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=5610.96s)]
*  That's how it was every day for a long time when I was young and I always felt like the money was fair, you know [[01:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=5612.16s)]
*  um, just to give you an idea california is [[01:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=5618.72s)]
*  The highest paid police officers in the world. They just don't wow [[01:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=5621.84s)]
*  They're also the most trained and i'm sure there's somebody that's going to disagree with that from somewhere else [[01:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=5624.56s)]
*  But it just it it is it is that's why a lot of the stuff you see you'll see like in [[01:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=5628.400000000001s)]
*  No bang on kentucky, but some police officer in a place like kentucky, you know doing something stupid you're going like that's crazy [[01:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=5634.08s)]
*  The show cops. Yeah, I actually had cops ride with me. You did I did have cops ride with me [[01:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=5640.56s)]
*  You'd be interested in how that goes how how that process is to get one. We're going to talk about that in a minute [[01:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=5644.96s)]
*  Remember that zacks. We don't forget that [[01:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=5649.4400000000005s)]
*  the uh [[01:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=5651.6s)]
*  You watch I I watch cops a lot of times just go like oh my god [[01:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=5653.04s)]
*  I can't believe what this guy's doing, you know, their tacticals and their tactics and all that kind of stuff [[01:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=5655.4400000000005s)]
*  but I just don't know [[01:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=5660.16s)]
*  I don't know what it's going to be like because [[01:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=5661.84s)]
*  I do feel like you need to pull as many people from different aspects of society [[01:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=5664.4800000000005s)]
*  Just to have that rounded structure of of of you know [[01:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=5670.24s)]
*  I had a lot of compassion for the the arrest process for people going into it. This guy doesn't understand that [[01:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=5674.32s)]
*  He's a good dude. He's doing the right thing [[01:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=5680.4s)]
*  But he has no idea the impact of taking someone putting them a handcuff putting them into a cage putting them in a cage [[01:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=5682.4s)]
*  The guy had to go to work tomorrow. We impounded his car. He's only got 300 bucks in the it's just [[01:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=5688.32s)]
*  Monstrous and I had a real feel for that right and in reality if they had known everything about me [[01:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=5693.58s)]
*  They would have probably said no, we're gonna pass on you and I was successful, you know [[01:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=5699.76s)]
*  I wasn't the best or anything like that, but I was very successful and I was good at the compassion aspect [[01:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=5704.08s)]
*  I think if you go back and talk to everybody they would go like yeah [[01:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=5708.4800000000005s)]
*  Your heart was too big for this job to start with and I kind of disagree with that. I just understood [[01:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=5710.16s)]
*  I understood what what what we're doing here. This is a big deal. Yeah, you know you you [[01:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=5715.28s)]
*  You try to explain to somebody [[01:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=5721.4400000000005s)]
*  Anytime somebody dies in a car accident in a murder [[01:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=5724.0s)]
*  Um when I was a homicide detective for a period you you have to somebody has to go tell that family [[01:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=5727.759999999999s)]
*  That your loved one's not dead because they don't know at that point, you know [[01:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=5735.2s)]
*  Do you try to act like when you walk up? Do you try to act like you don't like? [[01:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=5739.2s)]
*  Because they're looking like [[01:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=5744.16s)]
*  That would be the part for me if a cop comes and knocks on my door [[01:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=5746.4s)]
*  Do you want to look like you have that information or is the goal at first to not look like you have that information? [[01:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=5750.16s)]
*  Man you we are now in a conversation this that was one of the probably the the hardest aspect of police work [[01:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=5756.08s)]
*  Is notifying people that their loved one's dead [[01:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=5762.8s)]
*  And when you through one of them, okay [[01:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=5765.44s)]
*  Uh, I I had i'm gonna give you a traffic accident. I had a traffic accident where a 16 year old female was killed [[01:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=5767.92s)]
*  And I went [[01:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=5775.84s)]
*  They'd start the investigation and usually they'll take someone that's never done it before or whatever to go do the notification at that time [[01:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=5777.2s)]
*  I was on patrol and they said hey listen, you gotta go make a notification [[01:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=5782.32s)]
*  by the end it was like [[01:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=5785.28s)]
*  Three four o'clock in the morning [[01:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=5786.64s)]
*  And if you're a parent and your kid's out and a cop knocks on the door at four o'clock in the morning [[01:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=5788.8s)]
*  The blood leaves your face. It just does you know, that's just the way it is. You know, I mean and I [[01:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=5794.48s)]
*  I remember I did many of these and as they went on they got way more difficult, but I remember knocking on the door [[01:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=5799.76s)]
*  And being so nervous that it felt like my esophagus had seized like I literally couldn't talk [[01:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=5806.72s)]
*  I'm thinking they're gonna come to the door. I'm not gonna be able to talk right now [[01:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=5813.2s)]
*  And I remember it was it was a mother she came to the door and she just woke up and as soon as she saw me [[01:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=5816.32s)]
*  I didn't have to say [[01:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=5822.88s)]
*  You know something was wrong. She knew that something was very wrong [[01:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=5824.48s)]
*  And the process of informing a love a parent especially that their child is dead when you first start doing it [[01:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=5829.04s)]
*  You're blunt because you that's what you're there to do, you know, and I came I said, you know, are you the parent of yagada? [[01:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=5836.24s)]
*  And by then they're already crying and you so i'm sorry to inform you but your daughter was killed in a traffic accident [[01:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=5842.0s)]
*  and this woman in particular because it [[01:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=5848.96s)]
*  Again, this these are the trials of police officers [[01:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=5851.759999999999s)]
*  It right now. I feel like I want to cry. Yeah same. Yeah, I mean it just does that to you and it's it's um [[01:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=5855.12s)]
*  But I have a I have a thousand of these, you know what i'm saying? [[01:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=5861.36s)]
*  so I remember [[01:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=5864.879999999999s)]
*  I remember her getting to the point and her falling on the ground and [[01:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=5867.12s)]
*  As many movies as i've seen of trying to depict police situations [[01:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=5871.5199999999995s)]
*  There's nobody and there's nothing that could do that accurately to really depict of what that looks like [[01:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=5876.4s)]
*  It's a pain that [[01:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=5883.28s)]
*  to this day [[01:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=5884.799999999999s)]
*  I'm probably 20 years now out from that situation close to [[01:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=5886.16s)]
*  It still makes me want to cry just bringing it up. It brings it, you know, I get the pain and it's just like [[01:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=5890.4s)]
*  And as you do those and as you go through them, I had a dad that [[01:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=5895.759999999999s)]
*  A girl had hung herself and he was so upset that he grabbed me by the shirt and he [[01:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=5899.280000000001s)]
*  Started no no and like kind of pushing me back and he had a suburban and he pushed me into the suburban [[01:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=5903.92s)]
*  My elbow went through the back window of this [[01:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=5909.2s)]
*  Thing that's how hard he pushed me [[01:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=5911.92s)]
*  And I knew what was happening there. He wasn't mad at me. This guy was [[01:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=5914.320000000001s)]
*  Just so grieving but as those go on as those situations occur and as you do more and more of those [[01:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=5917.68s)]
*  And as you introduce new officers [[01:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=5923.84s)]
*  And take them to do it [[01:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=5926.56s)]
*  It becomes so much more difficult. I remember sitting out front of homes towards the end of my career [[01:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=5928.88s)]
*  Sitting in the car and and and I was a sergeant at time and I wouldn't send young guys because I just couldn't fathom [[01:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=5934.240000000001s)]
*  Me doing that to them because I knew what it had done. It's done to me. You know what I mean? So I remember looking [[01:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=5939.2s)]
*  At this particular one [[01:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=5945.2s)]
*  It was the morning was like six o'clock in the morning because the sun was coming up and I remember seeing them walking in front [[01:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=5946.240000000001s)]
*  Of the window of their home in the kitchen and me realizing [[01:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=5950.400000000001s)]
*  Okay, I got 45 minutes to my shifts up i'm gonna sit here for 45 more minutes [[01:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=5954.32s)]
*  Because these are the last 45 minutes of these people's lives [[01:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=5959.04s)]
*  You know what I mean? And because I was at that point in my career has gone off. I was crying [[01:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=5962.16s)]
*  Just the thought of doing this. I had my own child now [[01:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=5968.96s)]
*  It just it became so much larger now of doing them for so many times that I sat there forever [[01:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=5971.28s)]
*  Putting it off as long as I can and then walking up to it. It it it's indescribable [[01:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=5978.48s)]
*  It really truly is indescribable knocking on a door and telling someone their most precious [[01:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=5983.46s)]
*  Whatever husband wife dad son grandma anything [[01:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=5989.78s)]
*  Is gone and and and the scenario that you do that is so it's so vast [[01:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=5993.78s)]
*  You know, there's so many old people that live alone [[01:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=5998.42s)]
*  And the family lives far away and and no one's really accounting for them and it's august and they fucking die on thursday [[01:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=6002.179999999999s)]
*  And by tuesday the neighbors going something stinks next door and there's fucking flies all over the window [[01:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=6008.259999999999s)]
*  And they send you out at two three o'clock in the morning and you got a fucking flashlight [[01:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=6013.38s)]
*  You're walking up to the house or look at the window going fuck. Yeah, something's dead in here, man [[01:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=6017.139999999999s)]

*  You know exactly the smell of death really? Oh exactly. I can if if there's something dead [[01:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=6023.78s)]
*  And that smell is permeating in the air [[01:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=6029.3s)]
*  I smell it. I'll tell you something's dead [[01:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=6031.78s)]
*  Within these parameters, do you know it's human usually or not? Can you tell human or not? [[01:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=6034.1s)]
*  No, I don't I don't know. I don't know that but I know human [[01:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=6038.820000000001s)]

*  That you don't even take the time to hit light switches to turn the light on you're going with a flashlight [[01:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=6052.9800000000005s)]

*  Which is a whole different story [[01:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=6162.5s)]
*  Autopsies are disgusting. They're brutal. They use saws and they use hedge clippers to cut the the rib cages away [[01:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=6164.26s)]
*  Because they canoe them they'll they take away your rib cages and they take all your guts out. They cut your [[01:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=6171.14s)]

*  They cut your dome off and take out the brain all kinds of wicked stuff [[01:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=6179.3s)]
*  But afterwards as a homicide investigator we would go to those because we'd want to see the trajectory of the bullets and get a determination [[01:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=6183.38s)]
*  On what they determine how far and all the different evidence you can get from an autopsy [[01:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=6189.22s)]
*  I had this dude that did an autopsy gloves covering blood and he went in to talk to me and he went into this little lunch [[01:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=6193.86s)]
*  Room and he got his lunch out and he took off his gloves. This fucker pulled out a sandwich like a meat sandwich [[01:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=6199.22s)]
*  That meat in it and as he's talking to me as he's talking to me, he's eating a meat sandwich, right? [[01:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=6204.82s)]

*  You know coroners are a different breed man. You got to be a different breed to be chopping up people all day long [[01:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=6224.02s)]
*  Yeah, even as to be taken yeah [[01:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=6230.0199999999995s)]
*  Like you're taking vitamins or yeah if you're going to be on an exercise bike or something in the same room as like a body [[01:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=6231.46s)]

*  She had to flip this body over that was bloated [[01:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=6242.42s)]
*  So she put a rope around the opposite side of the lady's wrist and this lady was deep in the [[01:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=6245.06s)]
*  Decomposing and she threw the rope over the lady and she went on their side and she was going to pull this rope [[01:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=6250.88s)]
*  So the arm would flip her over and she'd go see the front of her [[01:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=6255.46s)]
*  So she's pulling this rope over and because the body was so decomposed [[01:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=6259.7s)]
*  It ripped off the skin of the entire arm [[01:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=6264.66s)]
*  And and the body fluids of this lady went straight up on her and on her face and in her mouth [[01:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=6268.42s)]

*  Okay, very pretty prevalent. What does it say about it? Can you tell it just give us a little more intel? [[01:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=6333.62s)]
*  Defecation syncope describes the vaso [[01:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=6338.62s)]
*  Vaginal response that occurs while defecating that results in a loss of consciousness. Wow [[01:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=6342.48s)]
*  Yeah for old people the loss of consciousness results from bearing down to increase the pressure in the rectum [[01:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=6347.38s)]
*  damn, boy [[01:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=6352.9s)]
*  So I guess yeah, you can have to I mean this guy just shit himself to death really [[01:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=6354.9s)]
*  God, yeah happens pretty often with older people something with their heart stops their heart and they die and they're by themselves and [[01:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=6360.26s)]
*  Yeah, pretty brutal pretty brutal life is pretty brutal life is I always felt like it would be a good [[01:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=6366.42s)]
*  thing for the world to have [[01:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=6372.66s)]
*  some kind of a venue where [[01:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=6374.98s)]
*  Like I got a million stories, you know, I got a million things i've experienced [[01:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=6377.3s)]
*  we're [[01:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=6381.22s)]
*  one guy [[01:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=6382.5s)]
*  One cop one story, you know and just to give the world the idea of what's going on [[01:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=6384.18s)]
*  Because nobody knows what's going on you think you're so you just the perception of [[01:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=6390.58s)]
*  How many police there are any given night in I don't give you the example of city of Whittier, which is a pretty big city [[01:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=6395.7s)]
*  there was [[01:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=6402.099999999999s)]
*  Four or five cops [[01:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=6403.62s)]
*  That's it [[01:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=6405.14s)]
*  That's it. You know, I mean that's all that there was now granted [[01:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=6406.66s)]
*  There's a lot of police around and right away and they'll come say but that's you're not really safe, which is four or five cops [[01:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=6409.14s)]
*  You know what I mean? I to this day. I'm telling you I could rob any bank [[01:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=6414.66s)]
*  Yeah, I know exactly how to do it really could get away. Absolutely. I'm not gonna say it [[01:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=6418.98s)]
*  I don't want to but yeah, I could absolutely do it write it down for me. Yeah, just because there's such a lack of of [[01:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=6423.3s)]
*  Officers there's such a lack of staffing, you know, there's such a [[01:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=6429.62s)]
*  We're just unsafe and I think if someone could put something together where they just a cop just came to say hey [[01:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=6433.06s)]
*  This is this is a story and people start hearing that every day and just going like dude the world [[01:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=6438.26s)]
*  The stuff that's going on in the world right now [[01:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=6443.22s)]
*  You know the stuff that goes on every day and has always gone on and always is going to go on [[01:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=6445.22s)]
*  I think people would be a little more [[01:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=6449.860000000001s)]
*  Understanding of of the difficulty of the job, you know the difficulty of [[01:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=6451.92s)]
*  Policing the world, you know, maybe be a little more less judgmental, you know a little less harsh [[01:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=6458.74s)]
*  Well, I think this conversation alone [[01:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=6464.259999999999s)]
*  And i've always been kind of I mean pretty much pro-police. I mean if there's a bad policeman i'ma be against that person [[01:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=6467.54s)]
*  If there's a bad anything i'd kind of be against that person or at least one to investigate what's going on with them [[01:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=6473.86s)]
*  but [[01:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=6479.62s)]
*  You know we grew up in a real poor environment [[01:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=6480.9s)]
*  And so the cops would always hang out around the poor people because we were outside a lot [[01:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=6482.9s)]
*  And so when I was growing up we'd be outside so the cops I think sometimes would be on their shit [[01:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=6487.7s)]
*  you know, and they they'd stop and chat, you know, I feel like you kind of knew the cops better when you were poor because [[01:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=6491.94s)]
*  You were outside there'd be more calls to your neighborhood [[01:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=6498.179999999999s)]
*  Because somebody was always doing something there was always some domestic violence or somebody was you know [[01:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=6501.62s)]
*  You know button some drugs or something small, you know, just some small ball locally [[01:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=6506.820000000001s)]
*  So the cops would be around so you get to kind of know them, you know [[01:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=6511.46s)]
*  um [[01:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=6514.9800000000005s)]
*  And it was kind of fun in a way, you know, and then one of them would start dating somebody in the neighborhood [[01:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=6516.42s)]
*  You know like not dicey but just like [[01:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=6522.5s)]
*  You know, I remember chicks thought it was kind of hot to date a cop, you know when I was growing up [[01:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=6525.46s)]
*  It was like yeah, I get to date a cop which you see that now. It seems crazy [[01:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=6529.780000000001s)]
*  I can't imagine there's any girls going. Oh, I want to date a cop. Yeah, I mean really who would want to date a cop now [[01:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=6533.38s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I don't know. I think there's there's still a lot of like [[01:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=6539.62s)]
*  You know america first type people I think who believe that cops are good people, you know [[01:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=6543.14s)]
*  And so those people would probably be fine with it. I think maybe more scared for the cops probably there might be more fear in that sense [[01:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=6548.66s)]
*  Yeah, the lifestyle again it goes down to they just don't know, you know, it's a tough life my you know [[01:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=6556.18s)]
*  My wife's married a cop, you know tough life [[01:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=6561.54s)]
*  Tough life, you know, but I'm out now and things are good and but it's it's a tough life [[01:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=6565.54s)]
*  It's it's a different life. The world doesn't know what's going on out there. You have no idea what's going on out there [[01:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=6570.02s)]
*  I do. Yeah, it's a hard reality to live with you never feel safe [[01:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=6575.3s)]
*  Well, and it's just not fair that there's not an accurate kind of representation of what goes on out [[01:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=6580.1s)]
*  There's there's not that that person you call there you guys are expected to handle so much [[01:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=6584.26s)]
*  Like some people are mentally unwell somebody somebody's got a gun somebody's doing sex traffic and somebody's trying to hide a kid in their attic [[01:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=6589.3s)]
*  You know, it's like you don't fucking know. Nope. You never know what you're walking into either [[01:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=6596.26s)]
*  Many situations where you think it's one thing and it's something totally different [[01:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=6601.3s)]
*  You know, I mean did you get a lot of was there a lot of that because you know a few years ago sex trafficking was like [[01:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=6604.34s)]
*  The big buzz, you know [[01:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=6608.74s)]
*  It was like you'd see things on commercial like there's a million women being sex trafficked in america and i'm like that's fucking insane [[01:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=6610.1s)]
*  But uh, I could believe that there's some of it, you know, but I don't think there's a million way, you know, like you'd see some [[01:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=6616.34s)]
*  Every few years is like a big thing. Yeah, big push, you know, yeah, I don't [[01:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=6622.26s)]
*  I to be honest. I don't know. I don't know. I never really dealt with [[01:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=6626.58s)]
*  A lot of that. I never I don't understand [[01:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=6629.7s)]
*  I don't have a lot of knowledge on that. So it'd be pretty responsible for me to make a comment about that [[01:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=6632.9800000000005s)]
*  But in my police career [[01:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=6636.5s)]
*  I dealt with prostitutes, you know without there was a lot of stuff with prostitution [[01:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=6638.02s)]
*  You know [[01:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=6641.78s)]
*  without there was a lot of stuff with prostitution [[01:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=6642.98s)]
*  And were they just trying to survive most of them or most of them just women trying to survive or most of them women [[01:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=6645.38s)]
*  That you found that had been in a beat where they were being abused by a man and used to sex [[01:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=6649.78s)]
*  money and sex, you know what I didn't I I couldn't answer that because [[01:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=6655.22s)]
*  I never really very rarely would I have an intimate conversation with someone I was dealing with right? [[01:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=6659.54s)]
*  I deal with enough. I don't need I don't want to know the story the story's irrelevant [[01:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=6664.42s)]
*  You know if you start getting the stories it can kind of change the way you handle stuff [[01:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=6667.38s)]
*  And the reality of it is is that you were soliciting i'm just dealing with soliciting [[01:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=6670.98s)]
*  You know if they go into a story of oh my god my dad raped me and this and that [[01:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=6675.38s)]
*  as a human being I think you would tend to go like oh my god this poor thing and [[01:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=6678.82s)]
*  I just got to deal with the situation because if she gives me a story and I let her off because her story's sad [[01:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=6683.22s)]
*  Well, how how fair is it the next prostitute that I arrest them just because I don't listen to their story [[01:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=6688.26s)]
*  It's another difficulty of it. You know, right that plays a lot with tickets [[01:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=6694.0199999999995s)]
*  You know tickets man are tickets are a big deal dude it [[01:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=6698.26s)]
*  Everyone gets pulled over and and they want they want to be get get out of the ticket [[01:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=6702.1s)]
*  You know, come on man. Help me out do me [[01:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=6707.38s)]
*  But the reality of it is if you were driving 75 miles per hour and I pulled you over [[01:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=6709.7s)]
*  And you're I notice who you are. You're a cool guy or we have a conversation or you're very upfront [[01:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=6714.5s)]
*  Go totally my fault totally so sorry and I go okay man, just slow down guy [[01:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=6719.62s)]
*  The next guy I pull over was doing the same exact thing [[01:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=6723.9400000000005s)]
*  I don't give him the opportunity to talk because maybe i'm gonna rush. I don't know who he is and I give him a ticket [[01:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=6727.38s)]
*  Well now i've done i've done something wrong, right? You know what I mean? I've done something wrong [[01:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=6732.42s)]
*  So there's a real dilemma with that. So when you start giving people breaks [[01:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=6737.38s)]
*  When they're the next person you're doing wrong, so that's that's an aspect people never really think of so if you're really doing policing [[01:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=6740.9800000000005s)]
*  Right, there is no gray, right? [[01:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=6747.14s)]
*  But we all want them to deal with the gray and I dealt with the gray constantly, you know [[01:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=6749.62s)]
*  And is it a real thing that you have to like people like all right we we we [[01:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=6753.78s)]
*  We the city needs to make money [[01:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=6757.3s)]
*  We need 10 because everybody's guilty when they get pulled 99 percent of the time. Yes [[01:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=6758.66s)]
*  So is that a real thing? [[01:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=6763.54s)]
*  It's like hey, we got to make sure if you're if you're letting people off [[01:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=6764.34s)]
*  We can't let them off anymore the next month as far as like quotas and stuff like that [[01:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=6766.58s)]
*  No, they're too smart for that. This is how they do it. There there is no quotas [[01:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=6770.66s)]
*  But what they'll do is is they'll say you've got to be within five tickets of the team average the team being the watch [[01:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=6774.42s)]
*  It's going out. Okay [[01:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=6779.78s)]
*  So day watch is usually guys that have been on for a long time that just want to work nine to five monday through friday [[01:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=6780.82s)]
*  Those guys don't do shit. I mean they're doing the absolute minimum because they're burnt out. They're tired. They're old [[01:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=6786.179999999999s)]
*  Their tickets are going to be really super low [[01:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=6791.139999999999s)]
*  So what the department does is they'll take a guy fresh out of the academy [[01:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=6793.46s)]
*  You can't wait to write some tickets and they'll throw them on day watch [[01:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=6797.3s)]
*  So now that guy's writing 40 tickets fucking penmanship henry out there. Yeah, just doing it, you know for everything [[01:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=6800.98s)]
*  Yeah, so they'll put that guy on the watch and he'll write 40 tickets in a in a month [[01:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=6806.82s)]
*  Now the expectation is for everyone else has got to be at about 32 33 or you're gonna get [[01:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=6812.0199999999995s)]
*  On your eval. So is there a quota? No, there is no quota [[01:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=6818.099999999999s)]
*  We just got to be within the team average, which is the average that we should be at right again civil liability [[01:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=6821.94s)]
*  It's a way to beat around it. You know, I mean, that's what they'll do. That's how they'll they'll get the tickets they need [[01:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=6827.78s)]
*  Uh, let's get you another water. I gotta pee. Yeah. Yeah, I got p2 we can uh [[01:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=6833.54s)]

*  Right, they weren't they weren't there was no identifying it, but we started noticing that [[01:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=6971.46s)]
*  We would catch guys coming out of dentist office and they would they would have different kinds of containers [[01:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=6975.860000000001s)]
*  One of the ones that was real prevalent for some reason was these little square like lunch coolers [[01:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=6979.9400000000005s)]
*  And they'd have them filled with prescription bottles and we called them fishers and what they would do is they would go to these low end [[01:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=6984.580000000001s)]
*  Doctors dentists and they would just fill prescript find these doctors. They'll go. Oh my back hurts and they go. Okay [[01:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=6990.42s)]

*  We start going this is really becoming prevalent. We're finding this more and more [[01:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=7004.9s)]
*  And I think we actually had a guy od out front of a dentist office and somehow we [[01:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=7008.82s)]
*  We started to see this and we started to see this and we started to see this and we started to see this [[01:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=7014.34s)]
*  And we started to see this and we started to see this and we started to see this and we started to see this [[01:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=7017.78s)]
*  And we had a guy od out front of a dentist office and somehow we [[01:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=7020.74s)]
*  Found in his prescriptions that the prescription was from that dentist and that's how we kind of got turned on and it started going in motion [[01:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=7024.98s)]
*  It's finding out what what's going on here man is that these doctors somehow are making tremendous amounts of money [[01:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=7031.46s)]
*  Billing insurance by these guys coming in saying my knee hurts and then just do [[01:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=7037.38s)]
*  Giving a prescription right bill the insurance get a bunch of money knowing this guy's going to be back in about three days [[01:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=7042.099999999999s)]
*  I'm just gonna do it again. You know, I mean and these guys would go to like five six seven doctors [[01:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=7046.9s)]
*  Yeah, they had that documentary about a kid in new orleans. They got murdered [[01:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=7051.7s)]
*  buying some pills and it led to the dad like searching out this entire like [[01:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=7055.62s)]

*  Um, it was pretty fascinating though the pharmacist the pharmacist. That was it [[01:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=7067.219999999999s)]
*  I actually tried to reach out to that dad and even have him come on as a guest [[01:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=7071.62s)]
*  I mean it was the story is just so tragic, but then he busts he helps bust this [[01:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=7074.9s)]
*  doctor [[01:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=7081.2s)]
*  um [[01:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=7082.259999999999s)]
*  Who was I mean giving out insane amounts of pills every day [[01:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=7083.94s)]
*  They would show like they had like footage outside of her pharmacy or whatever and they have like 50 60 people out there [[01:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=7087.139999999999s)]
*  Just waiting at like at like up to like 1 a.m [[01:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=7093.139999999999s)]
*  And they have a security guard [[01:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=7095.86s)]
*  Uh like having them go in one at a time and she was just sitting in their writing scripts when they finally found her [[01:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=7097.62s)]
*  She was geeked out to the gills [[01:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=7102.339999999999s)]
*  Yeah, just insane. Um, was there ever instances where cops would start using the like in [[01:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=7104.099999999999s)]
*  To help relieve some of their own like ptsd and stuff that was going on that they ever [[01:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=7110.74s)]
*  Does that become an issue ever? Um [[01:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=7115.0599999999995s)]
*  I'm trying to think firsthand if I I know any I don't really [[01:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=7118.0199999999995s)]
*  I mean drinking there was always guys that always drank but that's always been socially acceptable. Yeah, that's pretty normal [[01:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=7122.099999999999s)]
*  Yeah, i'm just thinking if it yeah, because those opiate those opiates [[01:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=7127.139999999999s)]
*  The opioids it's such an easy thing to just take and use, you know [[01:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=7129.78s)]
*  it's a good example that you were saying like and I this is one i'm kind of reluctant because I don't want to cause any [[01:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=7134.42s)]
*  problems for people in police work right now, but [[01:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=7139.62s)]
*  Polling from general society police departments are staffed by people from the community [[01:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=7142.34s)]
*  They go through a hiring process and they get oh, yeah, we get everything and this is a good example of [[01:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=7146.66s)]
*  People judging the cops based on the actions of one person or a dozen or so [[01:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=7151.62s)]
*  We actually at my police department had two different cops one I worked with forever one I knew right off the bat [[01:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=7155.78s)]
*  That were child molesters. Damn that we found out there were child. As a matter of fact the one officer [[01:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=7163.46s)]
*  that um [[01:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=7169.78s)]
*  That we caught the first one [[01:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=7171.06s)]
*  He molested the son of one of our other officers. They were best friends [[01:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=7172.900000000001s)]
*  So again, you're talking about a situation where the world goes. We can't even have one bad cop [[01:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=7177.06s)]
*  Well, fuck we're with you on you know, not right we're with you but we're also this piece of a piece of society [[01:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=7181.78s)]
*  We're dealing with it too. Yeah, you know, we're dealing with it too as soon as we find out that's there [[01:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=7187.06s)]
*  I mean we we obviously this guy was gone in prison and we [[01:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=7190.58s)]
*  we handled that situation but um [[01:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=7195.3s)]
*  We're no different than anybody else, you know cops are no different [[01:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=7198.66s)]
*  The people that are cops are no different than anybody else as far as yeah [[02:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=7201.14s)]
*  It's kind of funny if you took a group of guys and you just showed me a group of guys [[02:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=7203.78s)]
*  I don't know if I'd know if they were cops or not unless you put the uniforms on them, you know [[02:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=7207.78s)]
*  Certain ones right some guys. Yeah, some guys got the high and tight and the big mustache and you know [[02:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=7211.46s)]
*  They're always wearing a fanny pack. Yeah, but you know what? So, yeah, right as soon as you see that guy though even [[02:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=7216.18s)]
*  Even cops look at that guy and go like dude, you're mowing your fucking lawn put your gun away, you know [[02:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=7221.9400000000005s)]
*  Cop it down a little. Yeah, totally. Yeah, totally [[02:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=7226.1s)]
*  Yeah, and those are the guys that end up being 23 years old and going to the nightclub with a gun on them, right? [[02:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=7229.7s)]
*  You know what I mean? Which is just like i'm a cop. Yeah. Yeah, I mean how stupid can you be? [[02:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=7236.099999999999s)]
*  You know, how stupid can you be going into a drinking situation? [[02:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=7240.9s)]
*  Carrying a gun because if someone punches you in the face, what are you gonna do? Yeah punch them with a bullet [[02:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=7244.259999999999s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, that's where you see stuff like that gun them. Yeah for sure [[02:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=7248.82s)]
*  Um, there was a couple of what do you think about this? [[02:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=7252.74s)]
*  So when you get in when you got into detectiveing did you detective anything like this? [[02:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=7255.7s)]
*  Idaho murder do you follow that kind of stuff? Do you follow crimes sometimes like especially high profile? No, I don't think um [[02:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=7260.0199999999995s)]
*  I I don't even want to know about it. But uh high profile most of my murders were domestic and gang related [[02:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=7266.259999999999s)]
*  Okay, where I was at I didn't have anything particularly high profile [[02:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=7271.62s)]
*  um, I had a lot of [[02:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=7276.98s)]
*  domestic situations which [[02:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=7279.62s)]
*  real quick on one, um [[02:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=7282.259999999999s)]
*  This is a good example for you too for hotels. I'll give you a little information on hotels [[02:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=7284.66s)]
*  You never know what goes on in hotels man any hotel room you're in [[02:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=7289.46s)]
*  I'm gonna give you a little touch of some stuff that goes on in those hotels before you you checked in [[02:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=7292.98s)]
*  We had a situation on a murder where a guy got arrested for domestic violence. Okay [[02:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=7297.78s)]
*  Taken into custody for whatever reason the judge sentenced him to 90 days [[02:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=7302.98s)]
*  But decided he's going to give him 24 hours to get his affairs in order before he reports to go into custody [[02:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=7307.14s)]
*  Which is nuts, which is totally totally nuts [[02:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=7313.86s)]
*  So he releases this guy this guy immediately goes and kidnaps the girl that he beat [[02:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=7317.46s)]
*  Takes her to a hotel in our city [[02:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=7321.860000000001s)]
*  In the hotel he executes her shoots her in the back of the head. She falls on the bed and then blows his head off [[02:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=7324.900000000001s)]
*  He actually puts it up to his thing. So he's on the ceiling [[02:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=7331.38s)]
*  um his [[02:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=7334.58s)]
*  The brains everything on the ceiling [[02:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=7335.62s)]
*  so when we get a [[02:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=7336.820000000001s)]
*  Cleaning lady tried to get in because he had put a table against the door and sees it calls us [[02:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=7338.18s)]
*  So we get there we push open the door [[02:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=7341.9400000000005s)]
*  And enough time had passed where the woman had fallen onto the bed [[02:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=7344.66s)]
*  It was one of those cheap polyester type bedspreads [[02:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=7348.66s)]
*  and it it's almost holds water so when she bled out it it [[02:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=7352.9s)]

*  Man, really you usually found a meth lab a lot of the times you would discover a meth lab because it'd blow up [[02:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=7490.0199999999995s)]
*  Because those are volatile. They blew up all the time. You can't shoot in there [[02:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=7494.98s)]

*  I'm not a marijuana advocate, but I identified really quick that this is ridiculous [[02:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=7545.94s)]
*  That this is against the law every single person I ever came in contact that was stoned never gave me a problem at all [[02:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=7549.7s)]

*  Why do we have those laws against marijuana? [[02:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=7571.139999999999s)]
*  because I [[02:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=7574.0199999999995s)]
*  Old white people, you know back in the day. Yeah, just hysteria. They didn't [[02:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=7575.86s)]
*  They didn't know what it was. They didn't understand. So I don't know. I don't know why but the devils led us or whatever [[02:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=7580.66s)]
*  All that shit, but we're getting better. California is good. The rest of world's getting better [[02:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=7585.0599999999995s)]
*  I I really believe they should be legal everywhere for sure 100 [[02:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=7588.74s)]
*  But drugs as far as drug goes heroin addicts, they do heroin they stay home. They nod out right pills stay home [[02:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=7592.58s)]
*  You know marijuana the fun [[02:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=7599.139999999999s)]

*  And it's always at night, you know, that's when we get to work [[02:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=7612.18s)]
*  We would find tweakers. They had all these different processes of how they get their money copper was a real big one [[02:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=7614.820000000001s)]
*  They love copper. They would wipe out whole [[02:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=7620.900000000001s)]
*  Housing tracks, you know their copper [[02:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=7623.62s)]
*  But you'd get the occasional one which I had one [[02:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=7625.62s)]
*  Actually, I think I had two where they would go into industrial complexes and they would go into these massive warehouses that had those giant [[02:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=7628.0199999999995s)]
*  metal cabinets that had the [[02:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=7635.299999999999s)]
*  the what like 10 wires that were coming down it that were like [[02:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=7637.299999999999s)]
*  20 inch in diameter, you know, I mean just massive fiber optic wires and all that [[02:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=7642.42s)]
*  No, there was just like electricity [[02:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=7646.42s)]
*  There was like a box where the main electricity would come in and it would all branch off that but inside there there'd be massive wiring [[02:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=7648.0199999999995s)]
*  And these fuckers would go in there and they'd try to cut that wiring out and be live [[02:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=7654.339999999999s)]
*  So it would cook them dude. I mean it would just they would instantly just get electrocuted [[02:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=7658.5s)]
*  and [[02:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=7663.0599999999995s)]
*  Either a fire or there would be different ways that it would that we become aware of it that we get there [[02:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=7663.86s)]
*  But by the time you go out there these guys would be onion rings [[02:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=7669.139999999999s)]
*  I mean onion rings because they've just been flowing through them flowing through and what do they start to look like kind of like a [[02:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=7672.339999999999s)]
*  J like a jerky do they start to look like uh burnt completely totally burnt? Yeah completely [[02:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=7677.62s)]
*  Does it almost they almost look fake? Yes, a lot of that shit looks fake a lot of the stuff [[02:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=7683.459999999999s)]
*  That's really brutal. I had an industrial accident where a guy got sucked into a turbine [[02:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=7687.94s)]
*  It was a big giant piece of machinery that had this [[02:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=7692.339999999999s)]
*  Like shaft that was a spinning shaft that came out of the engine and it was about I don't know about [[02:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=7695.459999999999s)]
*  Four feet off three feet off the ground i'd say and it ran to another [[02:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=7700.58s)]
*  Engine of some type and they had that covered with [[02:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=7704.9s)]
*  metal like gates so [[02:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=7708.66s)]
*  That things metal no one could touch it and it was in the front [[02:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=7712.18s)]
*  Well, these guys in the warehouse were playing football [[02:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=7714.9800000000005s)]
*  And the dude threw the football and he missed it and it went into where those things were [[02:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=7717.54s)]
*  So this dumbass decided to step over the gate where those things are spending a billion miles an hour [[02:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=7722.1s)]
*  To get the football and the sweater he had tied around his waist got sucked into it and it taffied him [[02:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=7726.74s)]
*  It sucked him into the piston and and wrapped him around it [[02:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=7733.46s)]
*  And by the time he was completely wrapped up into it [[02:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=7737.219999999999s)]
*  His head had been hitting the concrete so many times that it was going around that it emptied his insides [[02:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=7741.0599999999995s)]
*  Perfectly, so it was on the ceiling on the back wall and then shot across the thing [[02:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=7748.16s)]
*  So when we got there they they weren't such a panic. They hadn't even shut off the machinery [[02:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=7753.299999999999s)]
*  So this thing was going [[02:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=7757.139999999999s)]
*  And you're hearing this guy's head [[02:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=7758.74s)]
*  Not think think think think think by then it was like a wet noodle, you know a giant wet noodle [[02:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=7761.379999999999s)]
*  Just disgusting dude, and you told them, you know, why would you turn this off and they they're you know, they made sense [[02:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=7765.78s)]
*  No, we didn't we don't want to see it. We don't want to stop. We don't want to see it [[02:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=7771.860000000001s)]
*  We don't know what to do [[02:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=7775.06s)]
*  So when you turn that thing off and you see that dude wrapped up in there and the fact that dude [[02:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=7776.42s)]
*  You want to talk about fake? You know what I mean? I mean it looked totally fake [[02:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=7780.74s)]
*  It didn't look like a human being at all and cops have to respond to that [[02:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=7784.18s)]
*  Oh, yeah [[02:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=7787.9400000000005s)]
*  Anything that happens like that any industrial cops are always the first on everything because firemen are at the station playing video games [[02:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=7788.58s)]
*  Yeah, utter having hot dogs. Oh, yeah, dude. I went I used to date a fireman's daughter [[02:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=7795.219999999999s)]

*  Oh god firemen are gonna hate me. They do see all the tragedy and death [[02:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=7834.42s)]
*  Which is brutal and I I feel for them in that but the other side of it is is that everybody loves them [[02:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=7838.900000000001s)]
*  Yeah, because all they're doing is saving and helping and everything that they do essentially is science, you know [[02:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=7845.06s)]
*  I mean, it's a fire if it comes in contact with that. We know what's gonna happen. The wind's blowing this way [[02:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=7851.06s)]
*  We know what's gonna happen. It's all pretty predictable. It's not that there's aspects that are dangerous, but you know, yeah you guys are there's a lot more [[02:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=7854.900000000001s)]

*  Yes, there's not like a lot of even house fires. If there's a house fire cops are always the first ones on it [[02:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=7868.34s)]
*  Dude, I'd shoot if I saw a cop a house fire. I'd damn shoot at it [[02:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=7873.06s)]

*  Public image, you know [[02:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=7974.02s)]
*  Um it yeah, I seen bad public image is not doing it justice the biggest [[02:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=7976.1s)]
*  biggest issues for police right now [[02:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=7981.14s)]
*  First and foremost it always has been but they're now just starting to acknowledge it and talk about it and and get real programs in place [[02:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=7983.780000000001s)]
*  Number one killer of cops is suicide. Yeah, that's a weird statement to say [[02:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=7991.139999999999s)]
*  But like like I I got a guy that I worked with who's in texas right now [[02:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=7994.66s)]
*  He's he's working in a program a religious program that reaches out and helps cops and firemen and first responders with mental wellness [[02:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=7998.82s)]

*  You know, you just don't hear about that because it's bad publicity cops don't even want that out [[02:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=8021.0599999999995s)]
*  You know, it's a scary thing when someone says oh cops are all killing themselves. Wow. All the cops are unstable [[02:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=8025.22s)]
*  There just is no good publicity for cops, you know, so and what's happened recently [[02:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=8029.86s)]
*  What happened this last time? [[02:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=8036.26s)]
*  with the uh the riots and the the political aspect that got involved and allowed it to continue in the way it was [[02:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=8038.66s)]
*  Put on the media and portrayed [[02:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=8047.0599999999995s)]
*  It's it's it's set us back a lot. It's set policing back a lot. It's it's cops are scared to do their job [[02:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=8049.620000000001s)]
*  You know, they're just scared to do their job. They didn't I can imagine. I can't even imagine [[02:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=8058.580000000001s)]
*  Yeah, the public doesn't understand, you know, it's when a guy comes [[02:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=8062.26s)]
*  It's it's difficult to describe but it's life and death, you know cops shouldn't have to die just because [[02:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=8066.5s)]
*  You know that the people want the fight to be fair there is no fight here [[02:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=8074.5s)]
*  My job is to get him in custody and take him before magistrate. That's it [[02:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=8078.34s)]
*  Right and I gotta do what I gotta do to get him in custody. But if this guy's fighting me the way he is [[02:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=8081.7s)]
*  He'll kill [[02:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=8086.0199999999995s)]
*  I have to I have to think he'll kill me to get away. I have no choice [[02:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=8087.3s)]
*  Yeah, especially if a guy that's already killed other people are done thing. You know, this is a bad guy [[02:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=8091.54s)]
*  It's not a good guy. Yes, who's here on the ground. It's like this ain't a great guy [[02:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=8095.94s)]

*  This is somebody who has is been doing crime [[02:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=8105.62s)]
*  Um, how big is race becoming history? I was just gonna say is that where it gets to? [[02:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=8108.900000000001s)]
*  Um, is that is that like be it become a big problem? I can only give you my experience, right? [[02:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=8113.06s)]
*  So i'm only speaking for me [[02:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=8118.1s)]
*  I I worked at two different police departments in the two police departments [[02:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=8119.06s)]
*  I worked in one of the communities was predominantly black was south central. The other one was predominantly hispanic hispanic white [[02:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=8122.18s)]
*  You know a little bit of everything [[02:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=8128.02s)]
*  um [[02:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=8129.94s)]
*  Systemat the statement that the police are systematically racist [[02:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=8131.7s)]
*  I know for 100% is not true [[02:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=8136.82s)]
*  because [[02:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=8138.9s)]
*  I was part of the police. I was part of these two police departments and [[02:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=8140.179999999999s)]
*  If it was there, I tell you did I see it? I absolutely [[02:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=8145.219999999999s)]
*  I absolutely did I in my entire career in the field? [[02:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=8149.299999999999s)]
*  I saw two guys that I felt like that guy is treating that person different based on the color of his skin [[02:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=8152.74s)]
*  Okay, it's not too bad over the whole course of it the whole course one guy was blatant [[02:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=8159.38s)]
*  He was blatant, you know, I mean and they actually got rid of him relatively quick [[02:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=8162.98s)]
*  Um, the other guy wasn't as blatant, but it did appear that way [[02:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=8166.82s)]
*  What is the reality of it is is that when you work in a community? [[02:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=8171.0599999999995s)]
*  Usually that community is it's predominantly something. Oh, yeah [[02:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=8175.54s)]
*  It's predominantly something and it's not that you because in my experience in my police departments [[02:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=8180.34s)]
*  I worked with black guys hispanic guys asian guys. We were everything everything with women, you know, especially california [[02:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=8185.0599999999995s)]
*  Yes, everything was represented [[02:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=8190.74s)]
*  and within those walls [[02:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=8192.74s)]
*  There was [[02:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=8195.14s)]
*  It didn't matter. You know what I mean? If it if it if it did exist it was something that we did [[02:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=8196.58s)]
*  with amongst each other in jest, right like [[02:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=8202.1s)]
*  The guy that I work with was black ripping on me because some [[02:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=8206.26s)]
*  Stereo stupid stereotype about white people or whatever, you know, it's something we would do and joke about [[02:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=8209.279999999999s)]
*  But I never saw anyone treat anyone any different because of the color of skin [[02:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=8213.779999999999s)]
*  Unfortunately, what would happen is is that you'd be in these communities and you would develop [[02:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=8218.48s)]
*  I don't even like to use the word prejudice, but you would develop [[02:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=8223.46s)]
*  um [[02:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=8226.82s)]
*  Feelings about the way these communities operate because you're constantly [[02:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=8228.019999999999s)]
*  Coming in contact with the worst of it, right? You know, I mean constantly in any scenario [[02:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=8233.38s)]
*  Right if i'm working in an all black community all or predominantly black probably latino community [[02:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=8239.22s)]

*  Yes [[02:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=8248.74s)]
*  Yes [[02:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=8249.14s)]
*  You're dealing with the bad guys and you start to develop over years and years and years of the same and and there are [[02:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=8249.3s)]
*  There are unique aspects to different types of communities, you know [[02:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=8256.099999999999s)]
*  The crimes and the way the things that people do in hispanic community are are different than the black community different to the white community [[02:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=8259.539999999999s)]
*  Different in the asian community. So there are things that go on that are repetitive [[02:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=8264.9s)]
*  Where you start getting callous towards it? So it wasn't a matter of [[02:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=8269.06s)]
*  people being [[02:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=8273.699999999999s)]

*  the hispanic community [[02:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=8291.779999999999s)]
*  Is really divided up. There's first generation hispanics. There's second jay's race and they're very different within themselves like a first generation hispanic people to come here [[02:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=8293.699999999999s)]

*  You know [[02:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=8316.42s)]
*  They would get together for quinceanera and you'd get calls at three o'clock in the morning and they're all beating the shit out of each [[02:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=8316.66s)]
*  Other because they're all so drunk, you know [[02:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=8321.699999999999s)]

*  Why are you guys drunk and it's three o'clock in the morning, but it was prevalent so you would get callous towards that [[02:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=8327.94s)]
*  Oh, yeah. Yeah, and it's fun getting fucked up around a kid. Sometimes, you know if you're unless it's getting real weird [[02:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=8332.82s)]
*  Yeah, you know, well, there's a lot of that too, but in every community that I dealt with [[02:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=8337.86s)]
*  You would have that and people will start identifying stuff and things would start [[02:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=8342.980000000001s)]
*  Becoming you would develop calluses towards it, right? [[02:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=8347.36s)]
*  systematic racism some of this you never thought you had you never saw man and when they say that it's so frustrating because [[02:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=8350.980000000001s)]

*  There's no reason why that guy didn't after [[02:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=8386.42s)]
*  10 to 15 seconds stand up and put try to put that guy back into the car, right? [[02:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=8389.78s)]
*  So what he started doing and in the world insinuated that guy's racist [[02:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=8396.02s)]
*  Well, we don't know if that had anything to do with the color of that guy's skin [[02:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=8401.220000000001s)]
*  All we do know is is that guy crossed the line and should [[02:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=8404.740000000002s)]
*  Face consequences because he started administering punishment [[02:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=8408.820000000002s)]
*  At the where he was at and that is not his job [[02:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=8413.88s)]
*  His job was in in the custody and even if in his thought process his intent was not to administer punishment [[02:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=8416.84s)]
*  he should know better than to [[02:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=8423.0s)]
*  Put hit be in that situation for any length of time because it can cause harm that guy was wrong, right? [[02:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=8426.68s)]
*  but to insinuate that it was race-based and if i'm I didn't watch it, but [[02:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=8432.92s)]
*  I don't think anything ever even came out where this there's ever anything in this guy's background where there was [[02:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=8438.44s)]
*  Any instance of racism whatsoever? Yeah, yet if you go to ask anyone right now, they're gonna say [[02:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=8442.92s)]
*  Oh, that was racist cops are racist, right? We have no idea that that it could have been [[02:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=8447.960000000001s)]
*  Could have been you know, we'd have to be intimately involved. I imagine if there was any proof of that [[02:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=8452.12s)]
*  They would have put it out everywhere. Yeah, if they had found something it would have been everywhere [[02:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=8455.960000000001s)]
*  well, it's interesting now too because almost the race narrative is starting to just it's starting to [[02:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=8459.48s)]
*  Evaporate over time because and I think in some communities obviously in the south there's a ton of that over, you know [[02:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=8464.18s)]
*  there's historical like [[02:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=8469.72s)]
*  Biases and like [[02:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=8471.779999999999s)]
*  Black people didn't have opportunities or money. They had to do what they could to survive [[02:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=8473.96s)]
*  Yes, you know and then you have cops who were predominantly white probably and they [[02:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=8478.84s)]
*  They were policing crimes and crime is a lot of times things you have to use to survive, you know [[02:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=8483.32s)]
*  Certainly like at times in the past, you know [[02:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=8487.64s)]
*  But it's interesting that uh [[02:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=8491.56s)]
*  Shoot were we talking about? What did you say racism? Yeah, so it's interesting that yeah [[02:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=8494.679999999998s)]
*  Because now it's like police forces are getting pretty diverse super [[02:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=8498.76s)]
*  Right, and so i've almost wondered would it be better to have a policeman of that ethnicity? [[02:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=8502.44s)]
*  Show up. Absolutely, you know, and they're all starting to go towards that. Yeah, they are my police department is [[02:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=8509.64s)]
*  When I started predominantly white when I left it's getting predominantly hispanics. Yeah, and I think that's smart [[02:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=8515.800000000001s)]
*  I think it's it's it's actually smart. Does it make it a little harder for the guy that's white that wants to get it? [[02:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=8521.960000000001s)]
*  Get a job, you know, what is this gonna have to find a different community? I guess you know, but yeah, it's it's it's [[02:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=8526.36s)]
*  Definitely going in that direction and it's yeah, it's almost like they should have it. It's like, okay, we have [[02:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=8531.480000000001s)]
*  You know, uh two white suspects and two black suspects. Let's send a black police officer and a white police officer [[02:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=8536.2s)]
*  You know if you unfortunately in police work, you don't have that time to go [[02:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=8542.84s)]
*  I guess a dispatcher could right they would know based on what what they have out there of who to send to what [[02:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=8546.36s)]
*  But again, you're policing specific areas [[02:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=8551.640000000001s)]
*  It would be harder than you think right and it's crazy that we're having to even think about that kind of stuff, right? [[02:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=8554.199999999999s)]
*  but it's like you get so many like civil lawsuits and so many it's just like [[02:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=8560.119999999999s)]
*  We've just taxed ourselves at the fucking guilt. You know, it's like we've [[02:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=8564.92s)]
*  I don't even think that would from my experience. That's not even a cure-all. Well, yeah, we will and I think it's a good move [[02:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=8569.96s)]
*  But it's not a cure-all because i've seen i've been in at scenes where a guy I was with was black officer [[02:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=8576.359999999999s)]
*  And i've seen people attack him just like they were attacking me what I mean because it wasn't really about [[02:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=8582.039999999999s)]
*  They hated that guy because of the uniform [[02:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=8588.279999999999s)]
*  I mean that guy that with my name tag be white [[02:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=8590.199999999999s)]
*  He didn't know who I was he the way he was attacking me and all that [[02:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=8592.279999999999s)]
*  It was my uniform and the fact on top of it that I was white but I see them do the same thing [[02:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=8595.64s)]
*  It's just they don't like the police. They just don't like the police. There's just certain people that don't like the police [[02:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=8600.84s)]
*  you know, yeah, and I think it's interesting too because it's like some cultures like black culture never really had a like [[02:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=8606.039999999999s)]
*  America was always kind of a kind of a white culture country probably [[02:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=8611.72s)]
*  You know, I mean it was there was diversity for sure [[02:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=8616.599999999999s)]
*  but I think like the people that ran the country were probably [[02:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=8619.4s)]
*  Predominantly white probably probably so then I think a lot of society kind of has a white [[02:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=8624.34s)]
*  Ring to it. So I think only now are you seeing a lot more? [[02:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=8630.439999999999s)]
*  um [[02:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=8635.32s)]
*  Society getting really pretty diverse, you know [[02:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=8636.599999999999s)]
*  So I think you're starting to see what these other cultures how what they even like to have in society or what they like [[02:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=8638.6s)]
*  Their societies to be like yes, and so I think you're seeing like a merging of that like some societies [[02:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=8644.68s)]
*  They might not like [[02:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=8649.56s)]
*  to have any [[02:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=8651.16s)]
*  Rules or any policing there? They you know some they think that they think that right? [[02:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=8652.76s)]
*  Oh, yeah, they think that they think that but they if you took the police out of some certain communities [[02:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=8657.960000000001s)]
*  Communities that have more problems if you completely took the police out of it and they knew the police [[02:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=8663.56s)]
*  They would implode it would be there would there would be no community [[02:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=8668.519999999999s)]
*  Wow, it would be no community because criminals are going to be criminals, you know [[02:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=8671.96s)]
*  People are going to they're going to feed on the weak knowing that there's nothing there to stop them. They're going to get theirs [[02:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=8676.039999999999s)]
*  Wow at any extent the police [[02:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=8680.76s)]
*  Policing is completely totally necessary how we how we do it is just going to continue to evolve. Yeah, you know, but it's right now [[02:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=8683.96s)]
*  It's it's good. There's a good basis in place [[02:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=8692.84s)]
*  What's happening to them is totally unfair [[02:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=8696.84s)]
*  But we just got to get through this and good will come of this amen [[02:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=8700.44s)]
*  It's unfortunate, you know, but good will come of this good came of rodney king great things came with the rodney king incident [[02:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=8703.08s)]
*  It really I saw it. I lived it. I watched the change. Oh, absolutely when I first started [[02:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=8708.28s)]
*  There was a lot of stuff that went on that slowly I watched it get you know [[02:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=8713.0s)]
*  When you're when you're new you just kind of stand back [[02:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=8717.08s)]
*  I watched it slowly get eliminated slowly get better things slowly improve on the way they handle stuff, you know [[02:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=8719.32s)]
*  Yeah, it's it's it's definitely getting better and and it's it's gonna get better that we have [[02:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=8725.32s)]
*  You know, I just I just hope they continue to be fair because there's a lot of good dudes that are just doing john [[02:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=8730.36s)]
*  Yeah, I think like i'm grateful for him, man. I'm really grateful for him [[02:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=8734.28s)]
*  Yeah, they they deal with a lot of they deal with a lot of stuff, you know [[02:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=8739.08s)]
*  Not it. Yeah, not everybody gets gets to not everybody sees this stuff, you know, nobody not everybody sees [[02:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=8742.28s)]
*  You know, I mean [[02:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=8749.08s)]
*  Try that once see how that changes your life [[02:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=8752.12s)]
*  I can't even imagine it really take one person and watch one time watch someone in front of them [[02:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=8754.28s)]
*  Blow their head off and then and then see how it changes do an experiment follow that guy around [[02:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=8759.88s)]
*  See how that changes life now take that guy that same guy and do it for 20 years every single day [[02:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=8764.04s)]
*  You know, what do you expect? [[02:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=8769.56s)]
*  You know, yeah [[02:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=8771.56s)]
*  I can't I lose it if somebody has left like a big thing a piece of chunk of hair like if they had a [[02:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=8772.2s)]
*  bunch of hair in the drain [[02:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=8776.92s)]
*  I would like yeah, I couldn't even that makes me nervous [[02:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=8778.84s)]
*  And probably the thought about it going back like give the example of that [[02:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=8783.64s)]
*  I watched the guy put a double bear shotgun in his mouth was when his mom was standing right beside him and blow his head off [[02:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=8787.4s)]
*  Yeah standing standing in the doorway. I remember back in the day in the older houses in wittier [[02:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=8791.960000000001s)]
*  They had those screen doors, you know the decorative stuff on the front [[02:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=8796.68s)]
*  It was a screen door. The mom came running out screaming. Hey my son my son [[02:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=8799.880000000001s)]
*  He's suicidal [[02:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=8803.4s)]
*  And she kind of got behind me by the car and I looked over at the house and the door was open the screen door [[02:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=8804.68s)]
*  Was there and the guy walked right up to the screen door. He had one of those old school double barrel shotguns [[02:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=8808.68s)]
*  Stuck it in his mouth and pulled the trigger [[02:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=8813.880000000001s)]
*  His his head expanded like a cartoon the gases [[02:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=8817.08s)]
*  Expanded his head. It was I can't I can't do justice in trying to get you to understand what it looked like [[02:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=8820.84s)]
*  Mom freaking out just the dynamics of that scenario that's not right there [[02:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=8826.44s)]
*  Then on top of it [[02:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=8830.6s)]
*  I had to go inside the house and i'm pushing the screen door to get this guy because he he basically los vegas [[02:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=8831.640000000001s)]
*  Hotel explosion [[02:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=8837.0s)]
*  Falled right in front of the door. So i'm trying to push him out of the way and it didn't even dawn on me as i'm pushing in [[02:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=8838.6s)]
*  His brain matter was on the scene. It fell into the back of my shirt [[02:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=8845.0s)]
*  Yeah [[02:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=8851.08s)]
*  Which to this day I can feel it, you know what I mean? And now this is this is one small scenario [[02:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=8852.68s)]
*  Imagine that happening to you one time [[02:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=8858.36s)]
*  How that would change the course of your life. I know it sounds dramatic, but don't you think it would yeah [[02:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=8861.0s)]
*  Don't you think it would look at a lot of stuff different? [[02:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=8864.84s)]
*  Don't you think you would feel a lot different? [[02:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=8867.320000000002s)]
*  So yeah, I don't know if I would keep being able to feel after a certain point, right? [[02:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=8869.800000000001s)]
*  Yeah, and then have to keep in that I had to keep that thing [[02:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=8873.480000000001s)]
*  I had to keep it in my shirt for like four hours [[02:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=8876.2s)]
*  Did we try to wash it out and all that but came down to take it off my shirt and vest and everything is [[02:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=8878.12s)]
*  But once [[02:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=8884.68s)]
*  Sorry, I was just gonna ask a question. Um [[02:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=8885.640000000001s)]
*  You mentioned all these violent situations, but you were a homicide detective. Was that fulfilling? Is it fulfilling like helping? [[02:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=8887.64s)]
*  No person. No, that was my least favorite. That was absolutely my least favorite assignment. It's the one homicide detective here. Yes [[02:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=8893.24s)]
*  Yes, uh, it's the one I it's the one I worked towards my whole career [[02:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=8900.599999999999s)]
*  And then once I got into it [[02:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=8904.68s)]
*  It was just there was no real satisfaction there was satisfaction in catching the person that did it but it was overshadowed [[02:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=8908.119999999999s)]
*  By what the act [[02:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=8915.58s)]
*  Left everyone around it in you know [[02:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=8917.74s)]
*  Again, I had domestic violence [[02:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=8920.78s)]
*  I had I I could I had a domestic violence situation that was I can say was gratifying and catching [[02:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=8923.02s)]
*  Who did it and such but a lot of the gang ones it just didn't matter [[02:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=8928.380000000001s)]
*  It just didn't matter. You know, you would catch the guy and he [[02:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=8931.820000000002s)]
*  Some someone else would do it or he'd get out and do it again and and there was so much sadness [[02:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=8935.18s)]
*  And sorrow surrounding it because the court cases were long and drawn out. Um, you were sitting with the family for [[02:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=8940.72s)]
*  For sometimes years getting through these processes and you were the last attachment that they had to these people [[02:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=8947.52s)]
*  So they would become really attached to you. They would bring me christmas presents [[02:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=8953.36s)]
*  You know even after the case was done and I would I would politely tell them I [[02:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=8957.119999999999s)]
*  I can't accept this for a lot of reasons [[02:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=8961.52s)]
*  But the primary one is is I I can't have this relationship [[02:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=8964.08s)]
*  I can't have this emotional tie to you because I got a million more of these and if I start doing that [[02:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=8968.16s)]
*  I'm done. You know, I mean this has to be [[02:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=8973.52s)]
*  You have to be [[02:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=8976.16s)]
*  Your groceries that I bagged and you got to take that bag of groceries and you got to get out of here [[02:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=8977.52s)]
*  Because I got to get on to the next one and it's just it's it's too much mentally to have an emotional tie with you whatsoever [[02:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=8981.44s)]
*  So homicide was a lot of that [[02:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=8988.24s)]
*  And it was also hard. I mean, that's it has to be heartbreaking heartbreaking because it's heartbreaking to them too [[02:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=8990.32s)]
*  It's like even when it was a gang member even when it was a gang member that was killed that was a brutal murderer himself [[02:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=8994.96s)]
*  He had a mom and I was always in contact with that mom, you know what I mean? And and [[02:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=9000.56s)]
*  It just it would just [[02:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=9004.96s)]
*  It was almost impossible to deal with and i'm i'm a little [[02:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=9007.039999999999s)]
*  I admit it man going into it. I'm a little too sensitive [[02:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=9010.88s)]
*  To have probably done this job, but it was just draining man [[02:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=9013.359999999999s)]
*  There's no good scenario in homicide and then if you don't catch the guys that did it [[02:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=9016.48s)]
*  It weighs it weighs on you it weighs on you that you couldn't you couldn't do it, you know [[02:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=9020.96s)]
*  You couldn't figure it out. You failed this guy's gonna do it again. So there's almost a level of [[02:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=9026.0s)]
*  Responsibility that is homicide was a different beast. I I [[02:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=9031.34s)]
*  No bueno, man, no good, you know [[02:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=9036.16s)]
*  There I got a lot of good things out of other assignments. Do you think there's a lot of serial killers out there still? [[02:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=9038.56s)]
*  Serial killers depends on your definition of a serial killer seems hard to do now [[02:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=9044.96s)]
*  Well, if your definition of a serial killer is someone that kills a lot of people yeah [[02:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=9049.279999999999s)]
*  Yeah, there is there's gang members that there's gang members out there [[02:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=9053.599999999999s)]
*  They've killed five six seven people and they're gonna kill more people [[02:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=9056.48s)]
*  But the world doesn't look at that guy as a serial killer [[02:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=9059.279999999999s)]
*  It doesn't fit the definition or if you go to a training class, they're not teaching you that this guy is a serial killer [[02:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=9061.599999999999s)]
*  You know what I mean? Yeah [[02:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=9067.679999999998s)]
*  The quintessential serial killer is so uncommon [[02:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=9069.279999999999s)]
*  Yeah, so so so uncommon. It's just nobody's [[02:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=9073.519999999999s)]
*  Breaking into home strangers homes and you know doing the night stalker shit [[02:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=9078.72s)]
*  Is there a hypothesis that when you get into that job that that'll be what it's like and stuff [[02:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=9084.08s)]
*  Is there that kind of like kind of kind of you know, and it's like anything when you look I mean I'm I [[02:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=9088.72s)]
*  In an industry like this, I imagine you look at someone that's doing something else and going like oh, that's right [[02:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=9095.04s)]
*  Oh, yeah, you think that's where I want to be [[02:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=9099.12s)]
*  That's why I want to be because that's where it's happening then you get there and you go fuck this ain't that great [[02:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=9100.48s)]

*  I want to be there and no matter what you get there and you go like [[02:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=9106.08s)]
*  At least my experiences. It's not what I thought it was. It was actually better back there [[02:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=9109.36s)]
*  I want to go back there because that was a lot better this this but homicide [[02:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=9113.12s)]
*  I mean look at the infatuation with cops look at my tv shows and movies. It's insane everything everything killing [[02:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=9116.88s)]

*  That dude's been around [[02:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=9143.6s)]

*  Again, it goes back to that thing is you just don't get it [[02:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=9160.08s)]
*  You know what I mean? Homicide is where you want to get but when you get there [[02:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=9162.48s)]

*  Strictly based on experience and compassion, you know of understanding the dynamic of taking away someone's freedom is a big fucking deal [[02:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=9353.04s)]
*  And we need to avoid that at all costs [[02:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=9360.24s)]
*  We need to avoid that at all costs then getting them in the system and and getting this record and all the things that come with it [[02:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=9362.96s)]

*  And putting them in a jail cell and realizing this is going to change the course of your life [[02:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=9385.36s)]
*  Forever, you know, hopefully it'll be positive, but this is they would be crying and it was just traumatic. It was just traumatic most cops [[02:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=9390.0s)]

*  I'm not gonna remember sitting in thinking like talking to them in this cell and just going like it's gonna be okay [[02:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=9406.720000000001s)]
*  Right, it's gonna be okay. I know you hate me right now, but it's it's gonna be okay [[02:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=9411.36s)]
*  And and you're one thing I do know [[02:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=9415.36s)]
*  I hope is you're never going to be here again, right and you didn't kill nobody, you know [[02:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=9417.68s)]
*  I mean so those kind of aspects for me. I really look back at and go like [[02:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=9422.320000000002s)]
*  I I was meant to be there [[02:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=9427.12s)]
*  As as much as I didn't deserve maybe to be there and the way it just happened to me to be there [[02:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=9429.36s)]
*  We'll be able to share this story today too with us too, you know, because yeah, like I feel too much [[02:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=9435.2s)]
*  I've always been too much of a feeler, you know [[02:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=9439.76s)]
*  And so I think you need people that have a little extra feeling sometimes to get out of instances [[02:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=9441.92s)]
*  Sometimes and share, you know share some of the feeling side of it and i'll be especially your job [[02:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=9446.960000000001s)]
*  I'll be judged i'll be judged based on this from people in the industry people in the industry will absolutely judge me based on [[02:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=9451.68s)]
*  This is literally believe it or not. This is the absolute first fucking time [[02:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=9456.960000000001s)]
*  I have ever publicly said anything about my childhood and being arrested and being in custody [[02:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=9460.64s)]
*  I worked with guys who are my friends who I care deeply about [[02:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=9466.880000000001s)]
*  And I never made mention of it and so much time went on [[02:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=9470.72s)]
*  I just thought it's irrelevant and there's no reason to bring it up and I just never did I just buried it [[02:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=9473.6s)]
*  This is the absolute first fucking time i've ever made that and it'll be interesting. I don't know [[02:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=9478.4s)]
*  Who's gonna see it or what? It'll be interesting to see what i'm an old guy now, you know [[02:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=9482.8s)]
*  It's be interesting to see if people actually come back at me and go you motherfucker or whatever it is the reaction [[02:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=9487.039999999999s)]
*  I get fucking criminal, but I do hope that people do listen to it and go like hey [[02:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=9491.6s)]
*  What's there's something to it. It's fascinating man, and it's fascinating [[02:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=9496.24s)]
*  You know, we had a border patrol security guy on one time and um [[02:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=9498.96s)]
*  Which is just a public service job [[02:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=9503.279999999999s)]
*  I guess you know in a way or some something in the same world a little bit [[02:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=9504.88s)]
*  Yes [[02:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=9508.08s)]
*  But it was interesting to hear about the border and the things that go on there and the people that are getting run back and forth [[02:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=9508.48s)]
*  Across there and how cartels own different pieces of land there [[02:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=9513.439999999999s)]
*  So if you even want to transport someone across a piece of land [[02:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=9516.8s)]
*  You have to pay that cartel even to like coyote somebody across the land [[02:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=9519.919999999998s)]
*  Yeah, and how a lot of the people coming in some of them aren't even mexican [[02:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=9524.4s)]
*  Yeah, and a lot of them are fucking you know, uh [[02:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=9528.08s)]
*  Middle eastern and they're fucking a lot of pedophile a lot of creatures shit was like jesus christ [[02:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=9531.92s)]
*  There's a lot of aspects to that that you don't even think of that [[02:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=9536.960000000001s)]
*  We dealt with on a daily basis a lot of people that come in [[02:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=9539.44s)]
*  Are obviously coming here because they want a better life totally down for that, you know, there's just a process [[02:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=9542.48s)]
*  We just need the process just do it the legal process come everybody come but let's just go through this process because we need that process [[02:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=9546.48s)]
*  Because you wouldn't believe how many people come here and they don't have the means or they just like they don't have car insurance, right? [[02:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=9553.599999999999s)]
*  They don't they're all these different things that they're just bypassing [[02:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=9559.279999999999s)]
*  Where it's causing such turmoil in our world in our system, you know, I mean those those are the problems [[02:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=9562.48s)]
*  Well all of that it's all like how long are we going to strain the the walls of our system? [[02:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=9568.08s)]
*  You know, I mean we already don't even you know, and then it's still expect people [[02:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=9572.24s)]
*  To put a president on television and be like america, you know, it's like [[02:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=9577.759999999998s)]
*  Don't sell me this fucking thing if you're not, uh [[02:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=9581.119999999999s)]
*  If it's not a real product, right? Yeah, and that's what's really kind of happened [[02:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=9586.24s)]
*  I think it's that's a lot of kind of what's you know, it's one of the issues they bag it up into one thing [[02:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=9590.32s)]
*  You know if you're against it, they say well, you're racist. Yeah, i'm not a racist at all [[02:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=9596.56s)]
*  I couldn't give a shit. The only reason that I even think about is because you keep talking about it [[02:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=9599.92s)]
*  But I just want them to come here. I want them here. Let's make sure they have a path to get here [[02:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=9603.519999999999s)]
*  Oh, yeah, let's just just follow the rules to get here. That's it [[02:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=9609.119999999999s)]
*  We have to have roll call you have to have like if you don't know [[02:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=9612.08s)]
*  Inventory any business that doesn't have good inventory will go out of business [[02:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=9614.939999999999s)]
*  If you don't have know what's on the shelves or know what's here or what's there? [[02:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=9618.32s)]
*  It's going to go out of business, man [[02:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=9621.519999999999s)]
*  And that's what fucking starts to get scary because you have other people that are like well I was born here [[02:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=9622.8s)]
*  I'm just trying to play by whatever rules I was born into maybe they were more fortunate than some other places [[02:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=9627.279999999999s)]
*  I don't know in some ways. They probably were in some ways. They probably weren't [[02:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=9632.16s)]
*  but [[02:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=9636.24s)]
*  um [[02:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=9637.359999999999s)]
*  but i'm just trying to play by the fucking rules and [[02:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=9638.32s)]
*  Everybody's got to play by the rules and when our government is even playing by the rules anymore [[02:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=9641.92s)]
*  Then it's like well, then it makes it tough to think that someone just [[02:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=9645.52s)]
*  An everyday man is getting back. Okay, i'm gonna keep playing by them and I think that makes you guys' job even tougher [[02:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=9649.52s)]
*  It's like now you're having to almost do a government's job [[02:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=9654.88s)]
*  Well, we are police departments are the government [[02:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=9659.039999999999s)]
*  Right, but they're just that wing that it's got to take care of all that that stuff [[02:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=9661.84s)]
*  Right and you shouldn't be like the [[02:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=9666.16s)]
*  You're the most accessible part of the government too for people and that's fucking kind of scary [[02:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=9669.44s)]
*  Because you have people if they don't like the government or they think this or they think that [[02:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=9673.6s)]
*  Then you're the person that they can really reach to take it out on. You know, I don't know [[02:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=9677.36s)]
*  I'm just kind of rambling not me not not anymore. I hear you're free, baby free, man [[02:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=9681.84s)]
*  What were so many news topics we wanted to hit before we get this man out of here? [[02:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=9686.880000000001s)]
*  Um, not specifically news, but I did want to hear about when you were on the show cops [[02:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=9690.800000000001s)]
*  Oh, yeah, good call. Oh, yeah. Okay. So so cops super interesting. Um, they used to watch that as a family god [[02:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=9695.039999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I used to watch it too crazy [[02:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=9701.119999999999s)]
*  I met rosanne bar last night. How was that? [[02:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=9703.119999999999s)]

*  I just I don't know. I thought about it and I was so excited and I meant to tell you a little while [[02:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=9712.56s)]
*  I go to give her see her show growing up. Oh, absolutely. Oh [[02:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=9716.8s)]
*  Dude, i'm on stage at the comedy store, right and I hear this laugh in the back [[02:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=9719.92s)]
*  And only one of the time it happened to me was damon wayans. I heard his laugh and I grew up watching his laugh [[02:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=9724.48s)]
*  And I heard her laugh [[02:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=9729.84s)]
*  And I and it fucking just flipped in my head. I didn't know that she was back there [[02:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=9731.6s)]
*  And I was like, oh my god that rosanne bar [[02:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=9735.92s)]
*  Is in the room tonight in the crowd, you know [[02:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=9739.44s)]
*  There's probably 200 people in there or something sold out and she was nice [[02:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=9742.720000000001s)]
*  She was howling laughing [[02:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=9746.720000000001s)]
*  So then i'm like I got i'm gonna do the best I could like for all the years that she made me laugh or made [[02:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=9748.72s)]
*  Me feel or made me feel like I [[02:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=9754.96s)]
*  You know mattered in the fucking universe with that poor family that they that they worked on [[02:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=9758.0s)]
*  um [[02:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=9763.92s)]
*  I wanted to just do have that one moment to like give as much back of that as I could [[02:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=9765.279999999999s)]
*  And I crushed right on and then I got to meet her after and anyway, I was just so freaking excited [[02:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=9769.519999999999s)]
*  Um, and some girl came up and was like, oh I want you to tell and I even said to that girl you are a menace right now [[02:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=9775.679999999998s)]
*  Okay, I've worked too hard to get to meet rosanne, right? [[02:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=9782.96s)]
*  And you are fucking ruining it [[02:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=9786.88s)]
*  And she still goes [[02:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=9790.4s)]
*  She just kept telling rosanne finally was like you are ruining it [[02:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=9792.88s)]
*  Oh, that's so good. That's funny that rosanne bar did that for you. Anyway, yeah [[02:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=9797.039999999999s)]
*  I mean look there was definitely some other women did it too, but she yeah [[02:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=9800.8s)]
*  She that that had an impact and I just love her comedy and they tried to cancel her [[02:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=9804.24s)]
*  And it just fucking was like fuck them what they tried to cancel her for they canceled her for some [[02:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=9809.04s)]
*  uh [[02:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=9814.32s)]
*  She had a tweet that the twitter said was racist and she referenced like, uh, I don't even know what it was [[02:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=9815.2s)]
*  But it wasn't racist. It was just like a general term and they you know, you know how twitter was hopefully it'll get better [[02:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=9820.960000000001s)]
*  But anyway, let's yeah the cops let's hear so cops the way cops operates is is that there's there's [[02:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=9826.64s)]
*  There's a few film crews there's a sound guy and there's a camera guy [[02:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=9831.519999999999s)]
*  And I think I don't remember how many men but it was very few like four or five of these teens [[02:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=9835.279999999999s)]
*  And these guys were so interesting. Um, they essentially go out and by the time they came to our police department [[02:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=9840.16s)]
*  It had really changed because of civil law where you weren't able to just do film shit and throw it on tv [[02:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=9846.24s)]
*  You had to get waivers from everyone that was involved and that involved [[02:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=9852.8s)]
*  Criminals signing off saying yeah, you can use that shit, which is fucking so stupid [[02:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=9856.88s)]
*  If you signed off on that shit [[02:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=9860.88s)]
*  You're the dumbest guy on the face of the earth because it's all now evidence it could be used against you in court [[02:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=9862.0s)]
*  So it was really tough to get those guys to sign off. But believe it or not, you know [[02:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=9866.48s)]
*  Unfortunately when it comes to crime, you're not dealing with a lot of scholars [[02:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=9870.539999999999s)]
*  So you would get a lot of signatures, but by then it was a little tougher [[02:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=9873.68s)]
*  So what they would do is is they would ride with you they would pick an officer and they they [[02:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=9876.56s)]
*  I was fortunate enough to be picked and they would ride with you for two months [[02:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=9881.359999999999s)]
*  Every single shift [[02:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=9885.519999999999s)]
*  Yeah, and that time I was working three 12s, which is three shifts 12 3 12 hour shifts friday saturday sunday, which was the busiest [[02:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=9887.279999999999s)]
*  That's why a graveyard so that's why they wanted to ride with me [[02:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=9894.16s)]
*  so you would go out with these guys and it and the [[02:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=9898.4s)]
*  Man, it was like it was like it was like performance anxiety. You know what I mean? It's like, oh, yeah [[02:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=9901.92s)]
*  I felt this 20s. Yeah, right [[02:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=9906.8s)]
*  Jesus, I just felt this need to perform man, you know and and and it's horror. It's harrowing [[02:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=9909.279999999999s)]
*  police work is [[02:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=9914.8s)]
*  Some days there's just nothing going on [[02:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=9916.88s)]
*  You know, you gotta you gotta self-generate whether it be tickets and hope you can come up with stuff [[02:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=9918.72s)]
*  So I always felt this pressure to go out but speaking with these guys and their experiences like the the sound guy had been shot [[02:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=9922.96s)]
*  Yeah in the leg. Um, uh the other guy something had happened their stories were awesome because they had been [[02:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=9930.0s)]
*  All over they were telling me stories dude. I'm just going like fuck. That is so awesome, dude [[02:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=9936.08s)]
*  I can't believe you experienced all this shit that you've experienced [[02:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=9940.48s)]
*  I mean these guys probably walked away from that show and have mental problems themselves [[02:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=9944.8s)]
*  Yeah, because they they they essentially [[02:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=9949.6s)]
*  Were cops all the time on patrol. Well, imagine you're a sound guy and you're like, oh it sounds like somebody got shot [[02:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=9952.8s)]
*  And then it's fucking you [[02:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=9959.119999999999s)]
*  Whatever, you know, I mean they had all kind these guys had great stories [[02:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=9961.52s)]
*  So essentially they would ride with you the whole time and the issue became is you felt so much pressure to get material [[02:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=9964.4s)]
*  Oh, yeah, um that when they rode with me they rode with two different officers me and another guy [[02:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=9969.92s)]
*  And I literally didn't make the show [[02:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=9975.68s)]
*  I literally didn't make the show [[02:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=9978.48s)]
*  I didn't why and the one time I did the guy wouldn't sign off and they couldn't make the cuts to make it relevant [[02:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=9979.92s)]
*  So I they I literally didn't make but I actually became really good friends with these guys because we'd spent so much time talking [[02:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=9984.880000000001s)]
*  That I I was talking to I I don't now but I was talking to him for quite a bit calling where you at? [[02:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=9990.72s)]
*  And what's going on? And wow [[02:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=9995.28s)]
*  But the way that they do cops is [[02:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=9997.36s)]
*  When when you watch it, it looks like it's it's it's progressive. It looks like this is happening [[02:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=10000.480000000001s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[02:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=10005.92s)]
*  And it never registers with you and like they go they're in the car and they get the radio call and it's like, uh, you know [[02:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=10006.720000000001s)]
*  372 respond to non-breather [[02:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=10013.04s)]
*  Yeah, whatever it is and you see the cop go [[02:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=10015.76s)]
*  Okay [[02:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=10017.76s)]
*  And then all of a sudden he's driving and then it cuts away and you see the car making a right hand turn onto a street [[02:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=10018.08s)]
*  And then it really registers with the go. Well, how the fuck did they know he was going there to be on that thing? [[02:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=10022.88s)]
*  You know, I mean, i'm a guy that has no idea of the industry and editing all that [[02:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=10027.039999999999s)]
*  So it wasn't until they rode with me and I watched the cops and I went well how the fuck [[02:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=10031.439999999999s)]
*  Are they getting all these angles and shit? [[02:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=10036.72s)]
*  So what ends up happening is find out is they would we would have the situation [[02:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=10039.199999999999s)]
*  They would get out and they would they would be in it [[02:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=10043.519999999999s)]
*  I mean you would have to literally tell these guys look at dude [[02:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=10046.08s)]
*  You need to step the fuck back, you know, you need to get behind that car right now [[02:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=10048.0s)]
*  I get it but I I need you to do that [[02:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=10051.68s)]
*  So they were always up on you and they'd be filming and get everything they can and then they would go back go [[02:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=10054.0s)]
*  Hey, look at I think this is something we can use [[02:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=10058.4s)]
*  So this is what I need you to do [[02:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=10060.48s)]
*  I need you to drop my camera guy off on that corner and I want you to go back to this [[02:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=10061.52s)]
*  Street and then I want you to fake like you're responding to the radio. I'm going to be in it filming you [[02:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=10066.24s)]
*  You know with the other camera [[02:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=10071.28s)]
*  So there's acting involved, you know, I mean and I was a young kid and I just couldn't do it dude [[02:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=10073.04s)]
*  I'm just not an actor. You know, I mean so they would like be filming [[02:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=10077.44s)]
*  So all those guys you see doing it that's all acting up until the actual scenario. Wow [[02:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=10079.84s)]
*  What you never really? [[02:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=10086.32s)]
*  Never really crossed my mind. No. Yeah in my mind. I'm just saying oh that makes sense [[02:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=10087.68s)]
*  They have footage everywhere and they're just getting all the you know, that's like they're just dialed in and getting everything. That's [[02:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=10091.2s)]
*  They would you don't even think about now they would have tell me [[02:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=10097.28s)]
*  Okay now I want you to come and open that door [[02:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=10099.36s)]
*  You know what I mean? And then you go back and watch an episode and go okay now this shit makes sense [[02:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=10101.04s)]
*  Why didn't that ever register with me? This is all bullshit. You know, I mean except for the actual [[02:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=10104.24s)]
*  Scenarios themselves. Yeah, you know, they would just film it raw and they would [[02:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=10109.42s)]
*  Do their editing magic and and make an episode but it takes it takes two months [[02:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=10113.599999999999s)]
*  Every single night with two different teams for a half hour episode and they said they struggle sometimes to get that [[02:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=10118.48s)]
*  Yeah [[02:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=10124.88s)]
*  I've struggled to get it brother, right? [[02:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=10126.8s)]
*  Yeah [[02:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=10130.8s)]
*  Um [[02:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=10132.8s)]
*  It's weird that we're watching crime it's it weird that we watch crime that we devour it like that [[02:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=10135.599999999999s)]
*  What does it do to our psyche when we just see crime when we see? [[02:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=10141.519999999999s)]
*  murder disappearing, you know [[02:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=10146.0s)]
*  What does it do to us over time? I i've [[02:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=10148.72s)]
*  That's I I couldn't even answer that question [[02:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=10152.16s)]
*  I always think how I always think oh [[02:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=10153.599999999999s)]
*  I wonder how did I think about this kind of shit before I was exposed to all this shit because I don't think the same [[02:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=10155.199999999999s)]
*  Way you do [[02:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=10160.16s)]
*  You know what I mean? You don't think the same way I do [[02:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=10161.44s)]
*  Because I have a different perspective of it'd be like me having an opinion and the way I think about what I just explained [[02:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=10163.76s)]
*  Movies videos editing, you know, I don't I don't understand how it works. I don't know what's going on [[02:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=10170.16s)]
*  I don't know what it all pertains [[02:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=10174.48s)]
*  Same deal with police work. I don't remember how I thought before which is how you would think about it in its entirety [[02:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=10176.8s)]
*  You know cops what they do what's going on all that kind of shit because I did it for 20 years. So [[02:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=10183.36s)]
*  I watch people and they watch these shows and most of shows I go fuck. This is so stupid [[02:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=10189.679999999998s)]
*  I can't even watch this dude because [[02:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=10193.439999999999s)]
*  The world thinks this is what it is and this is so far from what it is [[02:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=10195.439999999999s)]
*  this is just entertainment, but [[02:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=10199.92s)]
*  I I [[02:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=10202.32s)]
*  I don't know what the fascination with it because I see it and I just go [[02:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=10203.679999999998s)]
*  I'll watch it and in my mind [[02:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=10207.759999999998s)]
*  There'll be a scene where I've seen caught movies where like these guys with ak-47s in the street to shoot [[02:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=10210.16s)]
*  Which is totally unrealistic but anything like a shooting or anything and for me it just makes me feel bad [[02:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=10214.24s)]
*  You know, I mean for me it just nine times out of ten [[02:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=10219.359999999999s)]
*  It'll make me think of something that's inside my brain that I don't even remember and know that it's there anymore [[02:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=10221.839999999998s)]
*  That all of a sudden like the example we said earlier. I'll see a kid in a red jacket and all of a sudden i'll [[02:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=10228.32s)]
*  I'll literally watch that kid and it just did again. That was the kid that ran into traffic [[02:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=10233.439999999999s)]
*  Yeah, i'll watch that kid die again. I and i'll always go like what the fuck, you know [[02:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=10237.599999999999s)]
*  Why the fuck am I thinking about that? And when is that finally going to be gone? And that's so crazy [[02:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=10241.679999999998s)]
*  And that's all shit i'm doing to myself in my mind. I'm not talking about it [[02:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=10246.8s)]
*  I don't talk to my wife about it, but that's my experience that happens to me a lot [[02:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=10249.76s)]
*  You know, I mean it happens to me a lot little triggers what they call them, you know, and i'll [[02:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=10253.84s)]
*  And i'll think and I won't it's never a good time to go. You know what? I just thought of honey [[02:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=10257.679999999998s)]
*  I just thought of the first time I watched this fucking guy that because I saw a kid [[02:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=10262.0s)]
*  You just kind of keep it to yourself because it's just the way that it is [[02:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=10264.8s)]
*  So when the rest of the world watches that shit [[02:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=10268.64s)]
*  I don't know dude. I don't know what the fascination is [[02:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=10272.4s)]
*  The same idea I guess is why did you want me to come in here and talk today? [[02:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=10276.72s)]
*  Because I guess you people want to know they want to know they want to know they want to see they want to understand [[02:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=10280.48s)]
*  the problem with tv is [[02:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=10286.24s)]
*  That's that's a that's a leak. That's a very watered down version of reality [[02:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=10289.199999999999s)]
*  Right and it's also a version that they have mastered the like how to have the algorithm of and make it [[02:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=10294.16s)]
*  Entertainment cheap to shoot as efficient as possible [[02:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=10299.679999999998s)]
*  Blah blah blah blah blah and a lot of the people the worst part is [[02:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=10302.88s)]
*  I think a lot of cop maybe you know 50 years ago cop shows or detective shows how much [[02:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=10306.56s)]
*  Somebody who involved in the production may have had a family member that was an officer now [[02:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=10312.32s)]
*  It's like [[02:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=10316.24s)]
*  I feel like some of these people making stuff are so far removed from any of the reality of it [[02:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=10317.359999999999s)]
*  That uh, they don't even have a human sense of it [[02:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=10322.4s)]
*  And so, you know, absolutely and if you watch as a cop if you watch a show and you'll see it and you go [[02:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=10324.96s)]
*  Do someone in law enforcement had something to do with this? You can tell you can tell you can tell someone [[02:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=10329.52s)]
*  Someone that knows a cop or is a cop or has been a pastor [[02:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=10333.84s)]
*  They got a consultant or someone someone told them that because no one else would know that [[02:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=10336.48s)]
*  What about this man? Let's say it's a quiet night out there. You ever [[02:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=10341.76s)]
*  Way to bust off and get you a 20 minute nap in somewhere. Oh, hell. Yeah. Fuck. Yeah. Yeah. Hell yeah [[02:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=10345.04s)]

*  I mean you just have to you know, you just gotta do it in a responsible way and [[02:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=10380.24s)]
*  We would have a couple times we would go behind this church and it was a parking lot that was really secluded with the walls [[02:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=10383.84s)]
*  Perfect, you know [[02:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=10389.28s)]

*  sprawled across bring blankets to lay over the middle and [[02:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=10398.0s)]
*  But we actually would get woken up once while by the priest [[02:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=10401.28s)]
*  He would come in the morning and see us all there and knock on our window and it became a thing [[02:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=10404.32s)]
*  You know, we're all thank you so much and he was cool about he never told on us and [[02:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=10407.68s)]

*  Oh did they have you know a lot of people sending people sending videos a lot of like drug induced homosexuality like men that [[02:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=10422.800000000001s)]
*  Will do drugs and then start making out you guys see a lot of that out there [[02:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=10430.240000000002s)]
*  In weir we had a pretty prominent gay community [[02:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=10435.52s)]
*  Um [[02:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=10438.82s)]
*  and [[02:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=10440.1s)]
*  But anybody being gay is just kind of like that's normal. That's like a regular [[02:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=10440.98s)]
*  Some people are gay some people are straight some people in the middle [[02:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=10445.06s)]
*  I'm talking about men that get geeked up on pills or powder uppers poppers and all that kind of stuff [[02:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=10447.86s)]
*  Methamphetamine is really big in the gay community. So will meth lead people to being gay you think [[02:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=10453.46s)]
*  Uh, no, you could give me about a pound of meth and I don't think i'd ever be gay [[02:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=10458.82s)]
*  I don't think it ever leads up to being gay, but it definitely [[02:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=10462.74s)]
*  It definitely uh, I think it enhanced the situations, you know, we had a part yeah, right it made that's all it takes [[02:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=10465.619999999999s)]
*  There was a little enhancement get that video. Is that do we have it? [[02:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=10472.26s)]
*  I'm looking i'm looking for it. Okay, cool. Thanks [[02:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=10475.539999999999s)]
*  Yeah [[02:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=10477.539999999999s)]
*  we had a park where they would where the gay community would get together and kind of meet each other and and [[02:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=10477.699999999999s)]
*  And it was in the bathroom. There was this whole process that they [[02:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=10482.5s)]
*  They would they would participate in to meet one another and it was you'd stand at the urinal in the public bathroom [[02:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=10486.02s)]
*  And if you were standing there long enough and did the right looks and that the other guys would know and it was hey [[02:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=10492.34s)]
*  How are you and sometimes a little further so we would have guys work? [[02:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=10496.820000000002s)]
*  Um at that time just because the people didn't like it in the park and it became real prevalent in one park [[02:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=10500.820000000002s)]
*  I mean and and sometimes the sexual activity was [[02:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=10505.54s)]
*  A little rampant [[02:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=10510.26s)]
*  A little much being performed in a public park so they wanted to go away [[02:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=10511.380000000001s)]
*  So we had the guys undercover that would go in and stand there and think we actually had an officer that was standing there and he [[02:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=10514.980000000001s)]
*  made himself [[02:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=10520.18s)]
*  Known as a police officer because it became apparent and the guy grabbed his his junk [[02:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=10521.62s)]
*  And got a death grip on it because he was scared [[02:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=10527.54s)]
*  You know and and yeah the situation was hilarious because he wouldn't let go and we all had to come in and we're screaming at [[02:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=10529.460000000001s)]
*  This guy let him go let him go and the guys just hold him on his wiener cops [[02:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=10534.820000000002s)]
*  Yeah [[02:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=10538.02s)]
*  He's the guy standing there with a death grip on his thing and you know [[02:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=10538.34s)]
*  He doesn't want to get in a fight or nothing because there ain't a lot holding that on you know, so [[02:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=10540.42s)]
*  Right. Yeah, all it takes is one real meth head to rip hard. I imagine. Yeah, that's something I don't want to discover [[02:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=10545.62s)]
*  Did um, but do um [[02:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=10550.58s)]
*  Did uh, did you some guys have to get stationed in the bathroom sometimes? [[02:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=10553.62s)]
*  That's what we would do [[02:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=10558.5s)]
*  We would go in the bathroom and put ourselves in the situation to because it was a whole process and drugs were very prevalent [[02:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=10559.220000000001s)]
*  You know, hey, can I give you some of this and that? [[02:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=10565.94s)]
*  Okay, let's see what this is what's happening. We're seeing people sending in this type of stuff here [[02:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=10568.02s)]
*  and these two gentlemen, you can [[02:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=10572.42s)]
*  And how they're just buddies, you know, but I think of the drugs at a certain point gets you pretty close there, you know [[02:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=10580.58s)]
*  Like are we? [[02:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=10586.42s)]
*  Yeah [[02:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=10588.18s)]
*  It's like oh, that's almost like a good buy doesn't really see that to me doesn't seem like really like [[02:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=10589.380000000001s)]
*  Homoerotic behavior that just seemed like two fellas like i'm fucked up. Are you? [[02:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=10594.48s)]
*  I think it looks like the one guy is maybe not totally into it and maybe he's just trying to get a free slurpee or something [[02:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=10598.5s)]
*  Like there's something in it for him [[02:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=10604.02s)]
*  But this is a lot of what's been going on these days and people have been sending in a lot of videos like this [[02:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=10606.26s)]
*  Yeah, we actually um, I when I was in homicide. I actually went to a training course where they taught about um [[02:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=10611.060000000001s)]
*  In the community in the gay community apparently based on the training I received [[02:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=10618.66s)]
*  There's something called it was called they called it homosexual overkill [[02:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=10623.86s)]
*  And when there's murders involved in the gay community, it's usually really really brutal really passionate [[02:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=10627.7s)]
*  Really over the top, you know like chopping each other chopping up and [[02:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=10633.94s)]
*  And I think the training was just to make you aware when you came to a murder if you saw something that was [[02:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=10639.060000000001s)]
*  Completely over the top as far as the way it went down that it was there could be that [[02:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=10644.720000000001s)]
*  It could be an avenue to start looking at you know [[02:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=10650.980000000001s)]
*  Maybe this is a maybe a gay community thing that we can get some information from or like jeffrey dammer really essentially [[02:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=10653.460000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I mean I remember going to the training and it was it was very graphic [[02:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=10659.460000000001s)]
*  Wow, whether that's true in its entirety or not. I don't know [[02:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=10662.98s)]
*  Well gay guys, I think do everything to extreme kind of I don't think i'd be shocked if they're like, you know [[02:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=10666.34s)]
*  Julian a guy up or something if he's being a bad guy. Yeah [[02:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=10670.74s)]
*  Um, I think we covered a lot of stuff. What do you think there zach? [[02:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=10674.82s)]
*  Yeah, we pretty much covered everything in the run of show a lot of stories, right? [[02:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=10678.02s)]
*  We'd love well look man. I think we'd love to even have you back sometime [[02:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=10680.98s)]
*  We'll have you back when there's a crime or something or if there's something neat that we can talk about [[02:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=10683.14s)]
*  I've just i've really enjoyed learning about what uh [[02:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=10686.5s)]
*  Some of your experience has been like, you know and getting a little bit more of an emotional aspect of [[02:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=10690.259999999998s)]
*  Of what an officer goes through and could potentially go through every day [[02:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=10696.9s)]
*  That's crazy when I think about a 21 year old guy just rolling out of a parking lot [[02:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=10700.58s)]
*  In a in a vehicle and like in a different time [[02:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=10705.14s)]
*  I mean a good time when cops were looked at a little different [[02:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=10708.259999999998s)]
*  I used to post up at three o'clock in the morning at the nightclubs getting out, you know, because there was actually [[02:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=10711.14s)]
*  An appeal to being a police officer [[02:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=10716.42s)]
*  So, you know I started at a good time and I ended in the bad time for being a cop, you know [[02:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=10718.900000000001s)]
*  But do you think we can get to a better time again? [[02:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=10724.26s)]
*  Or do you think we you're curious to see how we're going to get there? [[02:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=10726.34s)]
*  Yeah, I don't know. We got to we have to it's got to get better [[02:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=10729.060000000001s)]
*  It can't it can't get any worse or we're going to be in real trouble [[02:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=10731.94s)]
*  but I really appreciate you having me in here and having the venue to [[02:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=10734.820000000002s)]

*  cornerstone [[02:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=10760.019999999999s)]
*  Oh, but when I reach that ground I'll share this piece of my life out I can feel it [[02:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=10763.38s)]
*  in my bones [[02:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=10770.9s)]
*  But it's gonna take [[02:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6AmtrTWNtM&t=10772.9s)]
