*  Today's episode is brought to you by Liquid Death. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=0.0s)]
*  Today's guest is a unique man. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=3.6s)]
*  He's had a lifestyle, an experience that not many get to have. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=6.96s)]
*  He's led a rare path. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=15.36s)]
*  He is celebrated and discussed. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=21.12s)]
*  Ad nauseum, you might say. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=23.64s)]
*  I think that means getting sick. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=26.0s)]
*  I don't know what that means exactly. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=27.0s)]
*  We're happy to have him here today. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=29.080000000000002s)]
*  He's a retired NFL quarterback and the host of Uncut with Jay Cutler. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=31.28s)]
*  It is the man himself, Mr. Jay Cutler. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=38.480000000000004s)]
*  We're grateful you're coming in. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=58.44s)]
*  I know you got a podcast starting up. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=75.92s)]
*  We have a lot of podcast listeners over the years with this podcast and a different podcast. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=77.84s)]
*  So I know you went on Nate the other day. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=81.8s)]
*  It's pretty cool. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=84.08s)]
*  Because Nate's a big fan. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=85.24s)]
*  He's a big Vanderbilt fan. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=90.75999999999999s)]
*  Huge Vanity fan. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=91.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=92.67999999999999s)]
*  From here, grew up here. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=93.08s)]
*  And he's funny as hell too. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=95.0s)]
*  He means it. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=99.24s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=99.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=100.32s)]
*  Nate Barghetti. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=101.24s)]
*  He's really that he's a real more of a scientist of humor. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=102.03999999999999s)]
*  I feel like he's like it's calculated almost. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=106.92s)]
*  He sets it up. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=110.24s)]
*  He's got his whole thing. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=111.52s)]
*  And whenever you walked in, you don't really know. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=113.24000000000001s)]
*  I just started doing this podcast stuff. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=116.96000000000001s)]
*  So you don't really know how it's going to go with somebody you don't know. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=118.52000000000001s)]
*  Doing something with somebody you know, you're like, all right, I've got this down. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=121.84s)]
*  I got this figured out. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=125.16s)]
*  But when he walked in, I was like, shit, this might not go well. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=126.84s)]
*  Because he was not a lot of emotion. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=131.52s)]
*  Just kind of just sat down. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=134.2s)]
*  And he's like, oh, boy. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=135.68s)]
*  He's real passive. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=138.04s)]
*  He's a calm guy. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=139.0s)]
*  I'm trying to feel it. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=140.0s)]
*  It almost sometimes feels with Nate like I'm getting in trouble for something [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=141.52s)]
*  in the beginning. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=145.68s)]
*  But then once you kind of get to know that he's just it's just kind of some of his demeanor. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=146.44s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=151.24s)]
*  He's real smart. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=151.92000000000002s)]
*  He's a real smart guy, man. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=153.36s)]
*  Yeah, what else going on? [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=156.72s)]
*  I had a freaking bad dream last night. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=157.8s)]
*  Do you ever have those dreams? [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=159.56s)]
*  I just get shocked sometimes, even as an adult, that I'll have these dreams [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=161.48000000000002s)]
*  where I'll wake up and I'm like, what's your heart? [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=164.84s)]
*  You know, I'll be drooling. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=167.72s)]
*  I'll be like, what? [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=168.92s)]
*  Oh, yeah, you know, talking about it. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=169.76s)]
*  I know you're talking about it. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=172.51999999999998s)]
*  I don't feel like I dream that much anymore. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=173.88s)]
*  I don't know what that says about me. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=175.79999999999998s)]
*  It might not be a good thing. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=176.92s)]
*  Yeah, or it might be a good thing. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=178.72s)]
*  You might have to get your chakras worked on or something, man. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=180.76s)]
*  I have a couple of Indian buddies and they're always like, dude, your chakras are bad. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=183.64s)]
*  And I'm like, how do you fix that? [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=186.6s)]
*  That's what I try to get into it with them. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=188.11999999999998s)]
*  And it's like, I would love to get my chakras fixed. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=190.27999999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=193.16s)]
*  Oh, dude, that would be a good show of something. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=193.67999999999998s)]
*  Jay Cutler's gets his chakras fixed. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=197.32s)]
*  That's a good show. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=199.0s)]
*  That's a great idea. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=200.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=200.84s)]

*  It may. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=203.48000000000002s)]
*  You may need a construction worker. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=203.96s)]
*  I might need like five of these guys in here. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=207.64000000000001s)]
*  One guy's not going to fix me. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=210.76s)]
*  Yeah, you may need a little bit of work, man. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=212.36s)]
*  Yeah, I'm trying to think. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=216.36s)]

*  This called Liquid Death. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=219.72s)]
*  This is a water company. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=220.68s)]
*  From the Austrian Alps? [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=222.52s)]
*  Yeah, it almost sounds a little, I don't want to say Nazi water, [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=225.56s)]
*  but it's good. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=228.44s)]
*  Definitely. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=228.84s)]
*  It sounds like on the can. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=229.23999999999998s)]
*  I don't know who's. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=230.92s)]
*  Stone Cold Mountain Water came straight from the Alps to murder your thirst. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=231.72s)]
*  You've got like cool sponsors. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=239.07999999999998s)]

*  It's pretty good. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=243.56s)]
*  You know, they mail us a lot of water, man. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=244.2s)]
*  Well, that's nice. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=246.51999999999998s)]
*  I'll send you a couple cases. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=247.07999999999998s)]
*  I know you don't need it. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=248.12s)]

*  Yeah, maybe I'll just put it on my podcast and just be like, hey, [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=252.35999999999999s)]
*  I'm just doing this. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=255.23999999999998s)]
*  Oh, I bet they'd probably get on board. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=256.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=258.36s)]
*  You know? [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=258.76s)]
*  I mean, the amount of like weird ad sponsor requests is mind boggling to me. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=260.36s)]
*  What did you have to read? [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=267.15999999999997s)]
*  I didn't see your ads yet on your first set. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=267.96s)]
*  On your first episode. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=269.71999999999997s)]
*  We did a, I should know this. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=270.03999999999996s)]
*  I really should. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=274.03999999999996s)]
*  Maybe not. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=274.76s)]
*  It's OK if you don't. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=275.24s)]
*  I did a like a helicopter, basically a helicopter ambulance. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=276.28000000000003s)]
*  Oh, really? [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=284.6s)]
*  So if you're hurt somewhere and you can't get to a hospital, this, you pay $149 a year. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=285.16s)]
*  No way. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=291.08s)]
*  And this helicopter will come and get you and take you to a hospital. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=291.56s)]
*  Dude, that sounds. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=297.16s)]
*  I didn't even know it was a thing. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=298.04s)]
*  It sounds like risk. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=299.48s)]
*  It sounds very something that would happen to like somebody in Mexico. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=300.52s)]
*  It sounds like a kidnapping or more like a Colombian type of thing. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=303.56s)]
*  I mean, I kind of I mean, I kind of want to do it. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=307.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=309.08s)]

*  It's like everybody believes so much information, but none of it's like, I believe less and less [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=603.18s)]
*  because I put out information and people will tell me like, oh man, that's real. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=608.54s)]
*  And I'm like, I don't know. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=611.98s)]
*  No idea. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=612.9399999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=613.66s)]
*  And everyone's got an agenda. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=614.54s)]
*  It depends who you got it from. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=615.9s)]
*  Like everyone's spinning something. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=617.5s)]
*  It's just hard to trust anything. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=619.1s)]
*  Yeah. That's the thing I think. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=621.5s)]
*  So then I go back to my instincts and sometimes my instincts, I feel like [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=622.4599999999999s)]
*  usually have served me pretty good, but sometimes it's hard to know. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=626.06s)]
*  When you look back at like, so now you're not a quarterback now. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=631.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=634.62s)]
*  You'll always be a quarterback, but you're not doing it like on a day-to-day basis. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=634.9399999999999s)]
*  I don't get paid anymore. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=638.78s)]
*  Right. You're not getting paid. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=639.66s)]
*  Yeah. I guess maybe that defines it. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=640.4599999999999s)]
*  Do you look at and see like, man, what a position I was in? [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=642.6199999999999s)]
*  Like, is it different to look? [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=645.9799999999999s)]
*  Like sometimes I'll look at things in my life and be like, man, I didn't kind of [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=648.06s)]
*  not realize the position I was in, but you know, like to a regular man looking at a [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=651.5s)]
*  quarterback, you're like, dang, that's the guy, you know, that's Odysseus or whatever. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=657.42s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, that's a great point. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=660.9399999999999s)]
*  And like looking back on it now, like you get tunnel vision and like you don't, you [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=662.9399999999999s)]
*  don't maybe enjoy it or have as much fun or take advantage of it as much as you would [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=666.38s)]
*  now looking back on it. I mean, you're just locked in and you're just doing your job and [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=673.82s)]
*  you know, it turns sometimes it's a grind. Sometimes it's fun. Sometimes it's really hard. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=677.34s)]
*  But looking back on it now, you know, I don't say, I don't want to say that I wish I would [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=682.06s)]
*  have done things differently, but it wasn't, it wasn't awesome, awesome experience. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=688.22s)]
*  It was an awesome experience. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=694.22s)]
*  It was an awesome experience. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=695.02s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=695.9s)]
*  Yes. And it shaped a lot of like who I am and you know, the people I associate with [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=696.86s)]
*  and how I respond to things. And so, I mean, it's, it's, you know, from the time I was [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=701.5s)]
*  fourth grade till, you know, 35, it kind of shaped me. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=707.74s)]
*  Yeah, I just can't, I was trying to think about something in my life that had been that [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=711.58s)]
*  much of like a shit, like a thing that I was like a vehicle in my life. And I don't know if I've [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=715.02s)]
*  had that. So it just must seem a lot that you now you're in like a new career. It's like you're [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=721.34s)]
*  trying to find, are you, do you want to find a new career? Do you feel like you need to, [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=725.5s)]
*  or are you just kind of like, I don't know. Like, what do you think? Like, do you feel [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=729.5s)]
*  like a pressure to, or do you just? [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=737.34s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, because I mean, like not many people when they're 35 or whatever age people [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=739.02s)]
*  that are playing football, like have to go out there and in the real world and like figure it, [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=744.54s)]
*  figure out the rest of your life. Right. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=748.46s)]
*  So a career, career, I don't know if that's the right word. I think like for me, it's more like [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=749.98s)]
*  purpose, like what, what is going to drive me? What gives me purpose in my life going forward? [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=755.9s)]
*  And there was pressure when I, when I got out to like, to figure that out. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=761.8199999999999s)]
*  And I was never one of those guys that had other businesses or stuff going on when I played. It [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=766.6999999999999s)]
*  was literally, I was just, I played football, like I had plan a, and there was no backup. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=771.02s)]
*  And so now when I got out, it was just like, all right, I'm, I'm clueless what I'm going to do. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=775.66s)]
*  I have no idea. I know that football is over. I knew I didn't want to coach. I knew I wanted [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=781.82s)]
*  to kind of get out of that world. So it was really just trying to figure out, all right, [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=787.02s)]
*  what the hell am I going to wake up and be happy doing? Gives me a sense of purpose. I like it. I [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=791.74s)]
*  like the people I'm working with. And that took time, you know, and I'm probably still kind of [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=798.7s)]
*  figuring that one out. So when you start the cause I was, yeah, I was watching your first episode. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=804.38s)]
*  It's called, uh, uncut with J color. Yeah. Uncut with J. Cutler or something like that. Yeah. And [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=810.54s)]
*  you're J. Color, dude. Yeah. Yeah. They'll figure it out. Google. Um, yeah. I was like, cause it's, [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=815.18s)]
*  cause it's injury. Cause you're definitely kind of like this, you kind of remind me of a cross [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=823.98s)]
*  between like Christian Leighton and like Sasquatch a little, like you're kind of like that. Yeah. And [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=828.06s)]
*  it's, I don't mean in a negative way. I love that. Okay. Cool. Yeah. It's like, um, yeah, you're kind [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=833.18s)]
*  of like this interesting figure that the media gave a lot of attention to, like weird attention [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=839.18s)]
*  kind of and shit, but that's kind of the best, you know, in a way nowadays, that's almost like the best [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=843.8199999999999s)]
*  kind of attention you can get out there in a weird way. It's like, it's not super real. Nobody really [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=849.26s)]
*  knows what's going on. Yeah. There's a vagueness there too. And, you know, and it wasn't intentional. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=854.62s)]
*  You know, I think there's just certain aspects of my life that I like keeping private [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=860.62s)]
*  that, you know, I don't really talk about. Um, and I'm probably going to try to keep it that way. Yeah. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=864.38s)]
*  And I think that, you know, I did a reality show for a little bit after I was done and, [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=871.8199999999999s)]
*  you know, I think as soon as you start like pulling back and like kind of shielding yourself some, [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=878.14s)]
*  like people really want to get into that and figure that out and know more. Um, so I think that kind of [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=883.02s)]
*  played into it, but you know, the podcast, I don't know where that's going to go. Yeah. But it's kind [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=888.38s)]
*  of cool. I, that's what I noticed in your opening. It was like, kind of like, you weren't trying to be [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=893.42s)]
*  too much. I didn't feel like, or trying to be a certain thing. You're kind of like, [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=898.78s)]
*  I don't know where this is going to go. No idea. You know? Um, and that was a hard part about doing [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=902.46s)]
*  it. Um, of, of doing the opening, the interviews and stuff is that's easy. Like, but like for me, [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=907.98s)]
*  I was like, I don't, I don't know what to say in this opening thing. And I don't really want to [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=915.34s)]
*  say too much about me. I really don't want to divulge like a lot going forward right now. So like this, [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=920.86s)]
*  I'm just going to tell you, you know, I don't know what the hell I'm doing. We're going to have some [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=927.58s)]
*  fun. Maybe it works. Maybe it doesn't work, but let's just do this and go. It's funny, man, because it [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=930.62s)]
*  kind of reminded me too, when I started podcasting, I just started in my kitchen. I didn't really know. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=935.82s)]
*  When did you start? I started maybe about five years ago, maybe, or four years ago. I'd gone [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=939.74s)]
*  on Joe Rogan's podcast a couple of times. Maybe I, or maybe a marathon. That's not a podcast. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=945.1800000000001s)]
*  Oh dude. It was so hard. What do you guys, how does he have like, does he have like a, [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=950.62s)]
*  like a notebook of stuff? He just, he just goes, he's a notebook man. Yeah, he is a notebook. He's [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=956.22s)]
*  incredible. Oh dude. He's like a Swiss army notebook. Yeah. He, um, but I mean, is there an option [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=961.26s)]
*  like to be like after like an hour of like tapping out or like you're just stuck? I think you want to, [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=967.9s)]
*  but I think part of the mystique about Joe Rogan's is that you go in there and you're like, [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=972.46s)]
*  you know, I want to be able to go toe to toe. You know what I'm saying? He's kind of like this, [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=978.7s)]
*  um, this symbol of, of not necessarily just machismo, but somewhat of machismo for sure. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=982.46s)]
*  So you want to be able to be like, okay, I can do by time. You know, it's like I hung in there with [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=988.62s)]
*  him. Yes. Yeah. And it's, you're just like, dude, and you hit about two hours and you have a cramp [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=993.02s)]
*  that you're trying to deny and you're still trying to like remember. Yeah, totally. He'll do a [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=997.58s)]
*  bathroom break sometimes. Um, I remember at one point I remember saying, Hey man, this is the [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=1002.14s)]
*  longest conversation I've ever been in my entire life. Sure. And it was, and it was like almost [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=1007.58s)]
*  scary to think that, you know, that I'm talking to a man that, uh, that, uh, that I've gotten to know [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=1013.02s)]
*  better, but I didn't know super great at the time. That was scary, man. I feel like it's a, it's [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=1017.5s)]
*  going in there. It's kind of scary cause then they close the door and the sound kind of gets [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=1023.26s)]
*  it. It's just you guys. And you almost think he can hear like, like the thoughts in your head. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=1026.46s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. He's just like peering through your brain. Like he's got that third ear. Yeah, bro. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=1034.06s)]
*  Some people got that third eye. Some of them feel like Joe has that third ear, man. Um, [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=1038.94s)]
*  but, but that really helped like kind of get, get it going. I think [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=1043.9s)]
*  doing other podcasts, I think podcasts gave a lot of like, I, I, I worked in, in, in Los [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=1048.46s)]
*  Angeles and Hollywood for a long time and I never really found some footing in television and stuff. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=1054.46s)]
*  I felt like, especially as they started to like really move away from like, you know, regular guys, [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=1058.46s)]
*  I'm not even like a real redneck guy, but I think they immediately, you're from the south. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=1064.22s)]
*  I'm from Louisiana. Yeah. So, but I think they, they, they're just weren't a lot of opportunities. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=1067.82s)]
*  And I think that's what podcasting has done. It's kind of just given opportunities for regular guys, [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=1072.78s)]
*  not to have to use like these vehicles of Hollywood. Yeah. The agents and the, [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=1077.1000000000001s)]
*  and all, all the things. Yeah. Yeah. And there's, and there's, there's so many talented people out [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=1081.26s)]
*  there now. Yeah. And there's so many vehicles, like you're saying now of people getting their [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=1085.26s)]
*  talent out there and letting people know and doing all those things, which I mean, it's a good thing. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=1089.66s)]
*  Yeah. It's interesting. I mean, it kind of puts the power a lot of in your own hands. Absolutely. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=1094.3799999999999s)]
*  And, and even I thought about like, I have friends that like get canceled or whatever. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=1098.3799999999999s)]
*  It only helps that these days. It's almost like if you, you want to get canceled, if you schedule, [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=1102.62s)]
*  you're canceling well, dude, you're fricking, you're going to go to the top. You're Morgan [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=1108.06s)]

*  himself. Does that get you canceled? I feel like that. It got his account canceled, but it helped [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=1156.54s)]
*  him. But it helped. Yeah. Definitely like, yeah. Nude is, I mean, that's obviously one way to go. [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=1161.02s)]
*  I don't know if that's for me. I wouldn't do it kind of my hips kind of run right into my stomach [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=1165.42s)]
*  and it's good. Yeah. It's just not maybe work. Maybe, maybe like work out for a month and just [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=1169.98s)]
*  like get jacked up and then do it. That's the, that of like a, like a, I kind of have the butt [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=1175.98s)]

*  from the side, it's not good. You've, you've thought about this a few times. I mean, this is the most [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=1188.7s)]
*  I've thought about it with another man in the room, you know? But, um, I don't know. It's a good [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=1193.1799999999998s)]
*  question. Even though sports illustrated issues where everybody's like semi naked in there and [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=1198.6999999999998s)]

*  You're right. If you say art, like you're good. I'm, I'm expressing my, my, my body in, in an [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=1214.54s)]
*  artistic way. That's true. Actually. I put a pride flag in the back and to say, Hey homie, [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=1221.34s)]
*  this is art, dude. You know, I feel like you put a, if you add in like an, that like an extra [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=1224.94s)]
*  element of like, like a group that's kind of, um, an outlet, not like an outlier group, but a group [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=1230.7s)]
*  that like, you know, struggles to find their footing a lot of times. I feel like that kind [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=1235.9s)]
*  of can give you like a carte blanche sometimes. Yeah, sometimes. But if you talk about it before [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=1240.14s)]
*  in this way and then do it, you're probably, it probably won't work. Yeah, that's true. So I, [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=1246.6999999999998s)]
*  I think you're kind of screwed now. What would you go? You think if you had to do a new, would [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=1251.4199999999998s)]
*  you go side? Would you go cause side your wiener is going to peek out the front a little. Yeah. [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=1255.26s)]
*  Hopefully. Yeah. Hopefully. Yeah. I mean, or yeah. I mean, you want to put that, [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=1260.3s)]
*  that body part in its best light. I think if you're going to do it. Yeah. So I don't know. [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=1266.78s)]
*  That's a tough question. And if I did front, maybe I would do something else to like take away, [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=1273.34s)]
*  take away from that. Maybe like a cool hat or something. I don't know what I would do. [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=1277.98s)]
*  Just like, Hey, look at this. Don't look at that. Just peek at that. But look at this. [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=1286.22s)]
*  Yeah. Maybe something like that. Um, when you did, do you notice what the reality TV reality TV is [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=1291.58s)]
*  very scary to me. It's an interesting thing. I feel like it, that, that is a world that really [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=1297.6599999999999s)]
*  digs and tries to like, it gets really manipulative. Um, do you, uh, do you think that [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=1302.22s)]
*  reality TV, like, do you think that being a celebrity and being married in like in a celebrity [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=1309.82s)]
*  kind of relationship, is that a lot more pressure on a marriage than you think a regular marriage? [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=1316.7s)]
*  Or do you think it's just kind of grandfathered in after time and you get the hang of it? Um, [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=1320.8600000000001s)]
*  I think, I think it can go either way. I think it definitely puts pressure, um, [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=1326.62s)]
*  on the relationship because you, you want it to be portrayed a certain way on film and that, [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=1331.6599999999999s)]
*  and that might not be reality. And I think that's where it gets a little, little, little, little [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=1337.7399999999998s)]
*  fuzzy. Cause you know, you're, you're doing this on television and then like, you know, it, [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=1344.9399999999998s)]
*  it's rainbows and sunshine and like, that's not really real life for the most part. Like, you know, [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=1350.86s)]
*  there's highs and stuff, but like real life can be married real life. Like it, there's a lot of [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=1355.66s)]
*  boring times. It just is what it is. Like you can't always be, you know, riding the sky high. Yeah. [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=1360.94s)]
*  Um, after, after a certain point, it's like, all right, you know, you're married and it's just, [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=1367.42s)]
*  you know, we're just, we're living together. You're just sitting around. You're just waiting for, [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=1371.98s)]
*  you're sitting in the car, waiting for your wife to get in the car. Yeah. I mean, you go to dinner, [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=1374.78s)]
*  like you can do fun stuff, but like there's other times where it's like, yeah, we're just, [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=1378.5400000000002s)]
*  we're just living life. Like it's just, it's another, it's another Wednesday. Yeah. Yeah. [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=1383.1000000000001s)]
*  Sebastian Maniscalco does on his Instagram. He does a lot of waiting for his wife. Yeah. I love [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=1387.66s)]
*  his Instagram. Yeah. His is almost like that. That to me a lot of times feels like a real reality. [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=1392.78s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely. It's him like stumbling through the packages at the door and like being like, [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=1397.26s)]
*  which one of these? And that's like real everyday life. Yeah. Um, so yeah, I mean, reality TV, [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=1401.58s)]
*  it's, it's painting a picture that isn't always necessarily true. Um, and I think it kind of skews [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=1406.78s)]
*  the audience a little bit, but I mean, that's what reality TV is there for, you know, it's for, [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=1413.98s)]
*  for drama or for whatever, you know, all, all, all those things. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I think about why [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=1417.42s)]
*  some of it I look at, I think I want to just, sometimes I remember, especially when I was like [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=1423.5s)]
*  kind of growing up, I guess, or maybe like I've made a little bit of money, but I'm not, I'm not [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=1430.3799999999999s)]
*  like a real rich guy, but I remember I wanted to see some of the Kardashians because I wanted to [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=1435.5s)]
*  see what it was like if somebody was rich, you know, sure. Like if they had like, you know, [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=1440.06s)]
*  indoor pets, like that kind of shit, you know what I'm saying? You want to see what people are doing, [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=1446.14s)]
*  you know, I remember that. But, um, do you feel like it can, do you feel like that had any effect [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=1451.18s)]
*  on like your, you got your relationship and I'm not trying to get any relationship, but do you [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=1457.1s)]
*  feel like that, like that can rat, like, I just don't, I'm really untrustworthy of that kind of [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=1460.94s)]
*  stuff. So even the side effects of a lot of that momentum and what's glamour and stuff like that, [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=1467.98s)]
*  we can start to believe it. Oh, absolutely. Yeah. I mean, and you start to, you start to believe it [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=1473.98s)]
*  and you start to think, um, that's how it should always be. And, you know, and you know, it's the [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=1478.06s)]
*  grass is greener on the side. Like all those things can, someone can fall into that trap. Um, [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=1484.7s)]
*  I didn't fall into it. Um, but it definitely could happen. And it's, you know, and it, [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=1490.06s)]
*  I, reality TV doesn't bother me and I would, I'd go back and do it again for sure. [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=1497.74s)]
*  And if someone came to me with an awesome reality TV show idea, I'd, I'd do it. I mean, [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=1503.34s)]
*  I've got no issues with it. It's just, I think you have to be really grounded in kind of who you are [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=1507.58s)]
*  and what you want out of it. Right. And, and, and realize that, Hey, this is, this is a job period. [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=1512.78s)]
*  And your life has to be in a stable place and you have to realize, all right, when the cameras are [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=1519.66s)]
*  gone, like it's just normal life again. Yeah. Which I'm sure it's hard for some people. [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=1525.02s)]
*  Yeah. I would bet probably. I mean, I bet it's almost like in some similar, it's the same of [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=1531.58s)]
*  like being, you know, doing football or doing something for a long time and then being out of [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=1535.5s)]
*  this, like, but it's almost even different because you're not, you don't get to like, [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=1539.42s)]
*  not hide behind a game, but you're playing within a vehicle football. It's not like it's you [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=1544.8600000000001s)]
*  standing out there like, and you just yell out some secrets at the line. And then, you know, [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=1550.94s)]
*  the offensive lineman turns around and tells you a secret, you know, it's like, but I mean, [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=1555.18s)]
*  people get, people get confused by this stuff because it becomes their sense of self, like [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=1558.54s)]
*  that's who they are. Right. And that's what you do for a living. That's, that's not what, [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=1562.46s)]
*  that's not you. That you, you, if you're, if your validation is through that stuff, [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=1568.3s)]
*  that's eventually going to go away. Like you're going to be lost. And you know, some people, [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=1574.86s)]
*  it takes them a little bit to figure that out and find out like, all right, how do I get validated? [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=1578.86s)]
*  You know, what, who am I? Like what makes me tick? And it's, it's a, and I think that's pretty [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=1583.26s)]
*  common for a lot of people, I'm sure within their jobs and within kind of who they are. [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=1590.38s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. I could probably think that too, man. Yeah. I mean, if your podcast is, [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=1594.3s)]
*  everything's gone tomorrow and you got to go down to wherever and work, like it's going to be, [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=1599.6599999999999s)]
*  it's going to be a different experience. Like you're going to be like, oh, wait, like it's all gone. [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=1605.6599999999999s)]
*  Like that was kind of liquid death. I was talking on camera. It was like, where are the lights at? [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=1609.8999999999999s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. That's a good point. I, yeah. Sometimes I think about that. What would I do? [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=1615.1s)]
*  Sometimes. What would you do? You know, like they in podcast tomorrow. No one can do podcasts. [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=1618.94s)]
*  They outlawed them. They outlawed them. Yeah. They put a mask on all the cameras, [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=1625.42s)]
*  which they easily could, you know, [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=1630.62s)]
*  to mass just for just in case. Um, that's a great question, man. I mean, I do stand up comedy for [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=1633.8999999999999s)]
*  a living. So I'd have that. But if I, if that went, if that went to, yeah, man, I don't know. [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=1641.34s)]
*  I'd probably hopefully try to get myself a little bit of land and maybe do just become a prepper, [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=1646.46s)]
*  maybe a prepper, but also a prepper who has like a side paintball type of biz, maybe, [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=1652.06s)]
*  and also maybe a pumpkin patch kind of like, okay, for holidays. Yeah. Yeah. Something where it's [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=1655.66s)]
*  like, at least you're on the holidays. People are going to come around to see people, see people. [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=1660.54s)]

*  And I don't know if you're even able to see what this would be like. What is it about a guy like [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=1847.6599999999999s)]
*  Tom Brady that makes him so capable to pull it off over time? Do you notice it? Do you? [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=1851.9799999999998s)]

*  you know, he was in a great situation. I mean, I think timing, situation, work ethic, [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=1866.94s)]
*  you know, his talent, his brain, like a lot of things have to come together. Like if you look [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=1874.6200000000001s)]
*  at really successful people, you know, they're obviously talented in whatever their field is, [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=1880.06s)]

*  Yeah, team like just a yeah. And I mean, being with Bill and Josh McDaniels and their defense [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=1889.34s)]
*  was unbelievable when he first got there. And obviously he was good too. And he grew with that [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=1895.1799999999998s)]
*  and he became the team. But, you know, you look at a lot of these quarterbacks that get into the [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=1899.82s)]
*  league early and they're just, you know, they're on bad teams. They don't have a lot of talent [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=1904.62s)]
*  around them. The coaches, coaches kind of maybe getting fired or coming in and starting over. So [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=1908.6999999999998s)]
*  and not to take away from Tom, because I mean, what he's done is it will probably never be done [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=1914.9399999999998s)]
*  again. You know, but he came into a really, really good situation. And to his credit, he took [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=1920.3799999999999s)]
*  advantage of it, you know, better than anybody could. Is there like anything that he possesses? [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=1927.1s)]
*  Does it seem like he's magic when you're around, like when you see him or something, or is it just? [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=1932.2199999999998s)]
*  Well, he's aging backwards. Right. Yeah, it is pretty, pretty magnificent. I mean, it is. Yeah. [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=1937.1s)]

*  to be able to get paddled. Yeah, bro. And this dude, he would put it on you. And then a friend of [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=1953.98s)]
*  mine died not too long ago. This, this kid died or he's an adult now, but he was a kid when I, [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=1958.3s)]
*  when I met him because I was a kid and I went to his funeral and Benjamin Brady was there, dude. [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=1962.6200000000001s)]

*  or something like that, and he had a fricking, he was vaping, I think. And he was just like [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=1973.1s)]
*  chilling at his funeral. It's so different to see like people of like authority whenever you're [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=1978.3s)]
*  younger and now like you're grown and you see him now and it's like, you're just a regular, [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=1982.62s)]
*  just a regular dude. Yeah. You're eating crackers. Like what are you doing, man? Where's your paddle? [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=1986.9399999999998s)]

*  mean, I just, that's just kind of what I did. Did you like, were you like an instigator at all in [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=2011.74s)]
*  class or you were like, you were just chill? Just chill. Yeah. I mean, I didn't, I mean, no, yeah. [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=2018.6200000000001s)]

*  wanted to do the right thing. I wanted to, I mean, towards the end of high school, I stopped caring [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=2027.9s)]
*  so much about my grades and stuff, but like I went from like A's and B's to like a C plus, a few [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=2032.8600000000001s)]
*  classes. Yeah. That's fun though. Isn't that fun that last year and a half you're like, I think [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=2038.6200000000001s)]

*  high school and you kind of realize there's that moment where it's like, you realize that the group, [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=2066.7s)]
*  you don't have those crazy grades. That's going to do anything for you. Or you have a path with a [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=2071.74s)]
*  sport or with a profession already. And you're like, oh man. And I think that's probably part, [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=2076.38s)]
*  that's probably the part of the problem. Like I figured out like, this doesn't matter. Right. [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=2081.98s)]
*  This isn't what I'm going to be doing. Like I just need to get through this part of it. [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=2086.2200000000003s)]

*  so they're doing more stuff. You know, there was pressure when I first got out, but I mean, [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=3304.86s)]
*  that's gone now. So it's just kind of just. I've always said, like, hey, like things will start [[00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=3310.46s)]
*  to come. Like, I mean, I'm not going to just sit on my butt forever, and I'm not doing that. So [[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=3316.2200000000003s)]

*  right in the playoffs, maybe put in the playoff when they had Reggie Bush. I think the Saints had [[00:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=3327.58s)]
*  Reggie Bush. Oh, no, I was I was in Chicago that I played. I played him in Denver. I played him in [[00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=3331.7400000000002s)]
*  Denver. I played him in Denver. They had Reggie. And then in Chicago, we played him probably. I'm [[00:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=3337.5s)]
*  sure we played a couple of times. Was it interesting to see Drew Brees because he almost is like an [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=3342.94s)]
*  anomaly. Like, I remember when I first got to New Orleans, he came out and saw a comedy show. It was [[00:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=3346.38s)]
*  like his first week in town and Scott Fajita brought him out to see a comedy show one time. [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=3351.34s)]
*  Yeah, we won that game that Denver Denver Saints game. They missed a field goal. They missed like [[00:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=3355.66s)]
*  a 50 yard field goal, 40 yard field goal at the end to lose. And we won. Yeah, he's yeah, it's it's [[00:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=3363.1s)]
*  if you watch him, like he lifts his head up because he's short, he lifts his head up. [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=3372.38s)]
*  And he's looking through his face mask. And I'm like, I don't know, no idea. It's like insane. [[00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=3376.2999999999997s)]
*  And he's insanely accurate, insanely smart. It's yeah, he's got a ton of records. I mean, he's [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=3383.3399999999997s)]
*  people have a hard time catching him. Was it fun to hand the ball off and not have to pass? That's [[00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=3392.3s)]
*  what I would want to do. I feel like sometimes kind of relaxing. Yeah, like, yeah, like just, [[00:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=3397.82s)]
*  you know, you don't even have to think. But I mean, a lot of the run plays have checks on them. [[00:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=3403.1000000000004s)]
*  You've got to go the other way. You've got to point a mic. I mean, there's very few like we call them [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=3406.7000000000003s)]
*  call and runs like just car plays. Like you just go up there, you call it and you just go up there [[00:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=3412.38s)]
*  and say, hey, blue 80, blue 80 said, you just hand it off. And there's a handful of those in [[00:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=3416.38s)]
*  the game plan. But I mean, not many. There's probably fewer in today's game than I had. [[00:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=3420.94s)]
*  Do you ever hand it off to a guy and you're like, man, this guy's fuck, dude, they're going to kill [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=3426.14s)]
*  this guy. Oh, yeah. That's awesome. Yeah. You hand it off and be like, this is going nowhere. [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=3428.94s)]
*  Good luck, bro. Good luck. Damn, bro. That's freaking wild, man. You had that thing a couple [[00:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=3435.66s)]
*  weeks ago. They were talking about the mask with the kids and the superintendent or the would you [[00:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=3443.7400000000002s)]
*  really be a superintendent? I'd be on the school board. I'm going to be I want to be on the school [[00:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=3447.5s)]
*  board. I'll vote for you, man. I would help you campaign. I appreciate it. In my district, it's not [[00:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=3450.62s)]
*  I can't run until 2024. So what is it? 20? Why? Because you have to live there for a long time? [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=3457.5s)]
*  No, just because like that's how the terms are. So I think it's a four year term, I think I'm [[00:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=3465.3399999999997s)]
*  guessing. And the last vote was in 2000. So the guy in my district isn't up until 2024. So I've got [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=3470.06s)]

*  there. Yeah. But it's people have been supportive. And you know, Williamson County, I think is going [[00:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=3490.94s)]
*  through it right now with the mass situation and everything else. And it's it's going to be [[00:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=3497.82s)]
*  interesting to see what happens in the school systems down there. Yeah, it's kind of it's kind [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=3504.3s)]
*  of wild thinking about like kids having to wear that's kind of almost the scariest thing. I feel [[00:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=3508.54s)]
*  like some people say, well, kids don't know it's an issue if you don't tell them it's an issue. [[00:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=3513.1000000000004s)]
*  And some of that I get but also like, I feel like if I have a mascot, I can't I don't get the same [[00:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=3517.82s)]
*  feelings from people. I don't get the same intuition. Yeah. And also it's like children are [[00:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=3523.9s)]
*  like the least like, it just seems it seems ridiculous. Yeah. And you know, I mean, now, [[00:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=3528.78s)]
*  you know, that's what they're spinning now. If you go on CNN, like, it's like, all right, [[00:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=3535.82s)]
*  you know, we've got outrageous number of kids getting getting sick and stuff. And then if you [[00:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=3540.5400000000004s)]
*  go to a different side, it's like, well, they're, you know, the survival rate for kids is 99.9%. So [[00:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=3545.82s)]
*  it's like, you get it from both sides. And in my in, you know, I got pinned on the no mass side, [[00:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=3551.7400000000002s)]
*  which I'm fine with that. And that's for my kids. I don't want them to wear masks in school. Yeah. [[00:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=3558.14s)]
*  I think it's it's hard enough being in school. It's hard enough, you know, going through that, [[00:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=3562.22s)]
*  that day through five to have to have a mask on and learn how to read and write and talk and do [[00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=3567.58s)]
*  all this stuff. With that being said, like, if you want to send your kid to school with a mask, [[00:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=3573.8199999999997s)]
*  that's that's on you. Yeah, I'm fine with it. I got no issues. If you want to get the vaccine, [[00:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=3579.18s)]
*  get the vaccine. Yeah. I just don't think we can make a mandate for, you know, K through five, [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=3583.5s)]
*  like, hey, you have to wear a mask. That was my whole thing. Like, you can't mandate that. Right. [[00:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=3589.66s)]
*  And they and they they gave they gave everyone you can opt out. I mean, they they figured that [[00:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=3594.62s)]
*  part out. So I mean, we opted out. But I just don't want to get pinned like, all right, I'm [[00:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=3599.7400000000002s)]
*  100 percent against this. And I'm I'm against it for my own being. But if you have a different [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=3607.5s)]
*  opinion, I'm more than willing to listen and I'm more than willing to support whatever decision [[01:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=3613.5s)]
*  you want to make. Yeah, totally. I think it's interesting sometimes how if you say anything [[01:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=3617.82s)]
*  that is even like contrary or not even contrary, but like it's like if you want to raise your hand [[01:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=3621.82s)]
*  and even talk about stuff, you immediately get pinned on like you're this outlier, you're this [[01:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=3626.86s)]
*  like anarchist. And I think a lot of that is goes back to what we're talking to earlier. It's just [[01:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=3633.1s)]
*  like anything that people can click on. It's like they just want that's all they care about making. [[01:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=3637.5s)]
*  They don't really care about making a conversation. And it's and it's all just extreme over here, [[01:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=3641.2599999999998s)]
*  extreme over here. Like there's no like middle ground anymore. There's no common sense. Like I [[01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=3646.7s)]
*  don't under like there are a lot of you, but those people know what's to well and they don't want to [[01:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=3650.94s)]
*  talk. Those people don't want to talk because you're going to get destroyed on one side or the other. [[01:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=3655.2599999999998s)]
*  But I think you're right. I think there's a lot of people in this middle ground that do have common [[01:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=3659.66s)]
*  sense that do want to live in this middle area and don't want to be on these extremes. They just, [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=3664.7s)]
*  you know, I mean, it's not worth it anymore to say anything. Yeah, it's like, [[01:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=3671.18s)]
*  that's the weird part. I'm not gonna say anything. I don't want to deal with this either side of this. [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=3674.3799999999997s)]
*  Yeah, man. Sometimes I get afraid to speak up man about certain things. Yeah. But also sometimes I [[01:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=3679.58s)]
*  get afraid. This is why I get afraid Jay, because sometimes I, um, you can get another water just [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=3684.54s)]
*  so he has it. Thank you, Sean. Um, sometimes I get afraid because I just don't, I, sometimes my brain [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=3690.14s)]
*  doesn't work as well as, as fast as I need it to. So it's like, I don't want to say something until [[01:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=3695.1s)]
*  I know exactly what it is. And people don't give you room to like, Oh no, you say one thing wrong. [[01:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=3701.02s)]
*  It's over. You don't get a second chance. Like, well that's impossible. So the only people that [[01:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=3706.38s)]
*  are even allowed to speak anymore then are people reading off teleprompters who are [[01:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=3711.66s)]
*  knowing exactly what they're about to say. Or maybe like Ben Shapiro, who's like somehow, [[01:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=3715.2599999999998s)]
*  or Jordan Peterson, who were like computers and they're able to get it from here to here. [[01:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=3720.06s)]
*  Process it just like that. It's crazy man. Seeing some of that. And there's a lot of people out [[01:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=3724.46s)]
*  there that just don't want to say anything because they don't want to get canceled. They don't want [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=3728.3799999999997s)]
*  to lose sponsors. They don't want to lose their job. So like there's like, Hey, I can't say anything. [[01:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=3732.14s)]
*  Yeah, I can't because I've got to feed my family. I need to go to work. [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=3736.3799999999997s)]
*  Yeah. And that's kind of interesting too. It's like at least, yeah, maybe sometimes I'll take [[01:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=3741.74s)]
*  that for granted. Like I'm in a place where at least I could say some stuff if I want to. [[01:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=3745.58s)]
*  But I worry though, if I say like, not say certain things, but like, like the other day we did a [[01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=3749.3399999999997s)]
*  Netflix special and that we taped at the Rhyme and they, like a couple of days before, like [[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=3754.06s)]
*  everybody needs to be vaccinated or have a negative test. And it was like, you know, everybody had [[01:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=3758.94s)]
*  bought their tickets knowing that they either had a, just knowing both things. I'm willing to go, [[01:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=3764.46s)]
*  I've been vaccinated or I'm willing to go and I haven't. Yeah. So that was really interesting [[01:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=3769.9s)]
*  because then it's like this, they're like, well, this is kind of our production that we're putting [[01:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=3775.58s)]
*  on. So it's like, you want to work with the rules. People have already bought their tickets. They're [[01:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=3779.34s)]
*  coming. You want them to be able to be a part of it and see the show. But it's interesting when [[01:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=3783.26s)]
*  businesses kind of start to have mandates and whether they're worried about what the social [[01:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=3788.3s)]
*  media repercussions will be. And that's, that's so real. That's a, that's the world we live in now. [[01:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=3794.3s)]
*  Now it's weird, man. It is weird. It's really weird. And we're at the point too, we're at that, [[01:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=3800.3s)]
*  we're at that, we're still, I think in that period where we're navigating what that is and what it [[01:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=3804.46s)]
*  means. And if it means anything, like, you know, two years ago, a tweet, somebody said something, [[01:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=3808.46s)]
*  it meant everything. And now it's starting to be a little bit like people don't even pay attention [[01:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=3813.98s)]
*  that much. No. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, Twitter, I think Twitter, like it's just about quantity. [[01:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=3817.42s)]
*  People are just spitting out stuff. I mean, and it's just gone. Like there's a next thought, [[01:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=3823.42s)]
*  the next thought, the next thought. Yeah. I don't think Twitter has, I mean, there's impactful people [[01:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=3827.18s)]
*  that tweet for sure. But like, I think a lot of Twitter is just, it's just, you know, garbage. [[01:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=3832.94s)]
*  Yeah. It's just a weird chatterbox. It's like, it's almost like Stephen A Smith, but in like a [[01:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=3839.18s)]
*  business. Yeah. Just, just firing off stuff. Yeah. Just word garbage. And it's like anything that [[01:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=3843.3399999999997s)]
*  will pick up steam. Exactly. But it's going to be, it's going to be interesting like 10 years from [[01:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=3849.9s)]
*  now, like we look back in this space and time and like what, what we're going to think about. [[01:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=3854.2200000000003s)]
*  I don't know. I don't, I don't want to speculate, but it's going to be, it's going to be, it's going [[01:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=3860.06s)]
*  to be interesting because you know, you look back at it, you remember like, like Y2K. Yeah. Oh yeah. [[01:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=3863.26s)]
*  That was like the first big thing. Yeah. Like the world was ending, like banks, banks were going to [[01:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=3869.26s)]
*  be like finished. People were buying lambs, dude. People were buying like lambs and stuff for, you [[01:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=3873.6600000000003s)]
*  know, same people were insane. Yeah. Banks were going to be done. Yeah. All your money will be [[01:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=3879.18s)]
*  gone. You wake up like the whole thing. I wonder if that was like the first thing that really started [[01:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=3883.18s)]
*  to scare people. I don't know. I don't know. But I mean, you're going to be a pepper here soon. So [[01:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=3888.3799999999997s)]
*  like you're good. Oh dude, I can't wait, bro. I'll be just sitting there with a Kindle, [[01:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=3892.7s)]
*  fucking watching old Joe Rogan's just doing all that kid, man. This eating fucking Jay Cutler [[01:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=3896.8599999999997s)]

*  man? We'll get to a couple of questions here for you, Jay. [[01:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=3908.54s)]
*  Hi Theo and Jay. I am so excited to know that Jay is going to be on Theo's podcast. That's awesome. [[01:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=3914.46s)]
*  Jay, oh my gosh, learn everything you can from him. He's awesome. My question is, [[01:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=3923.1s)]
*  a for Jay Cutler, my son started playing football this year. He's nine. He's a big boy. And I'm [[01:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=3928.14s)]
*  wondering what some of your encouraging words might be for a first time football player, [[01:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=3934.94s)]
*  first year, and anything for the moms out there who are watching our [[01:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=3939.1800000000003s)]
*  sweet little thick boys getting blasted on the line. Okay, gang, uncut. [[01:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=3943.9s)]
*  That's tough. I know whenever my mom like when I started playing football and even like whenever [[01:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=3951.1800000000003s)]
*  I got into the NFL, like she was an absolute nightmare on game day. Oh my gosh, so nervous. [[01:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=3955.98s)]

*  the same spot kind of where you could see her? Yeah, I mean, I always knew our parents were. And [[01:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=3976.2200000000003s)]
*  then we had a box when I got into the NFL. So I mean, I always knew where they were. [[01:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=3981.82s)]
*  Um, and looking back on it now, I'm like, I get it, because I have kids, right? And they, [[01:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=3986.54s)]

*  get it, you know, I got it. But I was like, Hey, I'm gonna be fine. Like, I've got the second care [[01:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=4010.86s)]

*  just, you know, that undue pressure on them and you know, all those things. So I'm sorry to all the [[01:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=4045.4199999999996s)]
*  all the moms out there. I know how how difficult it is to do that. And you just gotta encourage [[01:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=4051.2599999999998s)]
*  your son as much as you possibly can. Positive, positive, positive. It's in any sport when they [[01:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=4056.9399999999996s)]

*  I remember trying to like touch her panties and stuff. And I got so nervous, dude, that I just [[01:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=4449.42s)]
*  took her home, bro. I remember, dude, I remembered she got out of the car and even she was shocked. [[01:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=4453.42s)]

*  even sometimes playing basketball, like if they ever put me at point guard, I'd be so nervous. [[01:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=4479.58s)]
*  I couldn't handle it. I would just shoot it from half court. Like you just didn't want to mess up. [[01:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=4483.34s)]
*  Just like, yeah, just get it out of my hands. So like if I do this, you know, then I'm okay. [[01:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=4487.26s)]

*  all right, I'm ready to do this. Like, let's go do this. Like, um, it, you know, didn't want to fail. [[01:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=4506.540000000001s)]
*  And I know there's guys out there that are scared of failing. Um, and there was probably, [[01:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=4513.9800000000005s)]

*  weeks, like you give yourself the best opportunity on Sunday to be ready. And if you do that, like [[01:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=4530.46s)]

*  don't play a sport, then you got to work at the airport usually by the baggage. Do something. And [[01:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=4673.26s)]
*  it's like, there's not like, so to be tall, cause you're standing out from the crowd to not have [[01:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=4678.14s)]

*  I mean, it's probably the NFL players that come from different backgrounds in basketball or [[01:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=4727.179999999999s)]

*  you know, reading and writing is, I'm sure it's less now than what it used to be just because [[01:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=4748.86s)]
*  of the education and I mean, social media, like they all have social media. So they probably all [[01:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=4754.54s)]
*  can read it right now. I'm probably wrong. No, I think by, I think now you're probably right. I [[01:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=4759.82s)]

*  years of being out of their respective leagues. And I know that's not the case with you, Jay, [[01:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa4yi4lAj74&t=4803.66s)]
