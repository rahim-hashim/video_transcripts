**Theo Von - This Past Weekend:** [October 29, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0u70scMXeI)
*  Today's guest, Jeepers. I've never had an interview where it was not a [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0u70scMXeI&t=0.0s)]
*  conversation really. So I think it's, you know, and I'm saying this now because I [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0u70scMXeI&t=9.82s)]
*  it was hard to get a word in. I am grateful for this man's time but I was [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0u70scMXeI&t=15.120000000000001s)]
*  happy when it ended. This man is a former governor of Minnesota. He is a [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0u70scMXeI&t=22.08s)]
*  unique man and he will tell you all about it. I am very grateful for his time [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0u70scMXeI&t=30.839999999999996s)]
*  and I mean that and I learned a lot that I can do a better job as an interviewer [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0u70scMXeI&t=38.2s)]
*  I think for sure. I did learn that but he makes some really interesting points [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0u70scMXeI&t=43.599999999999994s)]
*  and he does talk about some things that I'm really excited to that I was [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0u70scMXeI&t=49.36s)]
*  grateful to get to speak for to hear him speak on. I'm not trying to rinse the [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0u70scMXeI&t=53.760000000000005s)]
*  dude but I didn't get a chance to say anything so I felt like at the very [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0u70scMXeI&t=59.760000000000005s)]
*  least I deserve that. I'm very happy to have today's guest Mr. Jesse Ventura [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0u70scMXeI&t=66.32s)]
*  I'll shine that light on me. I'll sit and tell you my stories. Shine on me. And I will find a song I've been singing just for you. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0u70scMXeI&t=79.28s)]
*  You ever see these ads on TV now where they got the big lawsuit against 3M [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0u70scMXeI&t=100.28s)]
*  because the hearing devices for the military in combat apparently were [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0u70scMXeI&t=111.4s)]
*  defective? I haven't seen them. Well they got ads on TV all the time. It's a [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0u70scMXeI&t=116.16s)]
*  class-action lawsuit. I see those lawsuits. Yeah, that if you're deaf and you served in the [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0u70scMXeI&t=120.1s)]
*  military blah blah blah blah blah blah blah and you had 3M made these things [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0u70scMXeI&t=124.8s)]
*  you stick in your ears I guess that are supposed to save your hearing. And what [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0u70scMXeI&t=128.92000000000002s)]
*  happened? Well no and they didn't work function right so now there's a lawsuit [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0u70scMXeI&t=132.28s)]
*  on it which is all fine and dandy but I sit back and go well gee what about us [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0u70scMXeI&t=135.68s)]
*  Vietnam guys that nobody gave us nothing for our ears. We're all deaf today and in [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0u70scMXeI&t=141.36s)]
*  our part and in my and what it tells me is this how different the combat was in [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0u70scMXeI&t=148.48000000000002s)]
*  the Middle East than Vietnam because in Vietnam you couldn't wear earplugs you [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0u70scMXeI&t=154.68s)]

*  people do is cover the coasts nobody gets a midwestern perspective of nothing and we're [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0u70scMXeI&t=1639.54s)]
*  the heart of America we're the heart of America you know so uh they agreed so go over to channel [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0u70scMXeI&t=1644.9799999999998s)]
*  two here in the Twin Cities I provided 30 jobs or something because they had to hire all these [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0u70scMXeI&t=1653.2199999999998s)]

*  a sudden we get a phone call here's the phone call oh let me add MSNBC had just hired Phil Donahue [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0u70scMXeI&t=1696.98s)]
*  the king of daytime he was now on at night he was their highest rated show Phil likewise opposed [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0u70scMXeI&t=1705.1399999999999s)]
*  the invasion of Iraq yeah and said it publicly so had I we get a phone call John my subordinate [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0u70scMXeI&t=1713.06s)]
*  that the right communication guy I didn't get the he got the call here's the call um this is so is [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0u70scMXeI&t=1722.1799999999998s)]
*  it true governor Ventura doesn't support the invasion of Iraq John oh no he's vehemently [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0u70scMXeI&t=1728.8999999999999s)]
*  opposed to it he's a Vietnam veteran he said this is Vietnam all over again this is crap this is [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0u70scMXeI&t=1736.1799999999998s)]
*  nation building is they didn't attack us Iraq didn't attack us on 9-eleven yeah why are we [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0u70scMXeI&t=1741.7s)]
*  invading Iraq yeah a lot of you know and and so then the next question does Connecticut know about [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0u70scMXeI&t=1747.78s)]
*  this well here's the tie-in MSNBC stood for Microsoft NBC at that time okay it was a [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0u70scMXeI&t=1754.82s)]
*  partnership between Microsoft and NBC who owned NBC at that time yes general electric [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0u70scMXeI&t=1765.54s)]
*  oh really general electric is one of the biggest war profiteers in the world damn they are they are [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0u70scMXeI&t=1773.22s)]
*  the military industrial complex and part of it because they have all those contracts with them [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0u70scMXeI&t=1780.1s)]
*  wow everything is built by GE to go to war yeah a lot of it right oh I probably have a so do they [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0u70scMXeI&t=1784.6599999999999s)]
*  want one of their announcers on tv opposing a war not a chance damn exactly so that was that [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0u70scMXeI&t=1791.38s)]
*  does Connecticut know about this was the second question we respond or John responded I don't know [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0u70scMXeI&t=1798.74s)]
*  pause here's the big question is there any chance he'd change his mind wow John said I don't think [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0u70scMXeI&t=1806.98s)]
*  so he said I've seen the governor change his mind where because he wasn't educated on something [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0u70scMXeI&t=1816.1000000000001s)]
*  well enough and when he got educated he took a different viewpoint right but he said this is war [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0u70scMXeI&t=1821.6200000000001s)]
*  he's a veteran he's opposed to it he's a Vietnam veteran you ain't going to change his mind guess [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0u70scMXeI&t=1827.14s)]
*  what I didn't go on the air and guess what Phil Donahue got pulled damn they pulled both of us [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0u70scMXeI&t=1833.06s)]
*  have you ever heard of a network pulling their highest rated show no never but they did because [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0u70scMXeI&t=1839.38s)]
*  they wanted no negative to invading Iraq on the mainstream media so that's how powerful those [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0u70scMXeI&t=1845.06s)]
*  tie-ins are between like these companies and the corporations and the mainstream media and the [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0u70scMXeI&t=1851.3s)]
*  government yeah and the government so do you feel sometimes it used to feel like one thing is tougher [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0u70scMXeI&t=1855.46s)]
*  as I've learned more as I as I get older and just learn more sometimes it almost you're going to find [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0u70scMXeI&t=1862.1799999999998s)]

*  sometimes that it's this almost a more blissful value and not like they say knowledge is power [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0u70scMXeI&t=1885.3s)]
*  and sometimes it just almost hurts me sometimes the more I learn stuff sometimes it feels it makes me [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0u70scMXeI&t=1891.06s)]
*  feel debilitated sometimes but you have to know you can't live a life in my opinion you can't [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0u70scMXeI&t=1895.54s)]

*  know what angers me right now the most of anything our country is being governed and stopped from [[01:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0u70scMXeI&t=4413.0599999999995s)]
*  doing anything by those 50 people in the senate the 50 republicans right i don't know well then [[01:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0u70scMXeI&t=4419.0599999999995s)]
*  they got to do that shit they call where you need 60 votes or whatever what do you mean you don't [[01:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0u70scMXeI&t=4426.66s)]
*  know you better start knowing i'm trying to anyway okay 50 republicans block everything right [[01:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0u70scMXeI&t=4430.98s)]
*  here's what pisses me off because there's an equal amount of senators two in each state yeah do you [[01:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0u70scMXeI&t=4438.0199999999995s)]
*  know those 50 republicans how much of the population they actually represent and they're stopping the [[01:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0u70scMXeI&t=4444.259999999999s)]
*  rest of the country they represent 21 percent of the population wow because you have states like [[01:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0u70scMXeI&t=4450.58s)]
*  north and south dakota that have the same senate two people as california as new york so they have [[01:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0u70scMXeI&t=4457.379999999999s)]
*  equal to them they can stop them that's insane now it was initially i know why it was done so it [[01:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0u70scMXeI&t=4466.5s)]
*  was equality amongst the 13 original states right but when california has a huge population and [[01:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0u70scMXeI&t=4473.14s)]
*  new york has a huge population how can they be equal to south dakota but then do you worry that [[01:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0u70scMXeI&t=4479.46s)]
*  by the way i see more south dakota license plates in mexico than i see in south dakota [[01:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0u70scMXeI&t=4486.74s)]
*  you know why that is because south dakota don't give a shit if you live there or not you can just [[01:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0u70scMXeI&t=4493.22s)]
*  license your car there so all these people from california that are supposed to bring them back [[01:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0u70scMXeI&t=4498.1s)]
*  for emission tests because they still have them there you'd have to drive the whole baha to do [[01:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0u70scMXeI&t=4502.34s)]
*  that every year well they leave them down there and they just register them in south dakota wow [[01:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0u70scMXeI&t=4506.66s)]
*  so you see south dakota plates all over the baha like i said there's more south dakotans in the [[01:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0u70scMXeI&t=4511.38s)]
*  baha than there is in south dakota what um you also you talk a lot about south dakota just wants [[01:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0u70scMXeI&t=4516.42s)]
*  the money they don't give a crap where you live they'll license you and that's great fine no [[01:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0u70scMXeI&t=4523.3s)]
*  problem for me yeah a lot of places have different little loopholes like that sure it's the way to [[01:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0u70scMXeI&t=4528.42s)]
*  make money um what about um you talk a lot i've heard you speak about uh about tax at the point [[01:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0u70scMXeI&t=4532.9800000000005s)]
*  of purchase you know which i've long been a proponent of yes that that's the way we should [[01:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0u70scMXeI&t=4540.26s)]
*  do it it would keep all these loopholes and all this bullshit everybody would pay their tax and [[01:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0u70scMXeI&t=4544.1s)]
*  you'd live within your means right how do you explain that to people who don't understand [[01:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0u70scMXeI&t=4549.38s)]
*  what it is when i really got into it it was i think representative army from texas dick army [[01:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0u70scMXeI&t=4554.18s)]
*  was his name he brought i learned it he brought it i learned it when he brought it up a national [[01:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0u70scMXeI&t=4560.9800000000005s)]
*  tax is like a state sales tax what it would do you could throw away all the records you have to [[01:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0u70scMXeI&t=4567.3s)]
*  keep for seven years of income you wouldn't have to keep them you would never be audited again [[01:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0u70scMXeI&t=4575.38s)]
*  all of that would be gone the tax at that time would have been 12 percent [[01:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0u70scMXeI&t=4581.86s)]
*  well that would then keep our government on budget with the economy they'd have to ensure [[01:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0u70scMXeI&t=4589.62s)]
*  the economy stays good otherwise they don't get their money do they right but when they have an [[01:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0u70scMXeI&t=4595.06s)]
*  income tax they get their money whether the economy's good or not see this way they would [[01:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0u70scMXeI&t=4599.3s)]
*  be directly correlated with the economy now it would be then maybe it'd be a little more now but [[01:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0u70scMXeI&t=4605.22s)]
*  12 percent's a lot less than i'm paying now yeah so you would pay that at the point of purchase now [[01:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0u70scMXeI&t=4611.620000000001s)]
*  now businesses are already doing that so you as an individual would never have to keep a tax return [[01:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0u70scMXeI&t=4618.42s)]
*  again you'd never have to file one less stress everything you do would be done at the point of [[01:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0u70scMXeI&t=4625.38s)]
*  purchase buying right now your car would call and it would make you more conscious of what you're [[01:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0u70scMXeI&t=4630.66s)]
*  living in your means because you'd have you'd see a price on the car that you go holy shit it it's [[01:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0u70scMXeI&t=4637.06s)]
*  up 12 percent because i have to pay a 12 percent sales tax to the federal government [[01:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0u70scMXeI&t=4642.98s)]
*  well guess who else would pay that tourists everybody right now tourists don't pay [[01:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0u70scMXeI&t=4648.099999999999s)]

*  of udt's now here's the tradition we came about because in world war ii you know those landing [[01:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0u70scMXeI&t=6107.7s)]
*  boats with the marines that flopped the front down and the marines charge off on the beach [[01:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0u70scMXeI&t=6119.86s)]
*  well they did one of them and there was a sandbar and when the boats went down they hit the sandbar [[01:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0u70scMXeI&t=6124.98s)]
*  when they dropped their front i forget hundreds of marines ran off and drowned because they ran [[01:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0u70scMXeI&t=6131.94s)]
*  into deep water nobody knew the sandbar was there so they needed to form the underwater demolition [[01:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0u70scMXeI&t=6138.66s)]
*  teams now the blowing up came from obstacles the enemy would put in the water to stop those we [[01:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0u70scMXeI&t=6145.78s)]
*  would blow them up but we also would recon the beach to show where the boats could go in so they [[01:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0u70scMXeI&t=6152.82s)]
*  wouldn't hit a sandbar and potentially kill these brave marines that are charging the beach [[01:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0u70scMXeI&t=6160.1s)]
*  and don't get me wrong they i wouldn't do it they're brave as hell yeah i'll go in before [[01:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0u70scMXeI&t=6165.860000000001s)]

*  like we do from prep work but what became a tradition especially in the pacific was that [[01:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0u70scMXeI&t=6176.900000000001s)]
*  when the marines were going to land the udt watched the frogmen the movie with richard [[01:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0u70scMXeI&t=6184.82s)]
*  widmark when the udt would do the reconnaissance at some point during the reconnaissance one one or [[01:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0u70scMXeI&t=6189.86s)]
*  two frogmen with a pre-made sign they carried with them would skin up onto the beach to the high [[01:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0u70scMXeI&t=6198.34s)]
*  water mark they'd pound the sign in before they left in the dark in the morning when the marines [[01:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0u70scMXeI&t=6205.38s)]
*  had hit there would be a sign on the beach welcome us marine corps udt whatever team it was wow so [[01:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0u70scMXeI&t=6212.5s)]
*  we would welcome the marines to the same we got there first that was the way they knew we were [[01:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0u70scMXeI&t=6220.9s)]
*  welcoming them so when the marines claimed their first ashore we've been there before now granted [[01:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0u70scMXeI&t=6226.34s)]
*  we don't stay yeah we get in and get out yeah but we make sure it's okay for them to charge the next [[01:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0u70scMXeI&t=6234.26s)]
