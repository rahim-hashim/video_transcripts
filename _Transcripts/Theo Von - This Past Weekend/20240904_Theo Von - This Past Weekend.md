*  And you'd go in there and some lady would come just, just stumbling out of the [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76bnJl2kklw&t=219.44s)]
*  Christmas tree and she'd be like, Hey, hey, and gave it to you. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76bnJl2kklw&t=223.95999999999998s)]

*  It's like a water skin. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76bnJl2kklw&t=240.48000000000002s)]
*  It's like, it makes me feel like a frontiersman. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76bnJl2kklw&t=242.04s)]
*  Never. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76bnJl2kklw&t=245.64000000000001s)]

*  It has a very, at that point it gets a, like a camelback vibe. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76bnJl2kklw&t=253.76s)]
*  It's like a fucking bagpipe. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76bnJl2kklw&t=257.24s)]
*  I'm not surprised if some of those bagpipe players aren't just, uh, well, you can [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76bnJl2kklw&t=264.44s)]

*  It's right. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76bnJl2kklw&t=269.72s)]

*  And you think you might bring two bagpipes. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76bnJl2kklw&t=272.72s)]

*  No way. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76bnJl2kklw&t=296.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76bnJl2kklw&t=296.52s)]
*  Cause it's kind of like, I told him I bought like a waterbed pillow. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76bnJl2kklw&t=296.8s)]
*  And you could just lean over and just. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76bnJl2kklw&t=301.04s)]

*  He gets up there and he's like, I want to say to everybody right now, or somebody out [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76bnJl2kklw&t=1204.4s)]

*  That was his finishing move, I think. [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76bnJl2kklw&t=1236.0s)]
*  The double eclair? [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76bnJl2kklw&t=1237.2s)]

*  It's good. [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76bnJl2kklw&t=1398.4s)]
*  Primordial. [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76bnJl2kklw&t=1399.4s)]
*  I think it would be very... [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76bnJl2kklw&t=1400.8000000000002s)]
*  Maybe... [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76bnJl2kklw&t=1401.8000000000002s)]

*  What about you, man? [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76bnJl2kklw&t=1414.8000000000002s)]
*  What do you think? [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76bnJl2kklw&t=1415.8000000000002s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76bnJl2kklw&t=1416.8000000000002s)]
*  Well, yours is fucking awesome. [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76bnJl2kklw&t=1417.8000000000002s)]

*  Well, I've always had a concept for a wrestler that doesn't touch anybody. [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76bnJl2kklw&t=1420.8000000000002s)]
*  He's just telepathic. [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76bnJl2kklw&t=1426.8000000000002s)]
*  So I think my move would be like... [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76bnJl2kklw&t=1429.2s)]
*  Grab somebody by the neck from across the ring. [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76bnJl2kklw&t=1431.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76bnJl2kklw&t=1434.2s)]
*  Then slam them that way. [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76bnJl2kklw&t=1435.2s)]
*  And then a string pulls them up. [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76bnJl2kklw&t=1436.2s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76bnJl2kklw&t=1438.2s)]
*  See, but there's no wrestler that does that, I don't think. [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76bnJl2kklw&t=1439.2s)]
*  Not yet. [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76bnJl2kklw&t=1442.2s)]
*  I think that... [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76bnJl2kklw&t=1443.2s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76bnJl2kklw&t=1444.2s)]
*  Well, they put me in the game. [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76bnJl2kklw&t=1445.2s)]
*  In the WWE game? [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76bnJl2kklw&t=1446.2s)]
*  Yes, sir. [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76bnJl2kklw&t=1447.2s)]
*  No way. [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76bnJl2kklw&t=1448.2s)]
*  Do you have a code to get you? [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76bnJl2kklw&t=1449.2s)]
*  I think I'm like five bucks. [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76bnJl2kklw&t=1450.2s)]
*  I don't know how much I am. [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76bnJl2kklw&t=1453.2s)]
*  I'm worth about five bucks. [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76bnJl2kklw&t=1454.2s)]
*  No, dude. [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76bnJl2kklw&t=1455.2s)]
*  I heard that... [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76bnJl2kklw&t=1456.2s)]
*  Look at this stud, dude. [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76bnJl2kklw&t=1457.6000000000001s)]

*  So that seems a little... [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76bnJl2kklw&t=1460.6000000000001s)]
*  Wait, you could be Bert and Ernie? [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76bnJl2kklw&t=1462.6000000000001s)]

*  It is kind of funny. [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76bnJl2kklw&t=1553.92s)]
*  Some of that is how it works. [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76bnJl2kklw&t=1554.92s)]
*  It's like, yeah, if you don't feel some ambiance from women or if you don't feel like seen [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76bnJl2kklw&t=1555.92s)]
*  maybe in the world or something, then you're like, well, I have to make myself be seen [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76bnJl2kklw&t=1560.92s)]
*  more. [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76bnJl2kklw&t=1565.92s)]
*  Sure. [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76bnJl2kklw&t=1566.92s)]
*  And so you create more. [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76bnJl2kklw&t=1567.92s)]
*  That comes, I guess, like it's kind of a weird way of like, oh, I want to express myself [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76bnJl2kklw&t=1568.92s)]
*  more because I become more introverted learning how to do that. [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76bnJl2kklw&t=1574.0800000000002s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76bnJl2kklw&t=1578.0600000000002s)]
*  Like. [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76bnJl2kklw&t=1579.0600000000002s)]
*  So tell me a little bit more. [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76bnJl2kklw&t=1580.0600000000002s)]

*  So like I wanted to make music. [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76bnJl2kklw&t=1582.0600000000002s)]
*  But the only way to make music is like to do it. [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76bnJl2kklw&t=1583.9s)]
*  And so I just sat in my room with audacity and played the guitar and wrote songs. [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76bnJl2kklw&t=1587.68s)]
*  And it's like, I want people to hear my music, but the way I do that is learn as much as [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76bnJl2kklw&t=1592.88s)]
*  I can by myself in my room and then present. [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76bnJl2kklw&t=1597.84s)]
*  Not exactly. [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76bnJl2kklw&t=1601.04s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76bnJl2kklw&t=1602.04s)]
*  It's it's an interesting thing like taking the time to learn a skill or become an outlier. [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76bnJl2kklw&t=1603.04s)]
*  I guess why you probably got ten thousand hours behind it. [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76bnJl2kklw&t=1607.8s)]
*  But you know, it's an interesting thing. [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76bnJl2kklw&t=1610.76s)]
*  Yeah, I think that's something that part of people don't maybe I don't know if they don't [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76bnJl2kklw&t=1613.4s)]
*  realize it, but yeah, there's a lot that goes into being good at something. [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76bnJl2kklw&t=1616.52s)]

*  But still, I would call them. [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76bnJl2kklw&t=1649.72s)]
*  But I'll never say, hey, I'm a call the cops because that would end up on the phone. [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76bnJl2kklw&t=1652.92s)]
*  I'm six naturally gifted fighters. [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76bnJl2kklw&t=1657.52s)]

*  But did there's so much fucking cool shit going on at any and that's a problem too like I remember [[01:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76bnJl2kklw&t=6091.94s)]
*  Like SoundCloud just first started and [[01:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76bnJl2kklw&t=6101.099999999999s)]
*  I was maybe one of the first [[01:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76bnJl2kklw&t=6105.62s)]
*  Artists to really like blow up strictly on SoundCloud [[01:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76bnJl2kklw&t=6109.7s)]
*  Really? I don't even know that SoundCloud. I think it was like 2013 [[01:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76bnJl2kklw&t=6114.22s)]
*  SoundCloud was [[01:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76bnJl2kklw&t=6119.58s)]
*  Going and I think 20 out of here, dude. I can't remember anything. I have such a Dory brain, but [[01:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76bnJl2kklw&t=6121.26s)]
*  Yeah, and it's so hard now I feel like for new artists [[01:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76bnJl2kklw&t=6128.9800000000005s)]
*  to [[01:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76bnJl2kklw&t=6134.46s)]
*  Because of the volume of music that's getting put on which is a fucking amazing thing. Oh 2007. I was way off [[01:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76bnJl2kklw&t=6135.740000000001s)]
*  That's when it started. It was really popping right? [[01:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76bnJl2kklw&t=6143.780000000001s)]
*  Things just start that means they open their doors. Yes, sir. Probably took five years [[01:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76bnJl2kklw&t=6147.06s)]
*  Type in when did SoundCloud really start popping? [[01:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76bnJl2kklw&t=6152.1s)]
*  Twenty twenty seventeen look at that chance the rapper Post Malone odd future. Oh, you're on that list [[01:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76bnJl2kklw&t=6159.54s)]
*  Yes, see I'm on the list. I think there you go. Isn't that cool? Yeah, super cool man, but [[01:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76bnJl2kklw&t=6165.14s)]
*  Yeah, it's hard now like to get discovered especially well [[01:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76bnJl2kklw&t=6170.339999999999s)]
*  It might be it's either easier or real hard because you can do something that really just tricks the algorithm and saying like [[01:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76bnJl2kklw&t=6174.179999999999s)]
*  People get like viral, you know super viral moments, but songs don't have to be viral to be awesome [[01:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76bnJl2kklw&t=6181.82s)]
*  and we miss out I feel like on so many like [[01:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76bnJl2kklw&t=6188.12s)]
*  artists that [[01:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76bnJl2kklw&t=6191.86s)]
*  Never [[01:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76bnJl2kklw&t=6194.219999999999s)]
*  You know so many talented people that never never that never get the algorithm going for them [[01:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76bnJl2kklw&t=6196.46s)]
*  But they're fucking killer and that's like the hard part is the volume of stuff and I like I'm a big advocate [[01:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76bnJl2kklw&t=6203.34s)]
*  Like the first recording software I got I think making music should be as cheap as it [[01:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76bnJl2kklw&t=6209.58s)]
*  Possibly can and you can get your ideas out like I use a free recording software [[01:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76bnJl2kklw&t=6216.62s)]
*  I had a $200 guitar I had a hundred dollar mic and I would sit in my room and fucking make these songs [[01:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76bnJl2kklw&t=6222.76s)]
*  I love that concept, but it's hard now because [[01:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76bnJl2kklw&t=6229.4400000000005s)]
*  it's it like I said, it's so fast and songs are viral for a couple days and then like [[01:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76bnJl2kklw&t=6233.6s)]
*  You you don't hear much after that, you know what I mean? [[01:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76bnJl2kklw&t=6242.08s)]
*  And that's right or a train comes through and take but that's what people people are like, let's make something that goes viral [[01:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76bnJl2kklw&t=6245.280000000001s)]
*  I just like I want people to fucking express themselves the way that it is and if you work [[01:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76bnJl2kklw&t=6250.8s)]
*  Super fucking hard and you go like I'm the luckiest dude in the world [[01:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76bnJl2kklw&t=6257.24s)]
