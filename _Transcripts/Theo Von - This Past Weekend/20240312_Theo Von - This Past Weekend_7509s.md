*  Today's guest is Mr. Dax Shepard. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=56.84s)]
*  I'm always amazed at those people that they find that live in, like they find them and [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=86.84s)]
*  the kids have been living in like a basement or... [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=93.92s)]
*  An Ohio basement. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=97.0s)]
*  It's generally an Ohio basement. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=98.04s)]
*  Yeah, I guess it's kind of like an Ohio pastime. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=99.56s)]
*  I don't want to say... [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=101.64s)]
*  Well, it says on the license plate, Ohio Buckeye State slash basement, captives state. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=102.96000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, dude. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=109.44s)]
*  What if in years from now... [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=110.44s)]
*  Sincerely, I've seen 12 of those stories over the years on the news and it's 100% of them [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=112.52000000000001s)]
*  have been in Ohio, like middle of Ohio. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=116.64s)]
*  Oh, definitely. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=119.36s)]
*  It's like, hey, they should do like always like, hey, show your basement, you know? [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=120.88s)]
*  Yeah, I think there should be like mandatory basement sweeps in Ohio. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=126.8s)]
*  Like you got taxes, you got the census, fuck it, task the census people with it. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=131.6s)]
*  Like just need to know how many folks are here. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=135.6s)]
*  We're going to have to peek in the basement. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=137.28s)]
*  Hey, I want those cellar doors open now, buddy. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=139.08s)]
*  Just wide open so we can just sniff around a little bit. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=143.44s)]
*  Nothing personal, just 12% of you have people in the basement. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=146.48s)]
*  And so it'd be irresponsible for us and that'd take a little gander down there. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=150.79999999999998s)]
*  I wonder if the world evolves so much that like things like that, like the basement, [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=156.16s)]
*  like basement people becomes like a mascot for like the city, like the city football [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=162.6s)]
*  team or something, you know, like the Cleveland basement people. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=169.84s)]
*  Does Louisiana have something that they over index in? [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=175.6s)]
*  Like when you're watching shows and they're like, and you're like, yeah, that's because [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=180.4s)]
*  Michigan has, I'm from Michigan. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=184.72s)]
*  I want to say 40% of date lines I watch where the woman is married, the husband. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=189.12s)]
*  Yeah, that's going to be Michigan. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=194.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=196.72s)]
*  And then also if some militia members are going to try to capture somebody, that's [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=197.84s)]
*  generally going to be in fact, not to bring it down, but the Oklahoma City bombing was [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=203.36s)]
*  planned at the Amoco truck stop, like six miles from my house. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=209.2s)]
*  Oh, wow. It's amazing, man. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=213.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=214.96s)]
*  And that was in Michigan. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=215.36s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. Right off of US 23. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=216.88s)]
*  It was called the Oasis truck stop. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=218.88s)]
*  And how did they get it to Oklahoma City today? [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=220.72s)]
*  People didn't bid on it, right? [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=222.64000000000001s)]
*  That's crazy. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=223.84s)]
*  Timothy McVeigh, was that his name? [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=226.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=227.52s)]
*  He just was regrouping in Michigan. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=229.28s)]
*  It's a great place to brush up on your militia skills. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=230.96s)]
*  I think he was in there with some of his militia guys. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=233.20000000000002s)]
*  And then they needed a place to plan, maybe some big tables to lay out stuff. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=236.56s)]
*  And the Oasis gas station was turnkey for them. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=240.8s)]
*  Well, that's what's- [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=244.4s)]
*  But I'm watching the news and I'm like, I'm a kid, you know, ish. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=245.12s)]
*  And I'm like, Oasis gas station? [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=248.16000000000003s)]
*  Where like, A, I'm afraid to go in as a kid because there's men sleeping and there's semis. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=250.16000000000003s)]
*  I like when I run in for a candy bar and there's like a parking lot full of men. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=255.04s)]
*  Oh, it's a lot of those places. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=259.28s)]
*  It's a real, I like to call it like a molesters gauntlet kind of that you run through. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=260.88s)]
*  You're like, there's so many pitfalls here. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=266.8s)]
*  So many traps. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=270.32s)]
*  A lot of those truckers will leave the candy right in front of the truck. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=271.68s)]
*  Like just- [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=276.4s)]
*  Sure, a couple of dollar bills right by the steps of the truck. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=276.64s)]
*  A little baggy with just some remnants of some speed. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=280.88s)]
*  Well, you know, I drive a bus. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=285.36s)]
*  I have a tour bus. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=287.04s)]
*  Oh, you do now? [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=288.56s)]
*  Yeah, not because I tour, but because my family and I go out in it for a few weeks every summer. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=289.6s)]
*  Oh yeah? [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=294.88s)]
*  And I go to the sand dunes a lot. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=295.28000000000003s)]
*  So regardless- [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=296.48s)]
*  You go to the sand dunes, you said? [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=297.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=299.12s)]
*  I'm just making sure what you said. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=299.28000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, I've never been to the sand dunes, but- [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=300.40000000000003s)]
*  You know, you know them here in California, Glamis? [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=302.48s)]
*  Nuh-uh. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=305.04s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=305.84000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, it's such an incredibly weird and wonderful place. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=306.8s)]
*  You can't believe it's in California the whole time you're there. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=311.20000000000005s)]
*  It's 400 square miles of sand dunes, 20 by 20. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=314.08000000000004s)]
*  And the folks that are there are like the folks from the Oasis gas station that I grew up with. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=317.76s)]
*  And you're like, wow. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=322.08000000000004s)]
*  But half of them are from Arizona because it's very close to Arizona. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=322.88s)]
*  But it's on the Mexican border with the wall and it's enormous sand dunes. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=325.28000000000003s)]
*  And so, oh, look at this. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=329.84000000000003s)]
*  Oh wow. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=330.88s)]
*  Now you could potentially even see photos of me. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=331.52000000000004s)]
*  Yeah, look at this. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=333.68s)]
*  And so like on New Year's Eve, there'll be 250. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=334.24s)]
*  It's the closest thing in real life to the original Road Warrior. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=336.88s)]
*  Oh, Road Warrior. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=341.84000000000003s)]
*  Specifically Road Warrior. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=342.64s)]
*  And Road Warrior was that movie, it was kind of like Mad Max a little bit. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=344.24s)]
*  It was the second one. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=346.56s)]
*  I think the first Mad Max was black and white and very Australian. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=347.44s)]
*  And then Road Warrior was just, you're in the desert with Mel. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=351.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=356.32s)]
*  In the Last of the V8 Interceptors. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=356.71999999999997s)]
*  Thank you so much. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=358.88s)]
*  I saw Mel Gibson. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=360.32s)]
*  Colin. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=361.59999999999997s)]

*  I think there is. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=674.08s)]
*  I think maybe Berkshire Hathaway bought some conglomerate of really fancy ones. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=675.92s)]
*  That's not what we do. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=682.56s)]
*  There is an app now, Hip Camp, I think it's called. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=684.16s)]
*  It's just like Airbnb where someone might have like eight acres. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=687.12s)]
*  They don't know what to do with the eight acres. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=690.0s)]
*  They're not going to build on it. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=691.68s)]
*  So they just put a 50 amp charger in like a sewer line and some fresh water on that spot. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=693.04s)]
*  And then you book it. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=700.08s)]
*  You never see anyone. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=701.04s)]
*  I just pull the bus into a field on a river, hook up, and then we're good to go. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=702.08s)]
*  Or we'll have, we plan that we're going to be at a friend's house that have big driveways. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=706.8s)]
*  Like that was at my friend's house in Jackson Hole who has a big old driveway. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=711.44s)]
*  So you guys will just hit the bus and just take the- just go all the way up there. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=716.32s)]
*  Yes, but now I'm at the truck stops all the time and then I step out of the bus [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=719.7600000000001s)]
*  and I walk the same way in to go to the professional cashier. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=724.32s)]
*  You know this whole routine. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=729.6s)]
*  And the dudes I'm seeing are all the guys that they're just waking up in there and everything. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=731.36s)]
*  And then I play this game in my head where I'm like, [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=736.64s)]
*  I'm walking tough enough and I got my gloves on. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=740.16s)]
*  Do they think I'm a driver? [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=742.88s)]
*  That's kind of what I want them to think. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=745.28s)]
*  If they see me getting out of the things, I'm like, I don't know if I'm going to try. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=747.6s)]
*  The way I walk into the trucker entrance of the pilot gas station is the performance of my life. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=753.6s)]
*  It beats any work I've ever done in film or television. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=762.24s)]
*  I believe it really does. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=765.28s)]
*  Because I'm afraid of those guys. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=767.68s)]
*  I mean if you really boil down to what it is, it's like I was afraid of them as a kid. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=768.96s)]
*  I'm still afraid of them. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=772.4s)]
*  So I walk into that gas station like you're going to have your hands full. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=773.6s)]
*  Like someone else. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=779.12s)]
*  Even though you're a six foot two. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=780.72s)]
*  But I feel eight years old. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=783.76s)]
*  Dude, it's so funny. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=785.92s)]
*  Sometimes you always feel eight years old, don't you? [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=786.64s)]
*  I'm always, always. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=789.28s)]
*  I have to actively remind myself I'm not. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=790.8s)]
*  It's like a mantra. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=793.68s)]
*  I have to go through a checklist. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=795.76s)]
*  Okay, you're 49. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=797.36s)]
*  You got money. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=799.12s)]
*  You're not tiny. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=800.8s)]
*  You've been in a trillion fights. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=802.32s)]
*  Like what are you fucking afraid of? [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=804.0s)]
*  What is... [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=806.88s)]
*  Did you have step-downs? [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=808.32s)]
*  What did we have? [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=810.08s)]
*  Yeah, we had one guy, Mr. Charlie, and he was in... [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=810.88s)]
*  That says a lot that his name is Mr. Charlie. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=814.4s)]
*  He was in the war. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=816.16s)]
*  And definitely. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=817.28s)]
*  So, and I don't know if he was called Mr. Charlie before the war, [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=818.08s)]
*  but I think he loved the war so much that he changed his name to Charlie. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=820.48s)]
*  You know, like... [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=825.28s)]
*  Which is confusing because was he in Vietnam? [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=826.16s)]
*  He might have been in Vietnam. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=828.4s)]
*  Because they were calling the enemy Charlie. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=829.12s)]
*  Yeah, I think he... [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=831.36s)]
*  He took on the enemies. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=833.28s)]
*  That's extra dark. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=835.04s)]
*  He would take my mom always to like the Chinese restaurant all the time, [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=835.92s)]
*  and he would kind of like do like a lot of... [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=838.96s)]
*  He would like kind of pay homage in there. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=842.24s)]
*  He did some kind of bizarre shit and sometimes he would take us. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=843.84s)]
*  This is one crazy thing he would do. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=847.4399999999999s)]
*  He owned a car wash that had like all the... [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=849.04s)]
*  Coin operated. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=850.8s)]
*  Yeah, coin operated, dude. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=852.0s)]
*  So he always had... [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=853.2s)]
*  I've heard those are cash cows. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=853.68s)]
*  He always had some fucking money on him. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=855.3599999999999s)]
*  My whole life, the one thing I wanted to own was a coin operated car wash. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=857.76s)]
*  Yes. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=861.12s)]
*  You grew up hearing that it's just like... [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=861.92s)]
*  It just prints money. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=863.52s)]
*  It just sits there. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=864.88s)]
*  No one works there. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=866.16s)]
*  You stop in occasionally and grab a couple thousand dollars in quarters. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=867.68s)]
*  You stop in, do CPR on somebody. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=871.28s)]
*  Pull a body out of the 55 gallon drum trash can. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=875.28s)]
*  Yeah, my mom would always take us to wash her car. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=878.4799999999999s)]
*  That was like a big thing that we would do. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=880.88s)]
*  Anyway, so she met Mr. Charlie and then he would take us to [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=883.1999999999999s)]
*  Holiday Inn Express sometimes for the continental breakfast. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=887.84s)]
*  But he would say he was taking us out to eat, right? [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=891.76s)]
*  But it was just... [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=893.76s)]
*  It was just the free breakfast. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=894.64s)]
*  We would just go in the door and eat, right? [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=895.68s)]
*  But I never knew so I'd always like ask the strangers to like... [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=898.0799999999999s)]
*  If I could order like a fucking something. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=901.28s)]
*  Like, yeah, I'll have another waffle and the people would just be like, [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=904.3199999999999s)]
*  What the fuck are you talking about? [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=906.72s)]
*  I'm here for my son's soccer tournament. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=907.92s)]
*  You thought everyone worked there. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=909.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=911.12s)]
*  But he was good and then he lost his mind or something and he had Alzheimer's. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=912.64s)]
*  And then he wore gloves a lot and it was kind of like people always ask him. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=917.28s)]
*  He played the piano and he couldn't hear him. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=921.52s)]
*  And it was just like a lot of just... [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=923.1999999999999s)]
*  It kind of just devolved, you know? [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=925.28s)]
*  What age was... [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=926.72s)]
*  He might have died at 89. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=928.4s)]
*  Okay, wow. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=931.12s)]
*  He's much older than I was. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=931.84s)]
*  Yeah, he's much older. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=933.76s)]
*  But your mom has a flair for older men. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=935.12s)]
*  Okay, but back up. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=938.24s)]
*  How old were you while Mr. Charlie was taking you to the Holiday Inn Express? [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=939.36s)]
*  I was probably a good 11, I bet. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=943.6s)]
*  And was he... [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=946.96s)]
*  He was too old to come in and be like, [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=947.6800000000001s)]
*  I got a new program and I'm the dad. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=950.48s)]
*  Or did he do that? [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=952.88s)]
*  No, he didn't really. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=953.52s)]
*  He was pretty chill. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=954.72s)]
*  He wanted you to reach for the remote for him and stuff. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=956.24s)]
*  Yeah, he wore like a cool hat and he would just... [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=958.48s)]
*  Sometimes he would get his dog in his lap and just... [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=960.8000000000001s)]
*  He would tell us how much he loved his dog [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=963.12s)]
*  and he would make us kind of sit there and listen to him tell us that. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=964.8000000000001s)]
*  But he was a pretty handsome guy. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=966.96s)]
*  And what else? [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=970.96s)]
*  How old was your mom while he was 89? [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=972.88s)]
*  She was probably 70, I bet. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=975.44s)]
*  I think he was probably 20 years older than my mom. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=979.52s)]
*  And your dad, how much older? [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=982.4000000000001s)]
*  38 years old. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=984.32s)]
*  My parents were 38 different. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=985.12s)]
*  Why were you emancipated at 14? [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=988.08s)]
*  I just didn't like being at home, man. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=992.8000000000001s)]
*  I fucking hated it. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=995.0400000000001s)]
*  I didn't like my environment that much. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=997.0400000000001s)]
*  I just didn't like it. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=999.76s)]
*  I didn't like my environment. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=1000.88s)]
*  I didn't like not having a say in where I was or who I was. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=1003.12s)]
*  I felt like I kind of just got in this space in life [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=1008.08s)]
*  that I was like, this doesn't make any sense. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=1011.36s)]
*  This family, there's no connection. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=1014.32s)]
*  My family felt like a business that you had to work at, [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=1017.2800000000001s)]
*  but you didn't know what the job was. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=1019.44s)]
*  But you had to be there every day. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=1021.2s)]
*  Every day you were standing around. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=1022.96s)]
*  There was like a kitchen. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=1024.88s)]
*  But you have no idea what the business is, [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=1027.0400000000002s)]
*  but you got to be there. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=1029.1200000000001s)]

*  I love the snickerdoodle, but these were more- [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=1113.76s)]
*  Can I guess, were they an oatmeal raisin? [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=1117.2s)]
*  They had something like that. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=1120.0800000000002s)]
*  Cinnamon oatmeal raisin. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=1120.88s)]

*  plastic inside of the box and then there was, they were all lined up. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=1124.8s)]
*  They fit exactly as many as they could in that box. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=1128.56s)]
*  And it was an unbelievable amount of cookies to be around as a child. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=1131.04s)]
*  We couldn't even fathom it, but so that was, yeah, that was the kind of work [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=1135.1200000000001s)]
*  mom did. She was just always gone a lot. [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=1141.04s)]

*  Two little sisters? [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=1143.44s)]
*  Yeah. Well, I have two sisters and a brother. [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=1144.72s)]
*  But the brother's way older, right? Like could have been your- [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=1147.36s)]
*  No, my dad had some children from his first marriage that were like way older. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=1150.08s)]
*  Like one of them was like 57 when I was like probably eight. [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=1155.6s)]
*  Right. [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=1158.96s)]
*  And he- [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=1159.6s)]
*  So you guys didn't probably- [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=1160.08s)]
*  I think somebody shot him, but- [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=1161.12s)]
*  How old's your older brother from your mom? [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=1165.2s)]
*  My older brother from my mom is two years older than me. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=1167.36s)]

*  Yeah. He's awesome. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=1170.08s)]
*  Do you have a little brother syndrome like I do? [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=1170.88s)]
*  Like what is it? [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=1174.16s)]
*  Well, like A, I thought I was terrible at everything. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=1176.64s)]
*  My brother's five years older than me. [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=1178.72s)]

*  Little brother syndrome. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=1186.16s)]
*  Oh, I wonder if I agree with what the definition on Google is. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=1187.5200000000002s)]
*  The little brother syndrome can manifest in one of two ways. [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=1189.7600000000002s)]
*  A, a sense of entitlement. [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=1192.48s)]
*  I deserve what he has or two, a means for advancement. [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=1194.64s)]
*  He can do it. I can do it too. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=1197.8400000000001s)]
*  I didn't even know of this definition. [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=1199.2s)]
*  And I guess I agree with some of the items in there, [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=1200.88s)]
*  but in general for me, I wanted to be cool and older [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=1203.6000000000001s)]
*  and I wanted him to let me hang out with him. [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=1208.24s)]
*  And I was trying desperately to like accomplish [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=1210.4s)]
*  all these weird tasks I had decided was the entrance [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=1213.2s)]
*  into being his best friend and probably like an inferiority complex. [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=1217.2s)]
*  And then I got, when I got around kids my age, [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=1222.4s)]
*  I was like, oh wait, I'm kind of strong. [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=1225.52s)]
*  I'm not as terrible at that. [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=1228.0s)]
*  And then I was like high on that. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=1229.6000000000001s)]
*  But yeah, I just, I guess wanting to be around somebody nonstop [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=1232.48s)]
*  who was very ambivalent about me being around. [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=1239.52s)]
*  Your brother? [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=1242.0800000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=1242.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=1243.1200000000001s)]

*  Five years is a long enough stretch where it's like, yeah, [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=1245.52s)]
*  if some kid is following me around and that kid is, [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=1247.44s)]
*  he's going to be weird no matter what because he's younger. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=1250.24s)]
*  And I was weird on top of it. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=1252.5600000000002s)]
*  And you're fucking weird. [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=1254.88s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=1256.0800000000002s)]

*  which is I only hung out with kids on welfare [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=1717.52s)]
*  who also had divorced parents who also probably had violence in the household. [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=1721.8400000000001s)]
*  I like being around people that I don't think are going to judge me. [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=1727.76s)]
*  And in the program, everyone there is a fucking scumbag. [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=1731.8400000000001s)]
*  Everyone's a piece of shit. [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=1734.96s)]
*  That's why we're there. [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=1736.16s)]
*  And like the great experience you have if you go to AA and you work the steps [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=1737.4399999999998s)]
*  is you're like you've made this list of things you've done wrong [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=1744.32s)]
*  and you're required to tell somebody and generally it's your sponsor or whatever. [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=1747.28s)]
*  And you're certain when you walk in there and you let them have this list of things you regret [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=1752.9599999999998s)]
*  that they're going to call the police on you or throw up in disgust with you. [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=1757.36s)]
*  And they look at you, they're almost laughing. [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=1762.4799999999998s)]
*  Well, that's it. [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=1766.0s)]
*  Well, you didn't fuck any animals. [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=1767.36s)]
*  That's like I'm impressed you haven't fucked the animals. [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=1768.8s)]
*  And then you're like, well, read the back of that. [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=1771.4399999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=1772.7199999999998s)]
*  Oh shit, you're right. [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=1773.52s)]
*  I'm fucking love something now. [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=1774.3999999999999s)]
*  But that look of like, yeah, me too is the most comforting thing for me. [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=1777.1999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, there'll be times when I'm in a meeting [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=1785.36s)]
*  and like you're sitting there and somebody says something and you can feel this is crazy. [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=1787.6799999999998s)]
*  It's almost like how volleyball teams all get their period at the same time. [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=1794.1599999999999s)]
*  You can feel like everybody in the room at the same time. [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=1798.1599999999999s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=1804.1599999999999s)]
*  You ever had that happen? [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=1805.12s)]
*  Oh yeah, for sure. [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=1806.0s)]
*  And you're like, it's almost like a group of fish or something like some of the steam. [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=1806.8799999999999s)]
*  All change direction. [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=1812.0s)]
*  Some of the steam leaves at the same time out of every it's got to be some physiological thing, [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=1813.84s)]
*  but it's unbelievable. [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=1820.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=1821.84s)]
*  Well, weirdly, I just interviewed this expert and his book was called Super Communicators. [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=1822.56s)]
*  And he was talking about them. [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=1827.52s)]
*  On arm care? [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=1829.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=1830.1599999999999s)]
*  When two people are having a conversation and it's the same conversation. [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=1831.6799999999998s)]
*  Oh yeah, Charles Duhigg. [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=1837.28s)]
*  Fuck, they're fast. [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=1839.76s)]
*  It's almost too much now. [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=1840.48s)]
*  It's too fast and I feel like I'm having deja vu. [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=1842.32s)]
*  It's a triggering day. [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=1846.08s)]
*  No, no, keep it up. [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=1847.12s)]
*  Keep it up. [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=1847.9199999999998s)]
*  Don't dial them down. [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=1848.32s)]
*  You guys have a winning recipe. [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=1849.52s)]
*  But there's basically like three different conversations. [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=1851.28s)]
*  All conversations fall into three categories. [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=1856.0800000000002s)]
*  There's like there's logistical ones, like what are we supposed to do next? [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=1858.16s)]
*  And then there's emotional ones. [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=1861.52s)]
*  What are you talking about for what? [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=1862.8s)]
*  So like a classic one would be you and your girlfriend are talking and you think you're [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=1864.16s)]
*  having a conversation like how should we fix this problem? [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=1871.92s)]
*  And she's having an emotional conversation. [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=1876.96s)]
*  She's saying I'm overwhelmed by this whole thing. [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=1880.08s)]
*  Got it. [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=1882.8s)]
*  And then so and you can look at a brain in an fMRI and see like the part of her brain [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=1883.28s)]
*  that's active is like the amygdala and the part of your brain that's active is the neocortex. [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=1888.56s)]
*  So literally you can't have the same conversation. [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=1893.04s)]
*  It's like two different parts of the brain that do two different things. [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=1896.8s)]
*  So you're like well here's how we're going to fix this, hon. [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=1899.6799999999998s)]
*  You're never going to do that again. [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=1902.08s)]
*  I'm going to tell it, right? [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=1903.28s)]
*  And she's like nothing is comforting her fear in that moment. [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=1904.24s)]
*  So you guys are just like and then the more you talk having the two different conversations, [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=1907.6s)]
*  the worse it gets for each other. [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=1912.1599999999999s)]
*  So when you both are having the exact the real same conversation and you look at people's [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=1914.08s)]
*  brains in an fMRI, all of a sudden their brains become kind of indistinguishable from one [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=1919.84s)]
*  another. [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=1924.7199999999998s)]
*  Or another example is you can take a musician playing by themselves and then another musician [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=1925.1999999999998s)]
*  playing by themselves look at their brain in an fMRI and they have a unique pattern. [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=1931.36s)]
*  And once they start playing together or start doing a duet, their brain pattern become [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=1935.52s)]
*  indistinguishable. [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=1941.2s)]
*  So we will match our breathing when we're connected. [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=1942.0s)]
*  Our heart rates will match. [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=1946.56s)]
*  All this crazy shit will start mirroring. [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=1948.08s)]
*  Yeah, this is like scientifically proven time and time again. [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=1950.56s)]
*  So yes, that moment in a meeting, it's like it's chaotic. [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=1954.8s)]
*  Someone fought over a parking spot. [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=1958.0s)]
*  Another guy just got broken up with blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=1959.6s)]
*  This person sledgehammers through, generally for me when I've experienced it, with some [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=1962.24s)]
*  moment of vulnerability. [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=1969.04s)]
*  I just failed at this fucking thing and we all go like, wait, oh god, I know exactly [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=1970.72s)]
*  what it feels like to fail in that specific way. [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=1976.56s)]
*  And now all of us have joined the same brain pattern. [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=1980.08s)]
*  So I think it's not like it's not imagined. [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=1984.64s)]
*  I think it's physiologically observable. [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=1986.56s)]
*  And it's so powerful. [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=1990.16s)]
*  It's when you realize like, oh yeah, we're social monkeys and we're supposed to be in [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=1992.64s)]
*  a group like this and we're supposed to be dialed in and it feels fucking right. [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=1996.8s)]
*  And then I didn't go to church or I was drugged to church. [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=2001.28s)]
*  That was never a part of my life. [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=2004.48s)]
*  So I don't have that kind of nostalgia for that collective experience I know people in [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=2006.72s)]
*  church have. [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=2012.72s)]
*  My grandparents would take me and my brother and I would get in trouble. [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=2014.0s)]
*  My papa Bob would flick our ears and we missed it. [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=2016.4s)]
*  That's a great comparison like when you said like with the birds, like how they all change [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=2021.6000000000001s)]
*  at the same time. [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=2024.5600000000002s)]
*  It's so crazy. [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=2026.0800000000002s)]
*  Yeah, I think there's a lot of other things going on that we just don't have the ability [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=2027.0400000000002s)]
*  since we only have five senses. [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=2030.0s)]
*  It's hard for us to I think there's a ton of stuff and information that's in the world, [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=2031.3600000000001s)]
*  but we only have five ways of inputting it. [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=2036.88s)]
*  So we really are kind of limited as opposed to maybe other things may have more, you know, [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=2040.48s)]
*  or in the future they may have like creatures that have more or something, you know. [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=2045.44s)]
*  Are you would you consider yourself hypervigilant? [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=2049.84s)]
*  I don't do you mean like, well, I like the Capitol or something like that. [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=2055.04s)]
*  Like what are you talking about? [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=2059.44s)]
*  People that invaded the cap? [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=2060.56s)]
*  No, no, no, no. [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=2061.52s)]
*  Like I'm guessing I don't know enough about you. [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=2063.36s)]
*  I don't know if you leave the house at 14. [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=2065.28s)]
*  My guess is it wasn't like the Cleavers. [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=2069.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=2072.4s)]
*  Right. [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=2072.88s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=2073.28s)]
*  I just didn't feel any connection at home. [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=2073.92s)]
*  So then at a certain point I was like, well, why am I going to stay here and let this define me? [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=2075.52s)]
*  Where did you go at 14? [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=2079.12s)]
*  I don't want to stay with a friend. [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=2080.48s)]
*  Oh, you did? [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=2081.76s)]
*  Yep. [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=2082.2400000000002s)]
*  One of my buddies and their parents were fine. [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=2082.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=2084.7200000000003s)]
*  Their parents were pretty cool and we had a nice time and we're still, [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=2084.88s)]
*  I still go over there when I go home. [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=2087.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=2090.08s)]
*  So it's like, and their kids, their kids left like a year later and I was still. [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=2090.56s)]
*  You stayed after they left? [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=2094.16s)]
*  Forever. [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=2095.84s)]
*  Wait, so your buddy was a couple of years older than you? [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=2096.4s)]
*  He was same age, but he, yeah, something happened. [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=2098.8s)]
*  He drove into the neighbor's house or something. [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=2101.04s)]
*  He was drinking and then he had to leave and so I was still there. [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=2102.64s)]
*  You were still there. [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=2106.4s)]
*  They kicked out. [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=2107.12s)]
*  Oh, and now I'm in his room. [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=2107.44s)]

*  There wasn't a phone in there, but it was easy to have privacy there. [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=2417.6s)]
*  And it was a landline. [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=2420.32s)]
*  My dad was out. [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=2421.2s)]
*  He wasn't sober yet. [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=2422.48s)]
*  So really he was partying. [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=2423.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=2424.72s)]
*  Oh, he was going fucking hard. [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=2424.96s)]
*  Sold cars, drove a Corvette, fucking bang coke at the bar. [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=2426.64s)]
*  Seven days is a weird. [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=2431.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=2433.2s)]
*  He was, he was everything. [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=2433.6s)]
*  Dude, that's so cool, man. [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=2435.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=2437.2799999999997s)]
*  I remember that. [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=2437.52s)]
*  And that changed my life. [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=2438.4s)]
*  Oh, that changes everything. [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=2439.52s)]
*  And I liked it so fucking much. [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=2440.64s)]
*  And I remember she like, she was in eighth grade and I was in sixth grade. [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=2443.68s)]
*  So we would make out at the bus before she got on the bus. [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=2447.7599999999998s)]
*  I'd go to the basketball games with her and she told me to go up her shirt. [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=2450.72s)]
*  She's like, go on my shirt. [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=2454.0s)]
*  And I remember going up her shirt and I was like, her bra felt so tight. [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=2455.4399999999996s)]
*  And I was like, she's like, I'm supposed to go under this bra, I think. [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=2458.08s)]
*  But fuck it's so tight. [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=2461.04s)]
*  It's going to hurt if I, and I was like, monkeying around in there and fumbling. [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=2462.0s)]
*  And then she's like, just go on around. [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=2465.68s)]
*  Like she really made me do it. [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=2466.8799999999997s)]
*  She was really assertive. [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=2468.48s)]
*  And I got up in there and got it. [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=2469.04s)]
*  And it was euphoric. [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=2471.12s)]
*  And it was such a high. [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=2473.7599999999998s)]
*  Such a high. [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=2475.12s)]
*  And I didn't have it. [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=2475.4399999999996s)]
*  And maybe this little brother, I just felt like, A, I could never [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=2476.9599999999996s)]
*  turn down that attention if I got it. [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=2480.64s)]
*  I couldn't resist it. [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=2483.7599999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=2484.96s)]
*  And of course I'm like, and they don't know. [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=2485.44s)]
*  No one knows. [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=2488.4s)]
*  Everything's fine. [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=2489.2s)]
*  I'm still very nice to this person. [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=2490.16s)]
*  And that thing happened. [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=2492.0s)]
*  And then, yeah, just a terrible pattern of cheating. [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=2493.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=2496.48s)]
*  The bad pattern starts, man. [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=2496.88s)]
*  And yeah, I was saying when I think back now, I've cleared up like, dude, I quit [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=2498.64s)]
*  drinking in 2004, in September of 2004. [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=2502.72s)]
*  I had an opiate relapse. [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=2506.16s)]
*  But in general, I haven't had like fucking wreckage in 19 years. [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=2507.68s)]
*  Oh, that's great. [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=2512.72s)]
*  And so the stuff that really plagues me now is like just really going back and being [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=2513.8399999999997s)]
*  like, God, yeah, those girls didn't deserve, like they deserved me to be faithful. [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=2519.8399999999997s)]
*  To be like, yeah, shit works. [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=2525.12s)]
*  I did not use them to prop up my own self-esteem and then need someone again to, [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=2526.24s)]
*  because it doesn't last. [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=2533.2799999999997s)]
*  And yeah, yeah, feeling great. [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=2534.16s)]
*  I remember walking across a gym. [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=2536.0s)]
*  I was at this new school. [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=2538.08s)]
*  I walk across the gym and some girl, this girl was hot, dude. [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=2540.24s)]
*  She was like, I think she had like 30 tits. [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=2544.16s)]
*  She was so hot. [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=2548.56s)]
*  And she was looking at me. [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=2550.0s)]
*  And I thought I had like shit on my leg or something. [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=2552.32s)]
*  And I was literally like so fucking embarrassed. [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=2556.48s)]
*  And I was walking across the gym. [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=2559.28s)]
*  I could feel every step. [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=2560.48s)]
*  And I was like, I've got to get across this gym. [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=2561.68s)]
*  And I got to find a mirror ASAP. [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=2564.16s)]
*  And I got to see shit myself because these bitches are catching on. [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=2565.8399999999997s)]
*  And then after that, like a girl like came to the office one time and kind of liked me. [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=2572.72s)]
*  But before that, I'd been so nervous. [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=2577.04s)]
*  Like one girl I liked in like middle school. [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=2578.64s)]
*  I didn't know how to tell her this. [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=2582.16s)]
*  I saved up the saliva in my mouth the whole class. [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=2584.48s)]
*  And after class, I ran up behind her and spit right in the back of her hair. [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=2588.8799999999997s)]
*  That was your move. [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=2594.16s)]
*  It was like an animal. [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=2596.72s)]
*  It was like literally like a chimpanzee. [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=2597.92s)]
*  When I think about it now, it's like, dude, you were an and you had no genesequal. [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=2600.0s)]
*  You didn't you were you fuck. [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=2606.64s)]
*  And I said you just shit in the hallway and stare at her as you did. [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=2608.48s)]
*  But when I say you, yeah, when I think about the effect over here, I love you. [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=2613.3599999999997s)]
*  I love you so much. [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=2620.08s)]

*  I'm shit in the hallway for you. [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=2622.32s)]
*  I'm ruining myself for you. [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=2625.2000000000003s)]
*  I'm fully exposed. [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=2626.96s)]
*  Yeah, it was like it was just such an effect that that kind of thing had such an effect. [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=2629.2000000000003s)]
*  And that became like an addiction, man. [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=2634.96s)]
*  Like just in the sense of wanting attention from women, [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=2638.0s)]
*  it wasn't as much like a sexual addiction for me. [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=2641.1200000000003s)]
*  Like over the years, it just was like I needed to know if that there was any chance that that girl cared about me. [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=2643.6800000000003s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=2650.48s)]
*  I just needed you craved it. [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=2651.04s)]
*  Yeah, I needed her to look at me. [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=2652.56s)]

*  Yeah. [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=2659.04s)]
*  And then it's OK if it played out how it wanted, but I needed to at least have her. [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=2660.64s)]
*  Not be invisible. [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=2664.88s)]
*  Yes. [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=2666.0s)]

*  Yeah. [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=2681.84s)]
*  I had I had a great relationship with my mom, but it kept getting punctuated by stepdads. [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=2683.6s)]
*  Oh, really? [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=2689.92s)]

*  The sizzler of stepdads. [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=2700.48s)]
*  But so it'd be like super connected and it'd just be the four of us. [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=2703.28s)]
*  My little sister, my brother and my mom, and that was always perfect. [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=2708.64s)]
*  But then a new guy would roll in and then it was like his program. [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=2712.0s)]
*  And we had to have different manners at the table and she'd be distracted. [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=2715.12s)]
*  Understandably, she's like in her 20s raising three kids by herself. [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=2719.2799999999997s)]

*  And what age? [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=2781.7599999999998s)]
*  I think this was in college and she and I, she broke up. [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=2783.2799999999997s)]
*  She'd had it. [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=2787.36s)]
*  And I remember saying, you can't break up with me. [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=2788.64s)]
*  You're my mom. [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=2791.2s)]

*  It came out of my fucking face. [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=2792.88s)]
*  And that's just a slight improvement over spitting in her hair. [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=2795.2799999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=2798.08s)]
*  That's where you had matured to by the time you're in college. [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=2798.56s)]
*  You can't. [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=2802.96s)]

*  Yeah. [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=2804.48s)]
*  What a Freudian slip. [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=2804.72s)]
*  Freudian water slide, dude. [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=2806.72s)]
*  But it blew. [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=2808.72s)]
*  It came out. [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=2809.44s)]
*  It like came out. [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=2810.16s)]
*  It just, I was like, you can't break up with me. [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=2811.12s)]
*  You're my mom. [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=2814.16s)]
*  Oh, my Lord. [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=2815.04s)]
*  And I was like, and I didn't know for years what that even meant. [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=2815.68s)]
*  And then once I got into recovery and started getting a look at my life, [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=2818.32s)]
*  I was able to be like, wow, dude, like. [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=2821.36s)]
*  I had no understanding of like how to get affection or be fair with affection [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=2824.56s)]
*  or anything like that. [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=2830.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=2831.84s)]
*  I mean, I didn't have a template. [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=2832.32s)]
*  I didn't have a fucking idea. [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=2833.7599999999998s)]
*  I didn't know. [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=2835.04s)]
*  What was her response? [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=2835.6s)]
*  Do you remember? [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=2836.7999999999997s)]
*  I know she felt probably bad for me. [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=2838.4s)]
*  Oh, good. [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=2840.64s)]
*  She loved me for sure. [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=2841.36s)]
*  And she's a super loving girl. [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=2843.04s)]
*  But I think she probably years later probably saw like, oh, that dude was not safe. [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=2844.4s)]
*  Yeah, that guy was not ready. [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=2851.7599999999998s)]
*  He's not ready for him. [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=2853.6s)]
*  And he's still fucking just trying to get ready. [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=2854.64s)]
*  He's trying to get ready. [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=2858.4s)]
*  But that stuff doesn't go away, man. [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=2859.6s)]
*  That's the crazy thing. [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=2861.04s)]
*  I thought at certain like, like at certain times in my life, I'll be like, oh, in a couple [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=2861.92s)]
*  years, this will be gone. [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=2865.68s)]
*  But it doesn't go away unless you do something about it. [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=2866.72s)]
*  Yeah, you have. [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=2869.52s)]
*  I have the fantasy that to be aware of it would solve it. [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=2870.24s)]
*  Oh, I see what's happening. [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=2873.92s)]
*  I'm just trying to get, you know, I'm trying to heal. [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=2875.2799999999997s)]
*  Oh, God, I could go super deep, which is like. [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=2880.4s)]
*  And this is recent and this is probably too much for your show or the dudes who listen [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=2883.2799999999997s)]
*  to this. [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=2886.64s)]
*  But no, we've dude, if I crown you one more time, I'm literally turning into the Garth [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=2887.12s)]
*  Brooks. [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=2891.2799999999997s)]
*  Oh, yeah, me too. [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=2891.6s)]
*  I've been crying all the time. [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=2892.96s)]
*  That's why I get bad. [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=2893.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=2894.48s)]
*  I didn't cry for 30 years and now I can't make it through the day without crying, bro. [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=2895.44s)]
*  It's like it's fucking being sober. [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=2898.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=2901.36s)]
*  It's like you got the menace. [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=2901.84s)]
*  You don't have anything to numb it. [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=2903.2s)]
*  And here it is. [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=2904.32s)]
*  But I also think like there was a sexual component, which is like, OK, so my mom adores me. [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=2905.6s)]
*  That's obvious. [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=2911.7599999999998s)]
*  I was the golden child. [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=2913.2799999999997s)]
*  I did not lack for a mom who believed in me or supported me or thought I was wonderful. [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=2915.12s)]
*  She definitely did. [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=2919.36s)]
*  But something would take her away from me. [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=2921.2s)]
*  And I was smart enough to realize, oh, we can't fulfill this romantic desire of hers. [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=2924.4s)]
*  Like that's something we can't fulfill. [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=2930.72s)]
*  She's going to have to go get boyfriends. [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=2933.36s)]
*  Right. [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=2935.12s)]
*  Aka she's going to have to have a sexual relationship with people. [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=2935.7599999999998s)]
*  Right. [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=2939.2799999999997s)]
*  So I think in some weird way, and I think I'm just starting to understand this aspect, [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=2939.92s)]
*  which is like I have to give that to any woman if I want her to stay around in a way that is [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=2945.2000000000003s)]
*  world class and you can't go you don't want to go shopping for more. [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=2953.84s)]
*  Like the priority I put on that part, the sexual part, I think was very [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=2957.36s)]
*  outsized for what a woman would even give a shit about. [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=2962.48s)]
*  Oh, so you thought kid I was like, oh, the only thing I don't have [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=2965.76s)]
*  that my mom needs is sexual part. [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=2969.92s)]
*  So I need that's what I want her to stay at all times. [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=2972.6400000000003s)]
*  And I don't want any of these guys to come around. [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=2975.6000000000004s)]
*  So if I now if I'm having this experience that also feels loving and nurturing [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=2977.2000000000003s)]
*  with a female, my thought is like I have to give her that thing [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=2981.6800000000003s)]
*  in a way that she'll never go need it and leave me for it. [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=2986.0s)]
*  God, that sounds like that sounds kind of exhausting in a way. [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=2989.44s)]
*  I mean, kudos to you, dude. [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=2992.96s)]
*  Yeah, I don't know. [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=2995.0400000000004s)]
*  I was never out. [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=2995.76s)]
*  I was like I was always so nervous with sex. [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=2996.5600000000004s)]
*  It would be like, oh, shit, you know, and it would be like, yeah, oh, dude, so like [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=3000.0s)]
*  unbelievable. [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=3006.2400000000002s)]
*  And I would just yell things out like that. [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=3007.6800000000003s)]
*  That was great sex. [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=3009.6000000000004s)]
*  You know, just hoping that you could rewrite history for her. [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=3010.96s)]
*  And it's just, oh, no, nobody has had nobody has given out more bad sex. [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=3014.88s)]
*  I don't think. [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=3024.16s)]
*  And me hands down, there should be a game show, I think. [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=3025.28s)]
*  And they just put like a woop bracelet on you. [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=3029.92s)]
*  And it's just like people are like, no fucking way. [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=3032.0s)]
*  Oh, my goodness. [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=3034.88s)]
*  Well, we haven't seen one this well. [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=3035.6800000000003s)]
*  This is unbelievable. [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=3037.12s)]
*  This is an underwire. [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=3038.16s)]
*  Do you remember when they asked George Zimmerman's personal trainer on The Witness, [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=3039.12s)]
*  Dan, when he would write rank his physical fitness level out of 10? [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=3044.0s)]
*  And George Zimmerman was the guy that shot the Trayvon Martin. [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=3048.4s)]
*  And his his he had a physical trainer, which is comical in itself. [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=3051.92s)]
*  But they asked the trainer, like, what would you rank? [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=3055.76s)]
*  What would you give Zimmerman's physical fitness out of 10? [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=3058.4s)]
*  And he said with a straight face. [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=3062.8s)]
*  Point A. [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=3065.28s)]
*  Or some point, you know, I was like, oh, my Lord, that is the last thing you want to hear [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=3067.2000000000003s)]
*  your fucking trainer get into the decimals when trying to assess you. [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=3074.16s)]
*  Why don't you say? [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=3079.6800000000003s)]
*  I guess he thought if he said zero, it would be, oh, do we have it? [[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=3081.36s)]
*  Oh, point five out of 10. [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=3085.52s)]
*  Oh, my God. [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=3088.88s)]
*  Is that wow. [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=3090.08s)]
*  Oh, whoo. [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=3091.12s)]
*  What he really said was zero. [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=3094.0s)]
*  That was him. [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=3096.08s)]
*  Like he's like, I got to throw a half point in to just not be so cruel. [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=3096.7200000000003s)]
*  Yeah, we got to know. [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=3101.6800000000003s)]
*  He's sitting there. [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=3102.56s)]
*  Presumably he's like in that behind that desk waiting, hoping to see her. [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=3103.44s)]
*  I hope he gives me a four, maybe at a high end and low end of expectation. [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=3108.64s)]
*  That would be more shocking than the verdict. [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=3114.24s)]
*  I was like, yes, I'm going to take away one of the two things. [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=3116.8799999999997s)]
*  Dude, yeah. [[00:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=3123.12s)]
*  And you don't want to be that little flubber in prison. [[00:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=3123.6s)]
*  I don't think because those are the guys I hear that get like [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=3126.08s)]
*  kind of banged a lot around like the holidays and stuff. [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=3129.04s)]
*  Why the holidays? [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=3135.12s)]
*  Just be sentimental. [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=3136.08s)]
*  Yeah, just like the little chubby guys in prison get fucked around the holidays. [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=3137.36s)]

*  Yeah, I was with I've had three really long term relationships. [[00:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=3259.76s)]
*  I had like a five year in that started in high school and then lasted to me living in [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=3264.72s)]
*  LA. [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=3270.8s)]
*  And then I was with an incredible woman, Brie, for nine years. [[00:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=3271.6s)]
*  But that one I thought I had kind of outsmarted, which was I had already felt so fucking terrible [[00:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=3276.96s)]
*  about cheating on girls. [[00:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=3284.56s)]
*  I always got caught. [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=3286.0s)]
*  Inevitably, I got caught. [[00:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=3287.2s)]
*  And those were the I can remember those phone calls trying to explain why it didn't you [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=3288.56s)]
*  didn't care. [[00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=3294.7999999999997s)]
*  Was there anything worse than that? [[00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=3297.04s)]
*  Oh, my God. [[00:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=3298.3199999999997s)]
*  Well, it's tied with driving to someone's apartment to tell them that you're breaking [[00:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=3299.28s)]
*  up. [[00:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=3305.36s)]
*  I mean, those those two for me are like I've had a lot of motorcycle injuries. [[00:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=3305.6000000000004s)]
*  I take them a million times before I'd ever drive to someone's apartment and just say [[00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=3310.5600000000004s)]
*  like, I think we're in different places. [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=3315.1200000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=3317.6000000000004s)]
*  And they're like, no shit. [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=3317.76s)]
*  Oh, dude, the craziest is when you go over there and you knock on the door and they open [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=3320.8s)]
*  it, but they kind of walk away from the door after they go. [[00:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=3324.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=3326.88s)]
*  So it's just fully up for you to walk in and talk to you. [[00:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=3327.36s)]
*  You know, it's like when the gig is up, dude. [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=3330.08s)]
*  Oh, fuck. [[00:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=3332.96s)]
*  I hate it so much. [[00:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=3333.92s)]
*  And then, you know, you've been feeling that way for months in my case before you have [[00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=3334.7200000000003s)]
*  the balls to drive over and fucking be honest. [[00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=3339.6800000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=3343.04s)]
*  And then so that drive isn't is insufferable. [[00:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=3343.76s)]
*  And then sitting in there is so terrible. [[00:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=3346.48s)]
*  But there is that feeling when you walk out the door and you've made it and you're walking [[00:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=3349.6s)]
*  to your car. [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=3354.2400000000002s)]
*  We're just going, oh, oh, thank you. [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=3354.96s)]
*  Okay. [[00:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=3357.76s)]
*  Oh, you do get that blast of like relief. [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=3358.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=3361.76s)]
*  And then a day later, you're like, I think I'm in love with her. [[00:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=3362.5600000000004s)]
*  I think I love her so much and I fucked up. [[00:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=3365.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=3368.4s)]
*  I think I really fucked up. [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=3368.88s)]
*  Then you're insanely in love with her for a few days and then you got to like white [[00:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=3370.48s)]
*  knuckle that just like it's booze or coke to not reengage. [[00:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=3373.92s)]
*  Anywho, what were we? [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=3378.4s)]
*  Oh, so when Bree and I met, we met cheating on two people. [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=3380.32s)]
*  Oh, okay. [[00:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=3386.2400000000002s)]
*  Right. [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=3387.28s)]
*  And I knew immediately I'm like, I fucking love this girl. [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=3388.48s)]
*  Like, oh my God, do I love this girl? [[00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=3392.4s)]
*  Like, I want to have kids with this girl at some point. [[00:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=3393.84s)]
*  Wow. [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=3396.96s)]
*  And had you ever felt like that before or no? [[00:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=3397.2000000000003s)]
*  I guess I did. [[00:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=3402.0s)]
*  The girl I was cheating on with that I'd been with for five years, certainly. [[00:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=3403.6800000000003s)]
*  But that had run its course in that like I had moved to LA to pursue this. [[00:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=3407.0400000000004s)]
*  She was she hadn't joined me. [[00:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=3411.2000000000003s)]
*  It was kind of obvious. [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=3413.0400000000004s)]
*  We also got kind of we got realistic about the fact that we only see each other four [[00:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=3414.7999999999997s)]
*  times a year. [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=3419.3599999999997s)]
*  And like that got a little it approached an open relationship or maybe even became one. [[00:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=3420.0s)]
*  It kind of was just like, look, you're a human. [[00:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=3425.3599999999997s)]
*  I'm a human. [[00:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=3427.2s)]
*  I'm 21. [[00:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=3427.8399999999997s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=3429.3599999999997s)]
*  You know, as children. [[00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=3429.8399999999997s)]
*  So we were kind of grown up about that. [[00:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=3430.72s)]
*  So then when I met Bree and we met cheating, I just had this moment of honesty with her [[00:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=3432.24s)]
*  or I said like, I would like to have kids with you and make it to 30 and have kids. [[00:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=3437.9199999999996s)]
*  And I don't think you and I will make it if if one of the requirements is monogamy. [[00:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=3444.48s)]
*  I just think we're fooling ourselves. [[00:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=3449.6800000000003s)]
*  Like if that be if that's one of the deal breakers, we're not going to make it to the [[00:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=3451.52s)]
*  part I want to make it to where we have a kid. [[00:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=3455.84s)]
*  And she was like, I don't. [[00:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=3458.88s)]
*  So what are you suggesting? [[00:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=3462.64s)]
*  I'm like, basically, like, I don't want to lose you over that. [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=3464.0s)]
*  I'm liable to do it. [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=3468.2400000000002s)]
*  And I feel like you're probably liable to do it. [[00:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=3469.04s)]
*  We just met cheating on each other, you know, to write. [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=3470.64s)]
*  And there was this kind of weird in a merry inch intermarry, whatever period where [[00:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=3473.92s)]
*  she like ended up chatting with her mom about it and all this stuff. [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=3483.36s)]
*  And then at some point, she just came to me and said, like, yeah, I guess if I don't know [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=3487.2000000000003s)]
*  anything, I don't really care. [[00:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=3491.44s)]
*  And I was like, yeah, and I don't I have no desire to know about anything, but I'm not [[00:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=3492.7200000000003s)]
*  going to require that from you. [[00:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=3497.44s)]
*  We both were just like, I'm not going to require that from you. [[00:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=3498.48s)]
*  So I was in an open relationship for nine years. [[00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=3500.8s)]
*  Wow. [[00:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=3503.04s)]
*  And we slept in the same bed every single night. [[00:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=3503.92s)]
*  We lived together. [[00:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=3507.76s)]
*  There was no like craziness. [[00:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=3509.04s)]
*  Mind you, I was also a fucking full blown addict during this period. [[00:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=3511.04s)]
*  But if she was at home, I don't know what happened when I was at home. [[00:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=3515.2000000000003s)]
*  She didn't know what happened. [[00:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=3517.84s)]
*  And that, to some degree, work. [[00:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=3519.04s)]
*  I mean, definitely work. [[00:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=3522.48s)]
*  We stayed together for nine years in our 20s, which is almost impossible. [[00:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=3523.36s)]
*  And I love her like crazy. [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=3526.96s)]
*  Still do. [[00:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=3528.88s)]
*  We're still really good friends. [[00:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=3529.28s)]
*  And both of our lives have worked out great. [[00:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=3530.8s)]
*  And I wouldn't say that that was the reason ultimately we broke up. [[00:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=3533.04s)]
*  But all that to say, going back to like getting older, being sober longer. [[00:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=3536.56s)]
*  I, you know, I would have liked to have been someone that could have just been monogamous [[00:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=3545.44s)]
*  with her. [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=3550.4s)]
*  I think she deserved that. [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=3550.96s)]
*  I also think, oh, yeah, I think even within the, the. [[00:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=3552.64s)]
*  With even within those rules, I was scumbaggy. [[00:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=3557.2799999999997s)]
*  Like I definitely hit on her friends sometimes. [[00:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=3561.04s)]
*  Like I did terrible shit under the guise of like, well, I'm not lying about this. [[00:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=3563.52s)]
*  I'm, I'm, I'm honest in that can be true. [[00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=3567.68s)]
*  And also you can recognize that people are hurt that you're leaving a wake of people [[00:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=3572.64s)]
*  that are bombed and hurt by you. [[00:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=3577.52s)]
*  And so it's like, great. [[00:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=3579.36s)]
*  I didn't lie and I'm above board, but people around me are kind of hurt by their experience [[00:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=3580.4s)]
*  with me. [[00:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=3585.04s)]
*  I don't like how that feels. [[00:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=3585.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=3586.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=3587.9199999999996s)]
*  Or like bring it like around your friends and they know what you're doing. [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=3588.16s)]
*  Just like all that. [[00:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=3590.64s)]
*  They all feel awkward. [[00:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=3591.4399999999996s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=3592.56s)]
*  It's like, what's going on here? [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=3592.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=3594.24s)]
*  That also, I think more like how many, because everyone, we're very open about it. [[00:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=3594.48s)]
*  Like, dude, I remember it was new year's Eve. [[00:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=3598.3199999999997s)]
*  And I was out of them, like in the mountains with some girl and all of her friends. [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=3603.2s)]
*  And then her friend and I ended up hooking up like in the closet upstairs. [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=3608.96s)]
*  And then a couple of hours later, she's like, did you hook up with my friend in the [[01:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=3613.7599999999998s)]
*  closet? [[01:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=3616.88s)]
*  And I was like, that's the dumbest thing I've ever heard of. [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=3618.0s)]
*  Right? [[01:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=3621.12s)]
*  That's crazy. [[01:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=3621.84s)]
*  I was like, let the shit out of me. [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=3622.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=3623.76s)]
*  Well, and we're all just at this. [[01:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=3624.0s)]
*  So stuff like that, I think I feel like, and some of those things I've had to like [[01:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=3625.6s)]
*  make amends for, you know, and like, I didn't do a ton of stuff like that, [[01:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=3628.8s)]
*  but there were certainly moments where it was like, I'd be in an instance where I had [[01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=3632.0s)]
*  somebody I really liked and cared about. [[01:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=3635.6s)]
*  And there was a, still a part of me that needed to get more validation or needed to be seen, [[01:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=3637.44s)]
*  you know? [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=3643.28s)]
*  And it wasn't always even about sex, but sometimes it's just like, I needed to know [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=3643.84s)]
*  if I could flirt or if that girl would give me some response, you know? [[01:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=3647.2000000000003s)]
*  Well, that's when you connect the dots that like, oh, because I connected these dots [[01:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=3650.5600000000004s)]
*  in sobriety, which is like, oh, this is the exact same thing. [[01:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=3655.44s)]
*  Like whether I want to acknowledge it or not, this sex thing and this approval thing [[01:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=3661.5200000000004s)]
*  is identical to cocaine. [[01:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=3666.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=3668.0800000000004s)]
*  Um, I had like the most visceral experience of my life that pointed that out to me. [[01:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=3668.7200000000003s)]
*  Well, I had two. [[01:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=3677.1200000000003s)]
*  Um, one was, and I was a few years sober and I was single and I was on my space. [[01:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=3678.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=3684.88s)]
*  And I was on TV. [[01:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=3685.44s)]
*  Oh my gosh. [[01:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=3687.04s)]
*  Yeah. Just take that in for a sec. [[01:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=3688.7200000000003s)]
*  So you were just damn Prince Charles or whatever. [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=3690.32s)]
*  I was enjoying the shit out of my space. [[01:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=3693.12s)]
*  And also I had not, I hadn't looked at the sex component as potentially harmful to me yet. [[01:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=3696.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=3703.04s)]
*  But I remember a gal came over. [[01:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=3704.24s)]
*  And you were good at sex, you said? [[01:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=3706.64s)]
*  I mean, what could be more nauseating than a guy saying they're good at sex out loud? [[01:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=3708.7999999999997s)]
*  So that's just a lose lose for me. [[01:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=3714.24s)]
*  We'll just pretend that you're okay. [[01:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=3715.7599999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=3716.96s)]
*  Okay. I certainly. [[01:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=3717.2s)]
*  Some people aren't good. [[01:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=3719.04s)]
*  Some people, you know. [[01:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=3719.7599999999998s)]
*  So let's be honest. [[01:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=3720.72s)]
*  The more you fuck the better you are. [[01:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=3721.36s)]
*  Like you're not coming as fast. [[01:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=3724.32s)]
*  Sure. [[01:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=3727.52s)]
*  You've had periods where you fucked seven days in a row. [[01:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=3727.7599999999998s)]
*  No, I never, I was always too lazy to do something like that. [[01:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=3730.64s)]
*  I think. [[01:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=3734.32s)]
*  Oh, really? [[01:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=3734.7999999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=3735.44s)]
*  You were saved by your lethargy. [[01:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=3735.7599999999998s)]
*  It's if they've had sex twice in a week or yeah, I was always very like, [[01:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=3738.32s)]
*  it was like, it took a while. [[01:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=3744.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=3746.4s)]
*  Just like, yeah. [[01:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=3746.64s)]
*  Well, okay. [[01:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=3748.16s)]
*  So I need to preface this by, [[01:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=3748.56s)]
*  I'm ashamed of this, what I'm about to tell you. [[01:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=3750.0s)]
*  Like I am ashamed of this, but this is very true. [[01:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=3752.96s)]
*  I was a few years sober. [[01:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=3757.04s)]
*  I was single. [[01:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=3759.04s)]
*  Someone had come over that I had met on my space [[01:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=3760.08s)]
*  and I was giving them a tour of the house. [[01:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=3763.12s)]
*  And I was in the first room of the tour and I had this thought that was like, [[01:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=3767.28s)]
*  oh, this tour is so long. [[01:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=3775.28s)]
*  You had a big house? [[01:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=3778.0s)]
*  No, I didn't have a big house. [[01:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=3779.36s)]
*  There was, I was like, but then I thought, what is this? [[01:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=3782.2400000000002s)]
*  I have a very familiar feeling. [[01:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=3787.92s)]
*  Like it's, it's, it's unmissable. [[01:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=3789.92s)]
*  This feeling I have right now. [[01:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=3791.6800000000003s)]
*  And I like took a second to try to figure out like, [[01:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=3793.44s)]
*  I know this feeling. [[01:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=3795.92s)]
*  I know this feeling. [[01:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=3796.6400000000003s)]
*  What is this? [[01:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=3797.36s)]
*  What is this? [[01:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=3797.76s)]
*  And I was like, oh my God, I know exactly what this is. [[01:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=3798.5600000000004s)]
*  This is sitting in my old drug dealer, Tom's living room while he measured out shit [[01:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=3801.28s)]
*  and told me about his fucking day and got distracted by telling me about his day. [[01:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=3806.96s)]
*  And I wanted to scream just like, fucking give me a bump and I'll listen to you forever, [[01:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=3811.92s)]
*  but fucking focus and give me the thing like that, that impatience. [[01:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=3816.96s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[01:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=3821.28s)]
*  Teamwork. [[01:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=3822.16s)]
*  You want teamwork. [[01:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=3822.7200000000003s)]
*  Yes. [[01:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=3823.76s)]
*  Just like knock off the bullshit. [[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=3824.2400000000002s)]
*  Give me the thing and then let's talk fucking be all ears for eternity. [[01:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=3827.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=3832.16s)]
*  But that feeling is so specific to me that in that moment in the room, I realized, [[01:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=3832.8s)]
*  oh my God, it's the same thing. [[01:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=3840.1600000000003s)]
*  I'm like, I need this woman to give me the thing I need. [[01:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=3842.4s)]
*  And I hate that. [[01:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=3846.7200000000003s)]
*  I hate that about myself. [[01:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=3847.92s)]
*  I hate that for her. [[01:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=3849.52s)]
*  I hate all of it. [[01:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=3851.36s)]
*  It's just, I don't want to be insatiably needing something from somebody [[01:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=3852.48s)]
*  and dependent on them giving me the thing. [[01:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=3857.84s)]
*  And I was like, whoa. [[01:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=3860.4s)]
*  So that was one moment where I was like, oh God, they're kind of the same thing. [[01:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=3862.8s)]
*  And once I recognize that, I'm like, I probably have to think about it in those terms. [[01:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=3869.04s)]
*  Like, do I feel worse about myself? [[01:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=3873.84s)]
*  Are people, you know, are they benefiting from, you know, whatever. [[01:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=3876.32s)]
*  Then the other crazy thing that happened that really sealed it for me was I was monogamous. [[01:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=3880.0s)]
*  It was for the first time in like a decade. [[01:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=3886.7200000000003s)]
*  And so, and then I was talking to my then girlfriend who was in Boston doing something [[01:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=3889.2799999999997s)]
*  and she told this story about bumping into somebody I knew she cheated on her ex boyfriend with. [[01:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=3894.0s)]
*  And they're all at the same hotel. [[01:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=3898.48s)]
*  I'm thinking like, well, I'm sure they fucked, right? [[01:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=3899.6s)]
*  So I'm like, I'm mad driving. [[01:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=3901.8399999999997s)]
*  I'm driving in the car on the 405 and I had been monogamous at that point for like three months. [[01:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=3903.3599999999997s)]
*  We get in a kind of fight over that and we hang up. [[01:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=3909.2s)]
*  And I just had this like swell, like a swell of horniness. [[01:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=3912.56s)]
*  The way you do when it's like, I gotta get coke or I got whatever that really big swell. [[01:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=3920.1600000000003s)]
*  And all of a sudden I was so horny and I was like, I'm gonna, I'm gonna text Kelly. [[01:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=3926.2400000000002s)]
*  I'm gonna text Kelly right now and I can stop by her. [[01:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=3931.44s)]
*  I'm not supposed to because I'm now monogamous. [[01:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=3936.56s)]
*  And then I just had a moment where I was like, that's interesting. [[01:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=3939.04s)]
*  You're, you're in a fight. [[01:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=3943.44s)]
*  You feel emasculated by whatever just happened and your body's smart enough to go, [[01:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=3945.44s)]
*  well, let's get horny. [[01:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=3951.36s)]
*  You won't have to feel any of this. [[01:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=3952.4s)]
*  If you're horny and we're at Kelly's house and you're getting validated and you come all this stuff. [[01:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=3954.0s)]
*  I was like, fuck, this is like a defense. [[01:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=3960.0s)]
*  Cause it just like any other thing. [[01:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=3963.76s)]
*  I'm so afraid of my feelings or feeling uncomfortable. [[01:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=3966.16s)]
*  Your body created some defense. [[01:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=3969.7599999999998s)]
*  My body was ahead of me. [[01:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=3971.12s)]
*  It's like I hung up. [[01:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=3972.16s)]
*  I didn't even register what had just happened. [[01:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=3973.2s)]
*  And all of a sudden I'm like, I am physically horny. [[01:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=3974.72s)]
*  It's not like I made it up. [[01:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=3977.2799999999997s)]
*  And those two things for me, I was like, yeah, this is a whole thing we gotta figure out. [[01:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=3979.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=3985.68s)]
*  Wow. [[01:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=3986.16s)]
*  Man. [[01:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=3988.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=3988.3199999999997s)]
*  That's the cra- that's the craziest part is that a lot of times it's not even you making a choice. [[01:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=3988.56s)]
*  It could be you choosing once you get the input, but your like physiologicalness is making the, [[01:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=3993.04s)]
*  it's dealing you the cards and you're like, and again, back to the brain, [[01:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4000.24s)]
*  the area of your brain that's now sucking up all the blood and running the show, [[01:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4003.36s)]
*  isn't the part of your brain, your neocortex, where you would think through all the things [[01:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4008.88s)]
*  that are going to happen after this. [[01:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4013.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4015.2s)]
*  It's like, you're not even, you're, these two areas can't be doing the thinking at the same time. [[01:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4015.44s)]
*  So once that swell of like craving comes about, this is offline. [[01:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4020.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4026.16s)]
*  You're like, I don't, I'm never going to see tomorrow or that's tomorrow Dax's problem. [[01:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4026.64s)]
*  You're right. [[01:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4030.96s)]
*  I feel bad for him, but today's Dax is about to get fucked up and feel good. [[01:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4032.4s)]
*  Yes. [[01:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4038.56s)]
*  Yes. [[01:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4039.12s)]
*  Like it, everything, the ability to have any comprehension really, or any forward thinking, [[01:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4039.6800000000003s)]
*  completely disappears. [[01:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4046.2400000000002s)]
*  That's crazy, bro. [[01:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4047.84s)]
*  I mean, it disappears. [[01:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4049.04s)]
*  Yeah, it's gone. [[01:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4050.8s)]
*  It's unbelievable. [[01:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4051.7599999999998s)]
*  You can't access it. [[01:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4052.32s)]
*  No. [[01:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4053.04s)]
*  I mean, my biggest thing was just that one of the things I ran into was just commitment. [[01:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4053.44s)]
*  A lot of times I would get into a relationship and then I just could not be committed. [[01:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4056.96s)]
*  Like I couldn't be committed. [[01:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4060.64s)]
*  I just couldn't do it. [[01:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4063.36s)]
*  You know. [[01:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4065.36s)]
*  What's your explanation of that? [[01:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4066.08s)]
*  Was it because you, you wanted to hook up with other girls or is it because you thought [[01:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4067.84s)]
*  ultimately they would see that you're a piece of shit and be out? [[01:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4072.64s)]
*  I wanted to have the option to do what I wanted to do. [[01:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4076.72s)]
*  I wanted to be, I wanted. [[01:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4079.36s)]
*  You wanted it all. [[01:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4081.28s)]
*  You want to go to Sizzler. [[01:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4082.08s)]
*  Yeah, I don't know if I wanted it all. [[01:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4083.6800000000003s)]
*  And I'm in the mood for sale. [[01:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4085.12s)]
*  I did. [[01:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4086.4s)]
*  And I'm in the mood for fuck-up. [[01:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4086.8s)]
*  No, no, I just didn't, I just didn't want, I didn't want to have somebody else like define me. [[01:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4088.08s)]
*  There's a part of me that really doesn't trust having somebody else define me in a way. [[01:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4099.52s)]
*  Does it make any sense or no? [[01:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4105.92s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[01:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4107.04s)]
*  I was like, even I remembered like when I had a girlfriend, I would, a lot of times I wouldn't [[01:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4107.92s)]
*  even say this is my girlfriend. [[01:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4111.68s)]
*  I would say this is my friend and then their name and some of that, a lot of that stuff I feel bad [[01:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4113.84s)]
*  about, man, it was, you know, because it's not fair to them, you know, like, so it was that sort [[01:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4118.16s)]
*  of thing. [[01:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4123.6s)]
*  It was like, I just, I just, there's something I just had the toughest time with letting somebody [[01:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4123.84s)]
*  else define me. [[01:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4128.64s)]
*  But do you think, and I don't want to speak poorly of your mother, but do you think it's okay to [[01:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4129.68s)]
*  suggest that since mom didn't have your best interest in mind, that it was going to be pretty [[01:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4134.08s)]
*  hard for you to imagine that anyone was going to have your best interest in mind? [[01:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4141.12s)]
*  I think there could be some truth to that. [[01:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4146.4s)]
*  I just don't know. [[01:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4148.08s)]
*  It's hard for me to get there in my head. [[01:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4153.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4154.96s)]
*  Like, um. [[01:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4155.5199999999995s)]
*  Or like intellectually, you could maybe see the thread, but it doesn't feel like anything real. [[01:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4156.48s)]
*  Right. [[01:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4161.5199999999995s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4162.24s)]
*  And for a lot of times for me, I got to get to that feeling space, you know, for it to activate [[01:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4162.56s)]
*  inside of you, you know? [[01:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4166.0s)]
*  So I just think my mom was just super big, you know, there just wasn't a connection there. [[01:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4167.4400000000005s)]
*  And I really wanted it. [[01:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4172.4800000000005s)]
*  How old were you when your dad died? [[01:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4174.4800000000005s)]
*  I was 16. [[01:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4176.160000000001s)]
*  So, and he was very old, you know, but he was cool. [[01:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4177.76s)]
*  I mean, he was old, but my mom would come to the baseball games. [[01:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4181.280000000001s)]
*  My mom was kind of a fucking gangster in a lot of ways. [[01:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4184.96s)]
*  She would come to the baseball games and she would fucking scream, [[01:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4188.080000000001s)]
*  hit it or we're leaving from her fucking Astro van. [[01:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4191.68s)]
*  And bro, I was already horrible at baseball. [[01:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4199.92s)]
*  I was horrible. [[01:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4202.88s)]
*  Hit it or we're leaving. [[01:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4204.320000000001s)]
*  She would yell. [[01:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4205.4400000000005s)]
*  She didn't have any patience for. [[01:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4206.160000000001s)]
*  Fourth inning every time we were gone. [[01:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4207.84s)]
*  Really? [[01:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4210.0s)]
*  Oh, dude. [[01:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4210.320000000001s)]
*  She would pull you. [[01:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4210.88s)]
*  All right. [[01:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4213.92s)]
*  He had five chances. [[01:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4214.160000000001s)]
*  Let's go. [[01:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4215.84s)]
*  She would pull me from the game. [[01:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4216.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4218.799999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4219.44s)]
*  Sounds like she had your best interest in mind. [[01:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4219.679999999999s)]
*  Totally. [[01:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4222.24s)]
*  She was just surviving, you know? [[01:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4223.44s)]
*  Yes. [[01:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4225.679999999999s)]
*  But again, you can be sympathetic and not judgmental to it, but also acknowledge what happened. [[01:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4226.4s)]
*  Right. [[01:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4231.12s)]
*  And I think that's still where I'm at. [[01:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4231.44s)]
*  Like it's still like there's still a part of me that has like a lot of resentment. [[01:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4232.639999999999s)]
*  I think you'll have kids one day. [[01:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4235.36s)]
*  And it'll change it all. [[01:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4237.12s)]
*  It will because you'll start just, you know, subconsciously or you'll just be evaluating like, [[01:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4238.24s)]
*  where was I when I was three? [[01:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4245.76s)]
*  Like, where was like, I remember my daughter came in, our oldest daughter. [[01:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4246.88s)]
*  This was probably a year and a half ago. [[01:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4251.52s)]
*  She came in and she was like, she had had a nightmare that me and Kristen got divorced, [[01:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4253.280000000001s)]
*  that mom and dad got divorced. [[01:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4258.72s)]
*  And I said, okay, well, you know, what happened? [[01:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4260.88s)]
*  Someone cheated. [[01:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4266.080000000001s)]
*  I think mom cheated on dad. [[01:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4266.8s)]
*  And I said, okay, well, a couple of things. [[01:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4268.400000000001s)]
*  I would never divorce your mom if she cheated on me. [[01:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4271.76s)]
*  We would work through that. [[01:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4274.48s)]
*  Like we're, that's not going to happen, but let's say it happened. [[01:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4275.599999999999s)]
*  What would then, what would go on? [[01:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4279.2s)]
*  What would happen next? [[01:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4281.04s)]
*  You say, well, we wouldn't live together. [[01:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4282.5599999999995s)]
*  And I'm like, yeah, but I'd buy the house next door and I will be with you nonstop. [[01:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4284.0s)]
*  Like I'm not going anywhere. [[01:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4290.879999999999s)]
*  No matter what happens, that's not going to happen. [[01:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4292.48s)]
*  But if, if, if that happened, I'm living next door to you and you come and see me whenever you want. [[01:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4295.12s)]
*  And maybe your mom will date someone that's really cool. [[01:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4302.08s)]
*  Maybe there'll be another cool person in your life. [[01:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4304.8s)]
*  Like that's, we don't know what it would be. [[01:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4307.04s)]
*  But while I was saying all this to her, I was looking at her and all of a sudden I was just like, oh, [[01:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4310.48s)]
*  she's nine by nine. [[01:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4316.96s)]
*  I'm on my third stepdad and I've already been molested. [[01:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4320.719999999999s)]
*  And I'm looking at her. [[01:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4327.679999999999s)]
*  I'm like, no, no, she's way too little. [[01:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4328.5599999999995s)]
*  To be on her third dad and to have been molested. [[01:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4331.28s)]
*  Right. [[01:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4334.719999999999s)]
*  Like jeepers. [[01:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4334.96s)]
*  You have like a compassion for yourself because I think in my mind, I'm always older than I really was, [[01:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4336.32s)]
*  or I felt with it or I knew the score. [[01:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4342.08s)]
*  You felt responsible. [[01:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4344.719999999999s)]
*  Yes. [[01:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4345.84s)]
*  And in many ways I was. [[01:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4346.32s)]
*  Right. [[01:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4348.16s)]
*  And again, I'm palling around my brother who's five years older than me. [[01:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4348.32s)]
*  So it was always a little bit five years ahead. [[01:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4350.96s)]
*  But I look at this little girl and I think, oh yeah, that's way, way too many things to have happened to a nine year old. [[01:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4352.24s)]
*  Wow. [[01:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4359.28s)]
*  Right. [[01:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4360.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4361.759999999999s)]
*  That's kind of interesting. [[01:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4362.08s)]
*  I think I probably need to get to that place in my life. [[01:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4362.96s)]
*  I would like to. [[01:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4365.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4366.16s)]
*  I'm definitely like, yeah, I'm tired of kind of living in the same place sometimes. [[01:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4366.4s)]
*  You know, so I'm just working on some of that stuff with my sponsor. [[01:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4372.16s)]
*  What's the longest you've been with a girl? [[01:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4375.599999999999s)]
*  Girl, probably three years, maybe. [[01:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4378.08s)]
*  So pretty long, I feel like. [[01:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4381.04s)]
*  And so yeah, it'll happen. [[01:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4382.96s)]
*  And then also I fell in love with my work. [[01:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4385.759999999999s)]
*  You know, that's one thing I really fell in love with. [[01:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4387.28s)]
*  Like, I love to work. [[01:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4388.96s)]
*  You know, I love to work. [[01:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4390.64s)]

*  Like. [[01:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4393.52s)]
*  How many days a year are you touring, doing stand up? [[01:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4394.320000000001s)]
*  I don't know, maybe a hundred and maybe a hundred shows a year. [[01:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4398.240000000001s)]
*  A hundred. [[01:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4401.68s)]
*  And then you're where in Nashville the rest of the time? [[01:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4403.200000000001s)]
*  Yeah, Nashville or. [[01:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4406.320000000001s)]
*  You know, I'm building a house in Nashville. [[01:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4408.0s)]
*  Hey, you told me that. [[01:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4409.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4410.4800000000005s)]
*  Overtax is crazy. [[01:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4410.72s)]
*  So we're going to be like best friends in Tennessee. [[01:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4410.96s)]
*  This is so exciting. [[01:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4414.4800000000005s)]
*  Maybe we should meet up in our tour buses like at. [[01:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4416.160000000001s)]
*  At a Waffle House or something. [[01:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4418.639999999999s)]
*  Yeah, dude, that'd be cool. [[01:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4420.879999999999s)]
*  What made you guys choose Nashville? [[01:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4424.08s)]
*  Well, it started with like I grew up around a bazillion lakes [[01:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4426.639999999999s)]
*  where I'm from in Michigan. [[01:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4430.719999999999s)]
*  It's just lakes everywhere. [[01:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4431.839999999999s)]
*  Oh, so it's rural Michigan. [[01:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4433.04s)]
*  Yeah, so I was. [[01:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4434.5599999999995s)]
*  I was. [[01:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4436.08s)]
*  Charlotte was so beautiful. [[01:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4436.879999999999s)]
*  No, not that far out. [[01:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4438.16s)]
*  Oh my God. [[01:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4439.28s)]
*  Have you been there? [[01:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4439.759999999999s)]
*  Kid Rock always talks about it all the time. [[01:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4440.5599999999995s)]
*  No, it's preposterously beautiful. [[01:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4442.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4444.16s)]
*  In fact, you go there and you're like, this is in the USA. [[01:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4444.5599999999995s)]
*  Like the that area of Michigan, the water's turquoise blue like the Caribbean. [[01:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4447.76s)]
*  Wow. [[01:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4452.24s)]

*  And they have these Patoskey stones which are all tortoise to like turtle. [[01:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4455.76s)]
*  They're impossibly beautiful. [[01:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4459.12s)]
*  Flat stones for skipp. [[01:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4460.64s)]
*  It's credible. [[01:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4461.68s)]
*  But initially we were going to. [[01:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4462.64s)]
*  I found a house I wanted to get there. [[01:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4464.72s)]
*  I kind of wanted to live out my fantasy of growing up broke, [[01:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4467.12s)]
*  driving by the houses on a certain lake. [[01:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4469.84s)]
*  And I was home visiting my best friend, Aaron. [[01:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4472.0s)]
*  And I was driving by that lake and I was like, oh, shit, son, [[01:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4474.16s)]
*  you could fucking have a house on that lake now. [[01:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4477.28s)]
*  Like that happened. [[01:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4479.679999999999s)]
*  And I was like, I was weird. [[01:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4481.12s)]
*  I was like, that happened. [[01:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4483.36s)]
*  Was it scary, though, to like lean into like a newer you that like [[01:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4484.8s)]
*  has like money and all of that and opportunity and stuff like that? [[01:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4491.2s)]
*  Sometimes I think I feel a little bit like. [[01:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4496.24s)]
*  Yeah, like it's just like. [[01:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4501.5199999999995s)]
*  It doesn't fit well or. [[01:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4504.08s)]
*  Yeah, I think sometimes I feel like it doesn't fit well. [[01:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4505.6s)]
*  Sometimes I feel like, yeah, I've talked about this before, [[01:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4507.280000000001s)]
*  but it's like I don't want to put it's like I kind of like where I am. [[01:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4508.96s)]
*  Yeah, but is it that or is it that you're afraid? [[01:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4514.080000000001s)]
*  I'm afraid what people will think of me. [[01:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4517.200000000001s)]
*  Yes. [[01:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4518.56s)]
*  So I have that too. [[01:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4518.96s)]
*  Like I'm from a very blue collar. [[01:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4520.080000000001s)]
*  Half the town was on welfare. [[01:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4522.240000000001s)]
*  There's a fight in school three or four times a day, you know. [[01:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4524.4800000000005s)]
*  Violent, drunk, blue collar place. [[01:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4529.040000000001s)]
*  It's the last suburb. [[01:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4532.64s)]
*  You know what's that like a union? [[01:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4534.24s)]
*  Yes, yes. [[01:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4536.96s)]
*  Everyone's parents were in the UAW where I grew up, [[01:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4537.68s)]
*  but it's the last suburb out of Detroit before it turns to just cornfields. [[01:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4540.96s)]
*  So it's like if you went east, it got like more and more built up. [[01:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4546.32s)]
*  But if you went west of where I was from, it was just pastures. [[01:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4550.48s)]
*  The kids got on my bus with horseshit all over their boots from shoveling. [[01:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4553.2s)]
*  So it was like Hillbilly. [[01:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4557.36s)]
*  It was near. [[01:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4558.96s)]
*  Is that near? [[01:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4559.92s)]
*  I went to Muir Junior High. [[01:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4560.32s)]

*  Yeah. [[01:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4574.96s)]

*  Wow, interesting. [[01:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4581.52s)]
*  I hated rich people. [[01:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4582.240000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4583.4400000000005s)]
*  I grew up, I hated rich people. [[01:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4583.92s)]
*  They were the enemy, right? [[01:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4585.76s)]
*  I still hate them. [[01:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4586.72s)]
*  Yeah, I know. [[01:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4587.68s)]
*  That's hard to come to peace with for me, which is like, [[01:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4589.76s)]
*  at what point are you just a fraud? [[01:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4593.92s)]
*  Because you're a rich dude now. [[01:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4595.76s)]
*  And I can't identify with that because I hated rich people. [[01:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4597.84s)]
*  They were the enemy. [[01:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4601.52s)]
*  They were the people that made you feel shitty and that looked down on you. [[01:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4602.56s)]
*  Yeah, well, we had a veterinarian, dude, and he... [[01:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4606.0s)]
*  Our street was like... [[01:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4609.12s)]
*  People would go from town and they would cut through our neighborhood [[01:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4611.28s)]
*  to go to the nicer area where people lived at. [[01:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4614.08s)]
*  And he was like a veterinarian and he would throw out [[01:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4617.76s)]
*  like the dead animal stuff in our ditch all the time. [[01:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4621.04s)]
*  Oh, wow. [[01:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4624.08s)]
*  And like, yeah, he would literally stop a fucking black Mercedes. [[01:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4624.8s)]
*  Drop off six or seven cats. [[01:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4628.0s)]
*  Oh, he's just dropping off a bunch of fucking Bichon carcasses [[01:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4629.28s)]
*  and just hitting the road up there to Richville. [[01:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4633.76s)]
*  And we would all get out there and yell and call him queer or whatever. [[01:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4636.72s)]
*  And then fry up the food and thank him and thank Jesus for the meal. [[01:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4639.28s)]
*  No, we would throw like the bones at each other. [[01:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4643.52s)]
*  We would make like dinosaurs out of the bones and hide them and shit and fucking... [[01:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4646.56s)]
*  But I think something like that. [[01:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4651.120000000001s)]
*  Yeah, there was... [[01:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4652.56s)]
*  Well, the rich were always an enemy, you know? [[01:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4653.120000000001s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[01:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4655.280000000001s)]
*  You always had to have an enemy, you know? [[01:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4655.76s)]
*  So I think there's still good enemies to find out there. [[01:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4658.400000000001s)]
*  And maybe they're not all rich. [[01:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4661.120000000001s)]
*  Maybe it's just more about like greed or like... [[01:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4662.320000000001s)]
*  Well, the thing that I'm entertaining is like, yeah, that's going to happen. [[01:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4664.72s)]
*  People who are my people are going to hate me because I'm rich. [[01:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4673.84s)]
*  What can I do about that? [[01:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4680.160000000001s)]
*  Like that's their thing, just like it was my thing. [[01:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4681.200000000001s)]
*  And to pretend I'm something other than I'm not feels like an even bigger contradiction or hypocrisy. [[01:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4684.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4696.0s)]
*  Right? [[01:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4696.4800000000005s)]
*  Like I got to be realistic. [[01:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4696.88s)]
*  I'm still... [[01:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4698.88s)]
*  I still feel very comfortable in the shit. [[01:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4699.84s)]
*  Most comfortable. [[01:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4704.080000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4705.200000000001s)]
*  And so I think if you met me, whatever you thought or you were mad about, [[01:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4705.68s)]
*  I don't think you would feel that way. [[01:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4712.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4715.360000000001s)]
*  I'm not above anyone. [[01:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4715.68s)]
*  I just... [[01:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4717.120000000001s)]
*  I got some paper and I fucking love it and I want to keep it. [[01:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4717.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4719.84s)]
*  That's all I wanted. [[01:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4720.240000000001s)]
*  I fucking been working so hard to get that fucking paper. [[01:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4721.360000000001s)]
*  I didn't want to be a rich guy, but I wanted the paper more than anyone else I ever read. [[01:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4724.72s)]
*  Oh, that's interesting. [[01:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4728.96s)]
*  So... [[01:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4730.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4731.4400000000005s)]
*  And I think also being rich can be like an attitude too. [[01:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4731.68s)]
*  I think that's a lot of it. [[01:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4734.88s)]
*  It's like there was something about the attitude of it. [[01:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4736.16s)]
*  Nepotism, shit like that I don't like. [[01:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4738.96s)]
*  I didn't like... [[01:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4740.96s)]
*  That's some of the shit I just... [[01:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4742.4800000000005s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4744.32s)]
*  I still have a chip on my shoulder about like the kind of East Coast, [[01:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4744.8s)]
*  blue bloody, these schools, the dress. [[01:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4748.400000000001s)]
*  But dude, I went to vacation this year with my kids in Martha's Vineyard. [[01:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4753.52s)]
*  Right. [[01:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4759.84s)]
*  So yeah. [[01:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4760.08s)]
*  And I'm like, well, what are we going to do here? [[01:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4760.88s)]
*  How are we going to play this? [[01:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4763.5199999999995s)]
*  We're going to act like... [[01:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4764.48s)]
*  You can't be there and act like you don't go there. [[01:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4765.84s)]
*  My wife was like, why do you want to go to Martha's Vineyard? [[01:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4768.72s)]
*  And I'm like, those Kennedys could go anywhere. [[01:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4770.5599999999995s)]
*  The Kennedys were the gangsters of all gangsters. [[01:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4773.6s)]
*  They could go anywhere. [[01:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4776.16s)]
*  If they went there and set up shop, there has to be something there. [[01:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4778.0s)]
*  Oh, I see you're saying. [[01:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4782.48s)]
*  Like I got to see why the people that could have done anything landed there. [[01:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4783.5199999999995s)]
*  Oh, that's interesting. [[01:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4788.4s)]
*  I was like curious. [[01:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4789.44s)]
*  And I went there and was like, oh yeah, no shit people. [[01:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4790.719999999999s)]
*  I can hear it's fucking incredible. [[01:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4792.88s)]
*  Is it nice? [[01:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4794.639999999999s)]
*  Yes. [[01:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4795.599999999999s)]
*  And again, this is when I tell myself what's nice about it is like, [[01:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4796.32s)]
*  hey, it's just fucking gorgeous. [[01:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4799.5199999999995s)]
*  Have you been to Daytona Beach? [[01:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4800.799999999999s)]
*  A million times. [[01:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4802.48s)]
*  That's where we go for our winter break. [[01:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4803.04s)]
*  My mom would drive us in a van and we would sleep in the van down at Daytona. [[01:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4805.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4810.0s)]
*  I hadn't been there before. [[01:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4810.16s)]
*  It blew my mind. [[01:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4811.599999999999s)]
*  But a different vibe than Martha's Vineyard. [[01:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4813.759999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4815.599999999999s)]
*  I can imagine that. [[01:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4816.0s)]
*  You go to Ron John down in Cocoa Beach? [[01:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4816.719999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4819.759999999999s)]
*  I've been over there, dude. [[01:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4820.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4821.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4821.679999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4822.799999999999s)]
*  I've been over there. [[01:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4823.04s)]
*  I was like in the Ron John shirt when I was a kid. [[01:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4823.599999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4825.36s)]
*  That was the best. [[01:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4825.599999999999s)]
*  And the sand is so hard packed in Daytona that my brother and I remember going there. [[01:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4827.36s)]
*  This is what always happened. [[01:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4831.599999999999s)]
*  We would drive down in a van, the four of us. [[01:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4832.639999999999s)]
*  We'd sleep in the van and it would always be the shittiest weather that Florida had the whole year. [[01:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4835.44s)]
*  We'd be leaving Michigan in the snow and then we would get there all excited and then it'd be like 49. [[01:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4840.08s)]
*  So one day we were there, it was raining, it was cold as hell, [[01:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4844.96s)]
*  but the sand was so hard packed that my brother and I were on our skateboards and we had windbreakers. [[01:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4848.0s)]
*  And the wind just pushed us down the beach on our skateboards, flying. [[01:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4853.04s)]
*  One of my greatest memories of my whole life. [[01:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4858.48s)]
*  That's such a good feeling, dude. [[01:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4860.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4862.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4863.28s)]
*  Do you? [[01:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4863.84s)]
*  Skateboard on the beach. [[01:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4864.32s)]
*  I don't even know how you would do it. [[01:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4866.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4867.36s)]
*  Oh, on the boardwalk. [[01:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4867.44s)]
*  No, on the sand. [[01:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4868.64s)]
*  Oh, wow. [[01:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4870.24s)]
*  I know people listening would probably not believe this, but like if- [[01:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4870.8s)]
*  Yeah, I don't believe it. [[01:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4873.2s)]
*  A, everyone drives on it. [[01:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4873.92s)]
*  So it's just like really packed down. [[01:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4875.2s)]
*  And then if it rains, it was just like being on concrete. [[01:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4876.48s)]
*  Damn. [[01:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4879.5199999999995s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4880.08s)]
*  Oh, what a moment. [[01:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4880.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4881.679999999999s)]
*  What's Martha's Vineyard like? [[01:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4881.919999999999s)]
*  I think of it as like there's ducks kind of. [[01:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4883.28s)]
*  There are ducks. [[01:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4885.919999999999s)]
*  You're going to find all variety of waterfowl there. [[01:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4886.879999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4889.759999999999s)]
*  And there's a lot of- [[01:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4890.32s)]
*  But I'll tell you the thing that I'll say. [[01:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4891.5199999999995s)]
*  They do have a restriction on how big of a house you can build there. [[01:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4893.12s)]
*  So like this place versus the Hamptons. [[01:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4897.599999999999s)]
*  Right. [[01:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4901.839999999999s)]
*  So the Hamptons detracts billionaires. [[01:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4902.48s)]
*  Martha's Vineyard is millionaires. [[01:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4905.68s)]
*  I know that's a stupid distinction to make, but for me, [[01:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4908.08s)]
*  still with this weird class warfare thing, I was like, okay, well, there's no yachts out here. [[01:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4911.68s)]
*  There's no people with like 40,000 square foot houses and everyone's- [[01:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4915.68s)]
*  No one's flashy. [[01:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4920.88s)]
*  Everyone drives around in like vintage cars. [[01:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4921.6s)]
*  There's no like Bentleys and shit. [[01:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4923.4400000000005s)]
*  It's like everyone's in old Cherokee and stuff. [[01:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4924.72s)]
*  You got Michelle and- [[01:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4927.4400000000005s)]
*  They live here. [[01:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4929.92s)]
*  They got a spot. [[01:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4931.04s)]
*  Their house looks to be bigger than the square footage. [[01:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4932.0s)]
*  A lot, man. [[01:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4935.84s)]
*  A lot. [[01:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4936.32s)]
*  Yeah, that definitely looks like it's a lot of- [[01:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4937.04s)]
*  Yeah, it looks like there was at least a kickback of a bedriver too. [[01:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4939.6s)]
*  Yeah. That might be some kind of presidential clause. [[01:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4943.04s)]
*  Yeah. Bobby Kennedy's always up there. He always talks about it. [[01:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4946.48s)]
*  And just growing up there and- [[01:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4950.24s)]
*  Yeah, they have the- what is it? Kenny- [[01:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4952.0s)]
*  Kenny Bunkport? [[01:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4955.36s)]
*  There it is. [[01:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4956.16s)]
*  Is that their whole thing? [[01:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4956.8s)]
*  Yeah, so you cross a little bridge out of Martha's Vineyard into a tinier island that's called- [[01:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4958.08s)]
*  Wow. [[01:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4965.36s)]
*  Hyannisport? [[01:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4966.08s)]
*  Yes. [[01:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4967.04s)]
*  That's where Ted Kennedy crashed. [[01:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4968.48s)]
*  No. [[01:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4970.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4971.6s)]
*  Oh, man. [[01:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4972.48s)]
*  They- [[01:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4973.04s)]
*  There's not a single stoplight on the whole island. [[01:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4973.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4975.68s)]
*  It's just all stop signs. [[01:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4976.08s)]
*  Do you think they'd put one in after what happened to Ted Kennedy? [[01:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4977.12s)]
*  You would think they would have put cameras everywhere and- [[01:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4979.04s)]
*  Yeah, dude. Oh, I can't believe that. [[01:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4982.24s)]
*  Yeah, I can't even imagine you pull up and somebody just- [[01:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4984.16s)]
*  Just making just salmon or whatever on the porch. [[01:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4988.8s)]
*  Fresh salmon they just host in. [[01:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4992.8s)]
*  But yeah, I think maybe your money thing is a little bit like you'd be betraying. [[01:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=4994.88s)]
*  It's just interesting to see what it's like. [[01:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=5000.32s)]
*  Okay, well, never had any money. Now I have some money. [[01:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=5001.92s)]
*  What's this like, you know? [[01:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=5004.8s)]
*  I mean, the nicest part is being able to eat whatever you want. [[01:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=5006.08s)]
*  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. [[01:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=5010.48s)]
*  That's the best, dude. [[01:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=5011.5199999999995s)]
*  And you go to a restaurant and you know that you can pay the tab if your friends want to eat. [[01:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=5012.4s)]
*  Yeah, the two- there's three things that will make me feel rich. [[01:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=5016.32s)]
*  Because I was in LA for 10 years trying to get a job acting and couldn't. [[01:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=5021.92s)]
*  So I was living on eight grand a year for like a decade in Santa Monica. [[01:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=5026.08s)]
*  So like I could never order pizza. [[01:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=5030.24s)]
*  I wanted pizza so fucking bad. [[01:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=5032.08s)]
*  I could just barely stay drunk on my budget. [[01:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=5033.92s)]
*  And then I had to really be entertaining to the dudes who had coke. [[01:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=5036.48s)]
*  But- or is it going with that? [[01:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=5039.679999999999s)]
*  8,000. [[01:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=5042.799999999999s)]
*  Oh, so now when I order pizza, I'm like, yeah, four. [[01:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=5044.4s)]
*  My wife's like, we need one. [[01:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=5049.12s)]
*  I'm like, we'll get four. [[01:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=5050.5599999999995s)]
*  And I feel so rich that I can order any fucking amount of pizzas I want. [[01:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=5053.28s)]
*  The other thing is I go to the gas station and I'm not even sure what it is a gallon. [[01:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=5058.48s)]
*  And I love that feeling. [[01:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=5064.48s)]
*  I used to fill up my fucking Honda Civic like halfway. [[01:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=5065.679999999999s)]
*  And if it was 10 cents more, I was stressed. [[01:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=5069.36s)]
*  So just getting gas, I feel like a bazillionaire. [[01:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=5071.68s)]
*  And the other thing is a second fridge with beverages in it. [[01:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=5075.360000000001s)]
*  That's what like kids I grew up with that were rich. [[01:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=5078.72s)]
*  They had another fridge in their garage with all kinds of beverages. [[01:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=5081.200000000001s)]
*  So those three things have me feeling like a Rockefeller. [[01:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=5084.96s)]
*  Dude, we had this cereal closet. [[01:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=5089.120000000001s)]
*  We ate cereal probably, I would say, 400 nights a year. [[01:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=5090.88s)]
*  Uh huh. [[01:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=5097.84s)]
*  And I remember we had this cereal closet. [[01:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=5099.04s)]
*  And sometimes if you were hungry, my mom would literally put you in it. [[01:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=5102.0s)]
*  There was no light in there. [[01:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=5104.5599999999995s)]
*  There was 26 boxes of cereal in there. [[01:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=5105.679999999999s)]
*  And she'd be like, don't come out until you are full. [[01:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=5107.84s)]
*  Just go in there in the dark and fucking eat cereal. [[01:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=5111.44s)]
*  And would you eat it with milk in a bowl? [[01:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=5113.84s)]
*  No, you just fucking get your hand in there and enjoy yourself like a fucking man. [[01:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=5115.44s)]
*  But that kind of shit I loved, man. [[01:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=5120.719999999999s)]
*  They just said, I just saw something the other day about the endless shrimp. [[01:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=5123.84s)]
*  They were having people ruined it. [[01:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=5126.48s)]
*  They were losing money. [[01:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=5129.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=5130.879999999999s)]
*  Red lobster. [[01:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=5131.2s)]
*  Oh, yeah, here it is. [[01:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=5132.879999999999s)]
*  Endless shrimp is financially ruining red lobster. [[01:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=5133.599999999999s)]
*  I lived for a fucking endless anything when it was broke. [[01:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=5137.679999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=5141.28s)]
*  Endless tits. [[01:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=5141.5199999999995s)]
*  Dude, my fucking buddy's mom had. [[01:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=5142.4s)]
*  I remember that for sure, dude. [[01:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=5143.839999999999s)]
*  Oh, she had those. [[01:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=5147.5199999999995s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=5149.44s)]
*  You had to get up early and feed those tits. [[01:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=5149.679999999999s)]
*  Those things had milk in them. [[01:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=5151.759999999999s)]
*  You know? [[01:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=5154.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=5154.96s)]
*  Lobster in an earnings report in early November, Ludovic Regis. [[01:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=5155.52s)]
*  Oh, my God. [[01:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=5162.160000000001s)]
*  They lost 11 million dollars giving shrimp out. [[01:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=5162.64s)]
*  I think like every company in the world is now operating like a startup was like they're [[01:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=5167.92s)]
*  they think it's a good idea to just be hemorrhaging money the whole time and just grow, grow, grow. [[01:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=5171.92s)]
*  They're like, fuck it. [[01:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=5176.72s)]
*  We'll worry about this later. [[01:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=5177.360000000001s)]
*  We need more red lobsters on every corner. [[01:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=5178.56s)]
*  The Thai Union Group, which owns red lobster, announced that its ultimate endless shrimp [[01:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=5181.04s)]
*  deal, which is normally a limited time offer, but was added to the daily menu in June. [[01:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=5186.16s)]
*  Wow. [[01:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=5190.24s)]
*  Was it exceedingly popular that it's so popular cause a restaurant to post an operating loss [[01:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=5191.04s)]
*  of more than 11 million. [[01:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=5196.08s)]
*  How would you not after a week, look at the books and be like, hey, the shrimp has to end. [[01:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=5198.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=5205.2s)]
*  I don't know how it took them to the end of the year. [[01:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=5205.759999999999s)]
*  We want to keep it on the menu. [[01:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=5207.839999999999s)]
*  The guy says, uh, and of course we need to be much more careful regarding what are the [[01:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=5209.2s)]
*  entry points and what is the price point we're offering now for $25 guests can choose two [[01:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=5214.24s)]
*  shrimp centric options. [[01:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=5219.92s)]
*  When they are ready for more, they can order additional shrimp selections. [[01:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=5222.4s)]
*  We had a place called the big shrimp over there and people would go there and fucking [[01:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=5225.84s)]
*  they had a, um, cheddar Bay biscuits though. [[01:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=5230.88s)]
*  Oh, those things are incredible. [[01:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=5234.16s)]
*  There's remember the first time you ate it, uh, red lobster. [[01:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=5236.48s)]
*  Mine's crystal clear. [[01:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=5239.28s)]
*  We had a place called the big shrimp and it was not a red lobster and they had a huge, um, [[01:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=5240.4s)]
*  they had like a, uh, stuffed shrimp, like mascot or whatever outside on Friday night. [[01:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=5247.76s)]
*  And, uh, people would always just drive by and just like call him a homosexual or whatever. [[01:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=5253.36s)]
*  It's pretty sad, you know, and they shouldn't have, but, but we did it. [[01:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=5258.48s)]
*  It was just that kind of, [[01:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=5264.4s)]
*  I try to explain to people like, like when I grew up littering, not only was literally, [[01:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=5265.36s)]
*  it wasn't a thing. [[01:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=5270.32s)]
*  Literally, like littering. [[01:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=5271.679999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=5272.88s)]

*  Having an Ian. [[01:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=5921.599999999999s)]
*  That was me between eighth grade and ninth grade. [[01:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=5922.719999999999s)]
*  So again, I had this Muir Junior High. [[01:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=5925.6s)]
*  I have my basketball physical I had to take to do eighth grade basketball. [[01:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=5928.56s)]
*  And then I have the ninth grade one. [[01:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=5933.4400000000005s)]
*  I did not make the team in ninth grade. [[01:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=5935.360000000001s)]
*  But in eighth grade, I was 5'11 in 159. [[01:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=5936.8s)]
*  Tall. [[01:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=5943.200000000001s)]
*  And then in ninth grade, I was 6'3, 149. [[01:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=5943.68s)]
*  So I lost 10 pounds. [[01:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=5949.120000000001s)]
*  Math. [[01:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=5950.96s)]
*  Grew four inches. [[01:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=5951.4400000000005s)]
*  I had a terrible, I was still following my brother's directions. [[01:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=5953.12s)]
*  And he was in a perm phase. [[01:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=5956.32s)]
*  So he convinced me to get a perm on top and it was super long in the back. [[01:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=5958.16s)]
*  Yeah, I had a perm on top. [[01:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=5961.44s)]
*  It was crazy long. [[01:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=5964.64s)]
*  The bat wasn't perm, right? [[01:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=5966.32s)]
*  So it was just fucking straight. [[01:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=5967.84s)]
*  But up top had a lot of body. [[01:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=5969.92s)]
*  And then my nose just got huge and my chin retracted. [[01:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=5971.76s)]
*  And I got super tall and skinny. [[01:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=5974.96s)]
*  And I was just like, and then I went to a new high school. [[01:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=5976.88s)]
*  Oh, fuck. [[01:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=5979.44s)]
*  From like. [[01:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=5980.88s)]
*  What a creature. [[01:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=5981.36s)]
*  You were a creature. [[01:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=5983.84s)]
*  I was. [[01:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=5985.04s)]
*  I crawled out of a swamp. [[01:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=5985.36s)]
*  And I had a bit. [[01:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=5987.04s)]
*  I had life so good at Muir. [[01:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=5988.32s)]
*  Like girls liked me. [[01:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=5990.24s)]
*  I had a ton of friends. [[01:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=5991.28s)]
*  And then I just showed up at this other high school and I looked fucking nuts. [[01:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=5992.24s)]
*  In John Muir Junior High. [[01:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=5996.32s)]
*  Is it based on the John Muir Trail or no? [[01:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=5998.48s)]
*  That's the Redwoods guy. [[01:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=6002.16s)]
*  Isn't it the Muir? [[01:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=6004.48s)]
*  No, mine is Margaret E. Muir. [[01:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=6005.04s)]
*  I think we're confusing Muirs. [[01:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=6006.8s)]
*  My school is Margaret E. Muir in Milford, Michigan. [[01:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=6008.4s)]
*  Which I heard sadly they just closed down. [[01:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=6011.6s)]
*  You know, I've never wanted to go to a high school reunion, but I wanted. [[01:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=6013.52s)]
*  I got the idea last year. [[01:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=6017.6s)]
*  I'm like, I want to host a Junior High reunion because that was the sweet spot. [[01:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=6018.72s)]
*  Yeah, Junior High was, dude. [[01:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=6023.040000000001s)]
*  So fun. [[01:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=6024.88s)]
*  I had a spree. [[01:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=6025.92s)]
*  Do you remember sprees? [[01:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=6027.92s)]
*  Sprees the candies? [[01:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=6028.72s)]
*  No, this might be me being five years older. [[01:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=6029.76s)]
*  It was a moped, a Honda spree. [[01:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=6032.64s)]
*  And I lived like I lived miles away from my friends. [[01:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=6035.360000000001s)]
*  So it's like all of a sudden I had a spree. [[01:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=6038.0s)]
*  My dad bought it for me in a drunken stupor. [[01:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=6039.84s)]
*  I felt bad about some and bought it for me. [[01:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=6042.16s)]
*  And so there's a spree. [[01:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=6044.56s)]
*  My dad used to get us hot dogs all the time. [[01:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=6046.8s)]
*  That was his I'm sorrys. [[01:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=6049.04s)]
*  Sometimes you come home and there'd be like six hot dogs for you. [[01:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=6052.24s)]
*  Because he would get, he would drink too. [[01:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=6054.8s)]
*  He would drink and he would park his. [[01:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=6058.72s)]
*  He had like a thunderbird or something. [[01:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=6060.8s)]
*  He would park it in the ditch a lot of times outside of our house. [[01:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=6062.88s)]
*  And I think our mom actually dug the ditch so he would land in it. [[01:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=6065.92s)]
*  They were kind of at odds. [[01:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=6070.0s)]
*  But I had that black spree you saw with the very sexy purple riding. [[01:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=6071.28s)]
*  So I was like, I was mobile in seventh grade. [[01:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=6075.2s)]
*  I could go anywhere that one corner. [[01:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=6078.24s)]
*  Look how sexy that thing is. [[01:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=6080.0s)]
*  So I was by the way, that vanilla colored one's really good. [[01:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=6081.52s)]
*  That's beautiful. [[01:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=6084.56s)]
*  Now that I'm older and more mature, I would get you that. [[01:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=6085.2s)]
*  I would like that vanilla one. [[01:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=6087.6s)]
*  But I could ride everywhere. [[01:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=6089.28s)]
*  I had girlfriends. [[01:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=6090.96s)]
*  I could go to their houses while their parents were out at work. [[01:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=6092.0s)]
*  It was such a perfect time. [[01:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=6095.76s)]
*  Dude, I remember they had a girl that lived close enough to me. [[01:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=6098.56s)]
*  And I remember walking down there one time because [[01:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=6101.360000000001s)]
*  she would kind of sometimes let people touch her breasts or whatever. [[01:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=6104.56s)]
*  I think this is rural shit that people don't really relate to. [[01:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=6108.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=6112.56s)]
*  Yeah, she was all, she'd be like, hey, come over and touch my breast. [[01:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=6113.84s)]
*  There were a lot of girls like that in my time. [[01:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=6117.04s)]
*  And this girl was big, like big bone, like built like a tree almost. [[01:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=6118.8s)]
*  And so like you could run and hide behind her like that with a buddy. [[01:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=6123.200000000001s)]

*  But anyways, so I had this fantasy and I'm still best friends with my best friend who [[01:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=6166.24s)]
*  I met at Muir junior high in sixth grade, Aaron Winkley. [[01:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=6171.2s)]
*  And so we, both of us, that was the highlight of our life. [[01:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=6173.84s)]
*  He's a recovering addict too. [[01:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=6176.88s)]
*  We're, you know, we went hard together. [[01:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=6177.92s)]
*  He made it. [[01:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=6180.799999999999s)]
*  He stretched it out another 14 years. [[01:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=6181.84s)]
*  I don't know how he did it. [[01:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=6183.44s)]
*  Oh, but we wanted to throw this thing, but we had to consider like, certainly a lot of [[01:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=6184.32s)]
*  guys are going to want to kick our ass at this thing. [[01:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=6191.36s)]
*  Oh, the junior high thing. [[01:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=6193.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=6194.48s)]
*  From my town. [[01:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=6195.12s)]
*  There's certainly some dudes who are not thrilled that I grew up married Kristen Bell. [[01:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=6196.72s)]
*  Maybe I already, they wanted to kick my ass in junior high, but in a lot of dudes got [[01:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=6202.4s)]
*  enormous. [[01:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=6206.88s)]
*  A lot of guys went to prison. [[01:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=6207.5199999999995s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=6209.2s)]
*  Some people would really be upset, you think? [[01:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=6209.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=6211.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=6211.5199999999995s)]
*  I'm pretty certain of it. [[01:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=6211.68s)]
*  So then we were like, how are we going to have this thing and not have to fight? [[01:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=6212.96s)]
*  We don't want to do that, but it seems highly likely. [[01:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=6217.44s)]
*  Have you been to a high school reunion and did any guy get pissed? [[01:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=6221.2s)]
*  Yeah, I've been to stuff like that. [[01:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=6224.32s)]
*  We did a nice dinner recently. [[01:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=6225.52s)]
*  Yeah, there is something you just don't want people to feel that you're different than [[01:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=6227.2s)]
*  them, you know? [[01:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=6230.24s)]
*  That's one of like my biggest things is just like trying to make sure that like my buddies [[01:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=6231.28s)]
*  and stuff, as much as I can, don't feel like I, that I think I'm different than them. [[01:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=6235.28s)]
*  And they think you're better. [[01:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=6240.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=6241.44s)]
*  And to try to check my thoughts too and see what's going on with me so that I'm cognizant [[01:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=6241.759999999999s)]
*  of that. [[01:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=6248.0s)]
*  But my ego is like one of my biggest fears, you know? [[01:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=6248.5599999999995s)]
*  Because it grows. [[01:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=6251.28s)]
*  You don't even know it's growing. [[01:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=6252.08s)]
*  The next thing you know, you're just a complete asshole. [[01:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=6253.2s)]
*  Like I will be stressed out and be angry sometimes, but I don't know if I get into the ego space [[01:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=6255.28s)]
*  as much, but I get into the overwhelmed space a lot. [[01:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=6261.759999999999s)]
*  But yeah, I think a lot of my friends from where I'm from have been pretty stoked. [[01:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=6266.08s)]
*  About just podcasting the people we get to talk to and stuff like that. [[01:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=6271.5199999999995s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[01:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=6275.5199999999995s)]
*  So dude, I was thinking of you on Friday because I watched the Ric Flair doc. [[01:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=6276.16s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[01:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=6281.36s)]
*  The 30 for 30 on Ric Flair. [[01:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=6282.4s)]
*  And I was like, oh right, I remember you had them on. [[01:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=6284.08s)]
*  That was unbelievable. [[01:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=6286.719999999999s)]
*  Unreal. [[01:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=6288.0s)]
*  Just being able to, yeah, spend time with a piece of your own life like that. [[01:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=6288.96s)]
*  Like Michael Landon, I would love to spend time with, but he's dead. [[01:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=6293.5199999999995s)]
*  That's your dude, Michael Landon. [[01:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=6298.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=6299.36s)]
*  That's an interesting choice. [[01:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=6299.839999999999s)]
*  I love Michael Landon, dude. [[01:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=6301.44s)]
*  We loved him. [[01:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=6302.799999999999s)]
*  He was supposed to come to our town. [[01:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=6303.36s)]
*  He was supposed to come to the rodeo once, but he didn't show up or whatever. [[01:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=6304.48s)]
*  My mom was all pissed because she even went down there to see him. [[01:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=6308.639999999999s)]
*  She did. [[01:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=6311.36s)]
*  Okay. [[01:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=6314.32s)]
*  This is kind of psychological and you want to... [[01:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=6315.36s)]
*  Well, I think he was supposed to come. [[01:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=6319.679999999999s)]
*  What project did you fall in love with Michael Landon from? [[01:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=6322.0s)]
*  Highway to Heaven? [[01:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=6324.879999999999s)]
*  Both at the same time. [[01:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=6326.32s)]
*  Highway to Heaven with Victor French and then also with Victor French when he was on [[01:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=6327.599999999999s)]
*  Little House on the Prairie. [[01:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=6330.64s)]
*  I met Nellie Olson one time at Chaseback. [[01:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=6332.0s)]
*  What a fucking head of hair. [[01:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=6333.68s)]
*  My goodness. [[01:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=6335.200000000001s)]
*  Unbelievable. [[01:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=6336.08s)]
*  That's a mane. [[01:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=6336.160000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=6337.6s)]
*  You kind of... [[01:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=6337.84s)]
*  Do you think you're subconsciously trying to have the same hair? [[01:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=6339.68s)]
*  Maybe today I am a little bit. [[01:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=6343.200000000001s)]
*  The hair is fucking... [[01:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=6344.96s)]
*  My Lord. [[01:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=6346.72s)]
*  What I would have done with that hair. [[01:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=6348.72s)]
*  Oh, dude. [[01:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=6350.4800000000005s)]
*  I'm not even gay and I would have definitely kissed this dude. [[01:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=6351.200000000001s)]
*  That guy's beautiful. [[01:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=6354.64s)]
*  Bro, that dude's... [[01:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=6355.52s)]
*  I would have done whatever he wanted to do if he had let me just do this through the [[01:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=6356.08s)]
*  top of the hair. [[01:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=6360.56s)]
*  Bro. [[01:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=6361.52s)]
*  What's the price? [[01:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=6362.400000000001s)]
*  That dude's better looking than 80% of the girls I've ever dated. [[01:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=6363.04s)]
*  Which is crazy. [[01:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=6367.52s)]
*  Do you enjoy podcasting more now? [[01:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=6371.04s)]
*  What do you feel like for yourself? [[01:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=6373.120000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I didn't answer your question. [[01:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=6374.080000000001s)]
*  How free did you get when that started? [[01:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=6375.120000000001s)]
*  Like, were you... [[01:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=6376.64s)]
*  Because you started podcasting and a lot of people weren't doing it. [[01:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=6377.04s)]
*  Yeah, but I also felt late to it. [[01:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=6380.88s)]
*  There were. [[01:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=6383.4400000000005s)]
*  Marin was already there. [[01:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=6384.320000000001s)]
*  Chris Hardwick was already huge. [[01:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=6385.76s)]
*  I definitely felt like I'm a poser that I'm starting a podcast. [[01:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=6387.76s)]
*  We just had our six-year anniversary last week. [[01:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=6391.6s)]
*  Yeah, I think that's where we're about at. [[01:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=6394.0s)]
*  You're beyond that. [[01:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=6395.4400000000005s)]
*  I looked at you. [[01:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=6396.4800000000005s)]
*  You've been podcasting for like eight years. [[01:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=6397.200000000001s)]
*  Oh, wow. [[01:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=6398.88s)]
*  Minimally. [[01:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=6399.360000000001s)]
*  Jesus Christ. [[01:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=6400.96s)]
*  Yeah, so you're already doing it. [[01:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=6401.84s)]
*  I felt self-conscious like, oh, this is so embarrassing. [[01:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=6403.52s)]
*  I'm about to do this. [[01:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=6406.8s)]
*  Was it embarrassing in your acting world? [[01:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=6407.12s)]
*  Like, or in that Hollywood world? [[01:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=6408.88s)]
*  Did it feel like kind of a weird thing to do kind of? [[01:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=6410.08s)]
*  Sometimes, you know, people are always a little weary sometimes. [[01:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=6414.16s)]
*  I think they're less weary now, but people at the, I think, five or six years ago. [[01:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=6418.96s)]
*  Like it was below them. [[01:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=6423.12s)]
*  Yeah, just like, what am I doing? [[01:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=6424.48s)]
*  You know. [[01:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=6425.76s)]
*  I didn't have that fear. [[01:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=6426.24s)]
*  I had more of the fear of like, what does Marin think? [[01:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=6428.72s)]
*  What does Chris Hardwick think? [[01:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=6431.76s)]
*  Like the people who've already done it and proven, what does Rogan think? [[01:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=6433.04s)]
*  Like, this is embarrassing that I'm now trying to hop into this thing [[01:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=6437.04s)]
*  that they've all been doing for years. [[01:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=6440.72s)]
*  But weirdly, yeah, now people will act like I was somehow early. [[01:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=6443.12s)]
*  Because then, of course, there was a much bigger wave after we started. [[01:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=6446.4s)]
*  But I love it so much. [[01:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=6449.84s)]
*  I don't have any desire to act. [[01:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=6452.719999999999s)]
*  I haven't acted in a couple years, I guess, now. [[01:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=6454.719999999999s)]
*  I'm so fulfilled. [[01:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=6457.2s)]
*  I am on four shows a week and I produce six shows a week. [[01:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=6459.679999999999s)]
*  Oh, wow. [[01:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=6463.599999999999s)]
*  I didn't know you guys were doing all of that. [[01:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=6464.08s)]
*  Yeah, so it's very like. [[01:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=6465.92s)]
*  Good. [[01:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=6467.5199999999995s)]
*  Well, thank you so much for taking the time today, dude. [[01:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=6467.759999999999s)]
*  Oh, my God. [[01:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=6470.0s)]
*  I wanted to be on so bad. [[01:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=6471.360000000001s)]
*  That's awesome, man. [[01:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=6473.120000000001s)]
*  But it's I love it. [[01:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=6474.160000000001s)]
*  Do you love it? [[01:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=6475.200000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I love it. [[01:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=6476.320000000001s)]
*  I just love it. [[01:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=6477.200000000001s)]
*  I love wanting to learn more. [[01:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=6478.080000000001s)]
*  I love the scary part. [[01:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=6479.360000000001s)]
*  I think I've evolved as a human because of it, which is like, [[01:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=6481.76s)]
*  I was kind of happy where I was. [[01:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=6485.76s)]
*  I was working just fine. [[01:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=6488.64s)]
*  Yeah, I think I was enjoying myself. [[01:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=6489.76s)]
*  And it's like, I don't know if I've gotten like. [[01:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=6491.68s)]
*  I mean, I just learned you can't help but learning more from listening to people. [[01:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=6494.88s)]
*  You know? [[01:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=6498.0s)]
*  Well, I do. [[01:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=6498.8s)]
*  So Mondays on our show is celebrities and then Thursdays is experts. [[01:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=6499.52s)]
*  So like scientists and fucking, you know, startup people, you name it. [[01:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=6504.320000000001s)]
*  Bill Gates has been on. [[01:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=6510.8s)]
*  Well, who was last? [[01:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=6514.96s)]
*  You just saw I had that, you know, Pulitzer Prize winning author [[01:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=6515.84s)]
*  who's written this book on communication. [[01:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=6520.08s)]
*  So Thursdays is constantly someone really challenging. [[01:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=6522.88s)]
*  That's super duper smart. [[01:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=6526.72s)]
*  And yeah, I feel like I'm still at college, but I don't ever have to go to class. [[01:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=6528.5599999999995s)]
*  I don't have to write an exam paper. [[01:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=6532.24s)]
*  I just the smartest people in the world come. [[01:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=6533.839999999999s)]
*  Bill Gates has sat down and chatted with me, you know. [[01:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=6536.879999999999s)]
*  What was he like to because he gets such a rap. [[01:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=6539.5199999999995s)]
*  Like everybody thinks he's a like, he's like this lizard. [[01:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=6541.679999999999s)]
*  Just like he thinks that people think he has children in his basement [[01:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=6546.24s)]
*  and he's very, very clean. [[01:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=6550.48s)]
*  A Dino Chrome. [[01:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=6552.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=6553.28s)]
*  To stay young, right. [[01:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=6553.5199999999995s)]
*  Which is so comical because I've both interviewed him a couple of times. [[01:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=6555.04s)]
*  And if just look at him, it's not working. [[01:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=6558.16s)]
*  He's aging very expectedly. [[01:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=6560.88s)]
*  Like if Bill Gates looked 36, I could see where you would have that conspiracy theory. [[01:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=6563.84s)]
*  But he looks fucking his age. [[01:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=6569.6s)]
*  Wow. [[01:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=6572.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=6573.12s)]
*  Right. [[01:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=6573.68s)]
*  God bless him. [[01:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=6574.32s)]
*  He looks exactly how he should. [[01:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=6575.12s)]
*  I think I get worried when people have so much control. [[01:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=6577.5199999999995s)]
*  That's the one thing that I think about like wealth and stuff. [[01:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=6580.8s)]
*  I feel like they should put a cap on how much wealth and control somebody could have. [[01:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=6584.08s)]
*  Because here's what I wondered is if say if one person makes so much money, [[01:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=6588.4s)]
*  does that mean other people don't have that money to make? [[01:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=6592.32s)]
*  No. [[01:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=6594.88s)]
*  So that's I think a lot of people have this zero sum thought of how the economy works, [[01:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=6595.36s)]
*  but that's not the case. [[01:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=6600.719999999999s)]
*  People invent shit and grow the economy. [[01:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=6602.5599999999995s)]
*  So like my favorite biography I've ever read in my life, everyone should read it. [[01:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=6605.759999999999s)]
*  It's called Titan. [[01:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=6610.5599999999995s)]
*  It's about John D Rockefeller. [[01:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=6611.68s)]
*  And it's about him building standard oil. [[01:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=6613.84s)]
*  And so this dude, John D Rockefeller, when he became 100 millionaires, that had never existed. [[01:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=6616.4800000000005s)]
*  The economy was so small at that point that I think they say that out of every dollar that existed [[01:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=6623.6s)]
*  in America, he had like 50 cents of it. [[01:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=6630.400000000001s)]
*  So all these inventions, all these products, they all just swell it. [[01:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=6634.16s)]
*  So it's kind of has an infinite ceiling. [[01:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=6638.4s)]
*  But I think people think of it as like we're at a ceiling and they got this. [[01:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=6642.0s)]
*  But that's not actually our GDP swells and swells and swells and everyone has. [[01:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=6645.759999999999s)]
*  But John D Rockefeller took all that money. [[01:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=6650.639999999999s)]
*  And he started he mid career like in his 40s. [[01:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=6654.799999999999s)]
*  He's like, I want to solve everything now. [[01:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=6659.12s)]
*  The South, what's going on in the South? [[01:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=6661.2s)]
*  Oh, people think Southerners are lazy. [[01:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=6663.36s)]
*  Why do they think they're lazy? [[01:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=6665.92s)]
*  He deploys a team of scientists. [[01:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=6667.84s)]
*  They figure out, oh, like 40 percent of the people in the South have hookworm from walking barefoot. [[01:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=6670.4s)]
*  When hookworm gets in your body, it overtakes your intestines, it saps all your energy. [[01:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=6675.599999999999s)]
*  They have no energy because they're not taking in the nutrients from their food. [[01:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=6679.84s)]
*  He's like, we got to eradicate hookworm from the South. [[01:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=6683.04s)]
*  Worms are stealing the vitamins? [[01:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=6685.28s)]
*  Just this growth inside your intestines prevented the nutrients from absorbing. [[01:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=6687.04s)]
*  So he sends out a team of people to educate everyone in the South to A, wear shoes. [[01:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=6691.5199999999995s)]
*  And then there's a very simple cure for it, which is like, I think, an iodine regiment. [[01:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=6696.16s)]
*  So he also sets up free iodine regiment to get rid of. [[01:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=6701.28s)]
*  He eradicates hookworm. [[01:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=6704.48s)]
*  There was no such thing as research science before John D Rockefeller. [[01:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=6706.24s)]
*  He's like, all we have is these doctors. [[01:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=6710.72s)]
*  They graduate from all these different schools. [[01:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=6712.48s)]
*  No one knows what degree is what. [[01:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=6714.48s)]
*  There's no standard. [[01:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=6716.32s)]
*  And then he said, well, what's the best medical facility in the world? [[01:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=6718.16s)]
*  It's Johns Hopkins Hospital. [[01:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=6723.28s)]
*  He paid them to come up with a curriculum. [[01:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=6725.76s)]
*  And then he went to every medical school in America and said, I will pay you if you adopt [[01:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=6727.6s)]
*  this curriculum so that our doctors all have a standard level. [[01:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=6731.68s)]
*  Wow. [[01:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=6735.4400000000005s)]
*  Attitude. [[01:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=6735.68s)]
*  So he created that. [[01:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=6736.400000000001s)]
*  And then he created medical research that didn't exist where scientists are in a lab, [[01:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=6737.6s)]
*  actually studying pathogens and coming up with. [[01:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=6742.4800000000005s)]
*  So he spent his whole life. [[01:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=6745.68s)]
*  He, he, at the point that he died, he had probably saved more Americans than any other human being. [[01:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=6747.84s)]
*  Bill Gates is Rockefeller. [[01:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=6754.8s)]
*  You should watch the doc Bill's brain on Netflix. [[01:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=6756.64s)]
*  He might have autism or something. [[01:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=6760.24s)]
*  Does it seem like maybe that seems like he probably has some divergent. [[01:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=6761.52s)]
*  My friend said he has it. [[01:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=6765.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=6766.72s)]
*  But I'm not qualified to diagnose it, but my guess is he's probably on some [[01:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=6767.4400000000005s)]
*  spectrum of some neurodivergent. [[01:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=6772.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=6774.400000000001s)]
*  Now, what is that? [[01:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=6774.8s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=6775.6s)]
*  Well, and a lot of people are now some of the greatest. [[01:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=6776.08s)]
*  It's almost like where we're heading as a species is people that have some form of [[01:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=6777.92s)]
*  autism are now able to capitulate or something or conceptualize the next thing that we need [[01:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=6781.92s)]
*  as a society or something that we, the rest of us can't do. [[01:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=6789.28s)]
*  It's almost crazy how something that 20 years ago was considered probably more of a deficit [[01:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=6792.32s)]
*  is now considered like, if this got to have a little bit of autism, we're not letting him [[01:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=6797.76s)]
*  near the counter. [[01:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=6801.76s)]
*  You know? [[01:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=6802.72s)]
*  Well, I just, my guest I interviewed last Friday, it hasn't aired yet, but she is a [[01:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=6803.6s)]
*  neurodivergent expert. [[01:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=6807.76s)]
*  She herself is neurodivergent, which was a really interesting interview because I've [[01:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=6809.28s)]
*  never really interviewed someone that was just very open about that. [[01:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=6813.44s)]
*  What does it mean neurodivergent? [[01:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=6816.88s)]
*  So that could be dyslexia, ADHD, autism, hyperlexia. [[01:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=6818.4s)]
*  There's a bunch of things that would, it just means that you're not quote the normal, [[01:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=6824.96s)]
*  but one in five people in America is neurodivergent. [[01:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=6831.2s)]
*  Really? [[01:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=6835.44s)]
*  So 20% of us are. [[01:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=6835.759999999999s)]
*  I am because I'm dyslexic. [[01:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=6838.32s)]
*  So I qualify for that. [[01:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=6839.839999999999s)]
*  But yes, she was saying the things that a lot of neurodivergent people add to a company [[01:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=6841.759999999999s)]
*  is like, they don't fall for group thinking. [[01:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=6847.04s)]
*  I see what's going on. [[01:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=6851.759999999999s)]
*  They're like, they don't mind pointing out that no, no, that's actually not right. [[01:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=6852.96s)]
*  There's like some helpful disagreeability that they just, they don't get along. [[01:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=6857.28s)]
*  They don't, they've been so on the outside growing up. [[01:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=6862.5599999999995s)]
*  They're so used to that dynamic of feeling awkward and people not, you know, [[01:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=6865.04s)]
*  embracing them that like for them to point out the clear obvious thing in the room is no problem. [[01:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=6869.76s)]
*  It's easy for them. [[01:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMZaQr9mPk&t=6875.2s)]
