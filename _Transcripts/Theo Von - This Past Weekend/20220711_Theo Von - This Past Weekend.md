*  And, uh, I'm grateful that he's back, uh, catching up with him here at the [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=39.44s)]
*  Hollywood casino in Florida. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=43.84s)]
*  It's Dale D'Antoni, Jody Highroller, Mr. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=46.480000000000004s)]
*  Riff Raff. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=49.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=87.4s)]
*  It's always tough. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=87.96000000000001s)]
*  You got it. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=90.08s)]
*  It's like being at a rope swing. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=90.56s)]
*  You got to wait for somebody to kind of try it first, you know, [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=91.92s)]
*  especially when it's at silence out there and then, and everybody's watching. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=95.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=99.08s)]
*  Everybody's watching. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=100.08s)]
*  Now you're thinking from the outside point of view and you're looking at [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=100.88s)]
*  yourself and you're thinking too much. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=105.84s)]
*  And sometimes, you know, study long study wrong. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=108.28s)]
*  Oh, really? [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=114.32000000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=115.08s)]
*  Study long study wrong. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=115.36s)]
*  Sometimes overthink it. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=116.92s)]
*  Oh man. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=118.16s)]
*  Well, I, yeah. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=118.8s)]
*  And I've been doing some wrong. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=119.64s)]
*  I've done some wrong. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=121.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=122.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=122.8s)]
*  So sometimes, cause, cause the first time if I'm hearing a song of mine or [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=123.48s)]
*  something and like I sometimes don't even listen to the beats until I don't, [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=128.16s)]
*  I like if I hear a snippet or something, I'm like, Oh, I like that. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=132.28s)]
*  Then I'm going to go, I'm going to hit pause and just leave it. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=134.92s)]
*  Cause I don't want to hear it too many times. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=137.36s)]
*  Cause I'm going to forget the energy that I had, you know, it makes you keep [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=138.8s)]
*  listening to it. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=143.0s)]
*  So it's like, hold on. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=143.68s)]
*  Let me just get that. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=144.68s)]
*  Cause it, once it becomes work, you lose interest. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=145.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=149.72s)]
*  Wow. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=150.24s)]
*  So why is that? [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=151.72s)]
*  I wonder, you know, why? [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=152.96s)]
*  I guess, I guess a lot, if so a lot's riding on something, but if a lot of [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=156.28s)]
*  ain't riding on it, you know what I mean? [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=160.04000000000002s)]
*  I guess if it's like, you're trying to time a, a jump or something and there's [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=161.52s)]
*  trains passing by and you're trying to time it right where it's like, okay, [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=166.44s)]
*  that's you've got, you need to study for that. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=170.96s)]
*  Cause if you fuck up. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=173.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=175.04000000000002s)]
*  You might not make it, but I think if it's like a tire swing, depends if you, [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=175.4s)]
*  how much you like your ankles. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=182.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=184.48000000000002s)]
*  Your ankle, you know, it could be dangerous out there. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=185.36s)]
*  I'll tell you this, baby. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=189.36s)]
*  You're back, man. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=190.36s)]
*  I'm back. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=191.56s)]
*  It's been a while. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=192.24s)]
*  Three. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=193.44s)]
*  It's been three years. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=193.68s)]
*  I am. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=195.16s)]
*  Since I brought you mangoes, big mangoes. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=195.52s)]
*  God, they were good too. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=198.36s)]
*  Good mangoes. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=199.60000000000002s)]
*  And they felt good, man. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=200.56s)]
*  You know, Anna Nicole Smith died here. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=202.48000000000002s)]
*  In this hotel. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=204.84s)]
*  From what they said drugs. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=207.6s)]
*  I thought it was from being thick. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=212.16s)]
*  Okay. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=213.8s)]
*  Maybe she mixed too many. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=215.48000000000002s)]
*  It's always somebody mixes a upper with a downer or a downer with alcohol. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=217.48000000000002s)]
*  And they fall asleep. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=227.4s)]
*  Don't wake up. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=228.08s)]
*  Or somebody put something else in the upper. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=229.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=235.4s)]
*  Made them go down. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=235.88s)]
*  Hmm. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=237.04s)]
*  That's just gotta be a dark surprise. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=238.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=240.24s)]
*  I don't like that kind of stuff, man. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=240.4s)]
*  A lot of stuff out there. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=241.56s)]
*  Now they got, I mean, everything has something in it. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=242.64000000000001s)]
*  You can't get that real clean, uh, drugs like you used to. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=245.28s)]
*  And I can't use, I don't use them anymore because that's one of the reasons they [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=249.44s)]
*  quit making good stuff. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=252.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=254.28s)]
*  They put fentanyl and everything. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=254.44s)]
*  It's, but I mean, you don't know what's in it just because white powder might be [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=255.6s)]
*  sheetrock and fentanyl people like, people don't have any. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=258.36s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=264.12s)]
*  Like it used to be, I mean, the way I see it in the eighties when it was [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=264.92s)]
*  cocaine blowing up from blowing in, I mean, a strong wind would just [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=269.76s)]
*  dust your stepmother over. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=274.44s)]
*  That shit was good from Columbia or wherever. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=275.8s)]
*  And it's, and it's, and it was good. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=279.24s)]
*  And now there's, and you want, and you would have repeat customers because it's [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=282.28000000000003s)]
*  the best, the cream of the crop. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=287.16s)]
*  But the, although when somebody say cocaine, then it's all there was was [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=289.48s)]
*  cocaine, there was no fake of that because this is what it is. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=294.28000000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=298.6s)]
*  You know? [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=299.44s)]
*  So then as time passes, then everybody gets spread out, the population growing. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=299.92s)]
*  Then you have people selling a fake version of it because they're just in and [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=304.64s)]
*  out of town, they're just trying to make their little money. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=308.24s)]
*  And they don't care if they kill somebody or not, because it doesn't, [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=309.8s)]
*  they don't know anybody there. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=312.68s)]
*  It don't, they don't care. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=313.76s)]
*  They don't have to take pride in their work. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=315.91999999999996s)]
*  Right. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=317.56s)]
*  That's a shame, man. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=318.35999999999996s)]
*  I remember people used to take pride in the work. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=319.28s)]
*  I feel like no matter what it was. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=321.08s)]
*  Yeah, man. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=324.76s)]
*  I don't know what killed Anna Nicole. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=325.15999999999997s)]
*  I think he had drugs and, uh, I don't know. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=326.64s)]
*  You believe in ghosts? [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=333.76s)]
*  Yeah, definitely. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=334.84s)]
*  Oh damn. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=335.64s)]
*  But it makes me sad to think that ghosts would still be on earth because if you [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=336.32s)]
*  were here and you don't go on to somewhere better and you're trapped here, how long [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=341.64s)]
*  can you end up other ghosts are there and you hear about people being like, uh, [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=346.96s)]
*  ghosts in a house or haunted house. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=351.28s)]
*  And if they're trapped in that house, yeah, are they by the, are they, is it a, [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=353.08s)]
*  if, is it only bad spirits? [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=357.64s)]

*  I like, I like the thing. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=493.16s)]
*  Be honest, bro. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=494.72s)]
*  Okay. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=495.48s)]
*  So I like to think that, you know how like Steve Jobs made an iPhone, right? [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=496.28000000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=501.56s)]
*  In that iPhone, there's not anything that's in that iPhone that he doesn't know it [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=502.4s)]
*  exists. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=507.96s)]
*  He put that camera there. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=508.36s)]
*  He put the, the, when you hit one, it goes to one. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=509.84000000000003s)]
*  It's a touch screen. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=512.12s)]
*  It's this, that, like every aspect of that. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=512.84s)]
*  So as a, if you're a, you are using that phone or if you're the phone, those things [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=514.92s)]
*  were instilled in you by the Steve Jobs, right? [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=520.92s)]
*  So if I look at a body's like iPhone, if you're feeling sad, you're feeling things [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=524.72s)]
*  you can't explain, you're feeling like you love someone, you're feeling like [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=529.5600000000001s)]
*  whatever you're feeling or your thoughts or something happens or your, whatever it [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=533.84s)]
*  is that was instilling you, that chip was put in you. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=538.08s)]
*  So for that, for it to feel sad or compassionate, you see a puppy and you're [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=542.16s)]
*  like, Oh, I want to hold it. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=545.84s)]
*  I want to, you know, loving someone or doing something that, you know, there's no [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=546.64s)]
*  cameras on, you're doing something good. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=549.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=551.96s)]
*  And you're doing all these things. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=552.24s)]
*  I think those are instilled in us, you know, like whistling, doing something [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=553.88s)]
*  joyful, you mean? [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=560.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=561.72s)]
*  Just happiness, joy. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=562.2s)]
*  When babies are born, they aren't born mean. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=563.28s)]
*  They're born into, you know, they're innocent. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=566.12s)]
*  And most kids are more compassionate than adults because they haven't been [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=568.48s)]
*  through all the, all the go-aheads, all the emotions that they feel. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=573.0s)]
*  So I think that all those things that are instilled in us, that it didn't come from [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=577.12s)]
*  us, somebody had to install that in us. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=584.2s)]
*  So you got to go somewhere good. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=588.4000000000001s)]
*  There got to be something better than what we're doing here. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=590.36s)]
*  That's, and sometimes that's all I got to keep going. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=595.4000000000001s)]
*  Amen. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=598.04s)]
*  I feel that man. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=599.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=601.56s)]
*  Sometimes I'm like, yeah, then that hope, that excitement, that there's something [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=601.88s)]
*  better going on, if I keep that in my head and in my heart, then that even helps me [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=609.4399999999999s)]
*  behave better towards people too. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=615.0799999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=617.28s)]
*  You know, cause that's my tough thing. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=617.8s)]
*  Sometimes I just get, man, I get, I get a lot of hidden anger comes out of me, you [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=619.8399999999999s)]
*  know, damn, like I got a damn fucking raspberry gremlin living inside of me, [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=624.68s)]

*  And not washing the silverware, dog. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=634.16s)]
*  So now I got something inside of me that just like wants to get out, you know, [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=635.92s)]
*  anxiety, anger, frustration. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=640.9599999999999s)]
*  Sometimes of doing, I'm doing this, this, this, this, all these things. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=643.52s)]
*  And, you know, and then sometimes people smoke a little weed or something and [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=648.0799999999999s)]
*  that takes the edge off. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=653.72s)]
*  And they, and then as you get older, you realize, okay, maybe that, you know, maybe [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=654.64s)]
*  that's why Mike Tyson smokes so much. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=657.5600000000001s)]
*  It keeps him cool. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=659.0s)]
*  And that works for him. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=660.24s)]
*  You know, some people, they take the, take the edge off. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=661.04s)]
*  And some people have a couple of drinks and then some people, if they're already [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=664.48s)]
*  an angry person, then when they drink, then that side of them comes out. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=668.32s)]
*  And that's when it's, you know, dangerous. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=672.6s)]
*  So they end up, people end up in jail, domestic, whatever the case is. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=674.32s)]
*  But it's like, I think like trying to like noticing I'm getting angry. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=678.04s)]
*  And then also like how we were talking about a little earlier, where it's like [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=684.4799999999999s)]

*  Just a little, you'd have to have it with something. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=1162.32s)]
*  I'm saying if I think if you were, something is wrong with you. [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=1164.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=1169.2s)]

*  I don't, I don't think I would. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=1172.64s)]
*  Maybe like melt some like vanilla bean, blue bell ice cream. [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=1174.16s)]
*  And you got a shot of that. [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=1177.52s)]

*  bill again, you know, I think it would overlap it. [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=1184.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=1190.24s)]
*  I think, yeah, you'd have to manage it well. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=1190.48s)]
*  Cause I don't know if you could tell your neighbors and shit about it. [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=1192.0s)]
*  I just, I don't want to be doing, I don't like to do things in secret. [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=1194.48s)]
*  That's what hurts me. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=1198.52s)]
*  I think. [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=1199.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=1201.1599999999999s)]
*  I, yeah, I try to, I try not to ever lie because man, eventually you just like, [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=1201.56s)]
*  it'll become a problem for you. [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=1207.24s)]
*  And if you have a lot of somebody, remember that I lied. [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=1208.96s)]
*  If you have a lot of somebody that you, you're around all the time or you want [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=1211.52s)]
*  to be around, then it's good. [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=1217.8s)]
*  All it's going to do is just, you're going to have a relationship with that lie. [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=1221.52s)]
*  Right. [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=1226.24s)]
*  Then you live in right next to your live. [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=1226.52s)]
*  You don't want to have that. [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=1228.32s)]
*  So you want to just be honest. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=1229.04s)]
*  And then if you got a lot of somebody, maybe you just keep them out of your [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=1230.1200000000001s)]
*  life so you don't get a lot of them. [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=1235.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=1237.2s)]
*  Tell two or three lies to them and tell them to fucking hit the road. [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=1237.52s)]
*  Does anybody ever recognize you? [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=1240.44s)]
*  And then you, you tell them, they say, Hey, are you the Yvonne? [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=1241.72s)]
*  And then you're like, nah, man. [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=1244.8400000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=1247.0s)]
*  Sometimes, man, the other day I was at the airport and I wasn't doing that good. [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=1247.28s)]
*  They shut down all the food places, you know? [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=1251.3200000000002s)]
*  So I was trying to fucking make something out of just a couple items at the little [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=1253.3200000000002s)]
*  quick stop and they don't have a lot of good items. [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=1256.76s)]
*  You know, they, I had commandeered a couple of Lunchables out of there. [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=1259.64s)]
*  And so at least I had a couple, you know, some protein options. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=1263.0s)]
*  I was the closest thing to a, you know, a real entree in the whole joint. [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=1265.76s)]
*  So I had me two Lunchables and I'm kind of putting something together. [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=1271.16s)]
*  I was trying to do it in secrecy. [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=1273.84s)]
*  I got to like a gate that didn't have anybody at it. [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=1275.08s)]
*  So I'm over there, got me a little plate run. [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=1278.4s)]
*  Things already been delayed three or four hours. [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=1280.4s)]
*  I'm sitting over there, stacking my stuff up. [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=1282.04s)]
*  Got an extra thing of string cheese and I broke that down, you know, into, you [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=1285.52s)]
*  know, you know, similar looking pieces. [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=1290.84s)]
*  And I kind of put myself to hold together a little bitty sandwich. [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=1293.92s)]
*  And this dude came up and man, I just, I think I felt ashamed of myself for being, [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=1297.64s)]
*  you know, sitting on the air, Florida airport. [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=1302.92s)]
*  I mean, you're just trying to chill. [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=1305.68s)]
*  Yeah, I know. [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=1307.4s)]
*  There's something about a man, like an adult fucking with two Lunchables open, [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=1308.04s)]
*  no children around this shit. [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=1311.96s)]

*  And then he said, are you Theo Varn? [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=1316.8400000000001s)]

*  They know that something is wrong. [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=2329.24s)]

*  You know, I believe that, you know, I don't think even like [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=2351.36s)]

*  So therapy could be. [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=2388.7200000000003s)]

*  based on how it went. [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=2429.12s)]

*  or wherever, and you know, it's a fun time. [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=2636.32s)]
*  Oh, yeah. I remember last time you told us about living with Simon when you first [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=2638.36s)]
*  when you first moved out there with him. Yeah. [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=2640.76s)]
*  But I think eventually you get to a point where you're like, well, [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=2642.48s)]
*  I've lived with my friends before. [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=2647.48s)]
*  Like, you know, I think when you're about like 30. [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=2649.2400000000002s)]
*  It's time to be like, oh, when I go home or I got my [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=2652.68s)]
*  woman at home, you know, because I think just eventually you [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=2656.44s)]
*  even if you got your friends and you all go do whatever, like eventually [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=2660.52s)]
*  you're going to get tired of. [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=2663.64s)]
*  Doing everything yourself. [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=2666.56s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, yeah, it gets lonesome. [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=2668.4s)]
*  Boring, lonesome. [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=2672.12s)]
*  You start thinking too much, being less productive. [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=2673.76s)]
*  You know, yeah, I even got me one of them dang body pillows one time, bro. [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=2677.44s)]
*  Full body, it's like supposed to be like not a woman, but [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=2681.2400000000002s)]
*  they say you could put perfume or whatever on it. Yeah. [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=2684.7999999999997s)]
*  Pretty much. But but it can't just be anybody. [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=2687.9199999999996s)]
*  No, because because that that, you know, goes back to the energy thing. [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=2690.8399999999997s)]
*  Like if you are. [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=2693.8399999999997s)]
*  Yeah, you got to be something, you know, and then that's where [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=2696.48s)]
*  it's like, all right, like this is something that I'm going to have to. [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=2700.0s)]
*  You know. Organize not what's the word [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=2705.56s)]
*  like that, the thought of like having a child in your mind, [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=2710.08s)]
*  it's getting close to that time, you know, or if you're getting out of shape, [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=2713.68s)]
*  it's like I'm going to have to hit the gym pretty soon. [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=2716.96s)]
*  You know what I mean? Right. [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=2719.2s)]
*  It's a little bit of that same thing almost like there's something inside of [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=2720.16s)]
*  you that says, man, something. [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=2722.72s)]
*  Yeah, like I come home and I have a sandwich or I make me a taco. [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=2724.6s)]
*  Yeah, I make tacos probably five nights a week. [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=2728.08s)]
*  OK, I'll make tacos, too. [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=2731.08s)]
*  I make some mean day a day and Tony tacos. [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=2732.48s)]
*  I got to make you some. [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=2735.7599999999998s)]
*  Yeah, I would have some out on the Ponderosa, baby. [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=2736.68s)]
*  Get out there and fill my damn holes with them. [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=2739.2s)]
*  But I'll say this, man. [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=2742.2s)]
*  Fill my holes with them. [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=2744.16s)]
*  Oh, bro. Oh, if I do it, I fucking love tacos so much, bro. [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=2745.56s)]
*  If I could, bro, if I had taste buds in my colon, I'd put one in my. [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=2749.12s)]
*  OK, well, you know, it's one way to do it. [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=2752.3199999999997s)]
*  And then there's other ways. [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=2755.04s)]
*  There's one of them. [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=2755.92s)]
*  I'm just saying, bro. Yeah, I want that, you know, I want to see what. [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=2756.68s)]
*  Yeah. Now, don't supersize it, though. [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=2760.3599999999997s)]
*  That's for sure. I want that regular size. [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=2762.6s)]
*  Yeah. With that baby talk. [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=2764.56s)]
*  Um, but yeah, man, I think about that because that's always been spooky to me, bro. [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=2766.72s)]
*  Is trying to thinking about having a kid. [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=2771.72s)]
*  Just a shit always scared me getting married. [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=2773.68s)]
*  Yeah. You ever been married? Never. [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=2776.24s)]
*  Damn, bro. And me neither, bro. [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=2778.52s)]
*  Yeah. I think Simon either. [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=2781.0s)]
*  There's a few like mutual claims of friends that never it's it's it's. [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=2783.0s)]
*  And he's he's just now he's having like he's not at his prime yet. [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=2789.2s)]
*  I don't think he's you know, he keeps remaking his every time when I talk to him. [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=2793.16s)]
*  I'm like, you know, like naked gun, 33 and a third. [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=2797.48s)]
*  Like I could see him being that and then finally blowing up Steve Martin. [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=2800.88s)]
*  Like you all you remember him. [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=2803.96s)]
*  He had the only time I saw Steve Martin when he had white hair. Yeah. [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=2805.1200000000003s)]
*  So when he was in three amigos and high or high school, anything, [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=2809.28s)]
*  what was the one where he was the one where it's like he was the dad? [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=2813.44s)]
*  Oh, oh, I know you're talking about Father of the Bride. [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=2816.44s)]
*  It was it was meet the parents before meet the parents. [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=2819.96s)]
*  Oh, my girl. Both of those. [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=2822.52s)]
*  He was great, bro. Yeah, he's he's he's still in my favorite movie. [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=2826.2400000000002s)]
*  Above the Rim. No. [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=2831.28s)]
*  Oh, that's your favorite movie. [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=2833.48s)]
*  Well, we know that probably he was in Clash of the Titans. [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=2835.5600000000004s)]
*  No, the one where he's the the preacher, the traveling preacher. [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=2839.52s)]
*  Do you ever see that? [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=2843.48s)]
*  I watch it. God, bro. [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=2844.5600000000004s)]
*  What's it called? It's called a. [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=2846.32s)]
*  I think snake something snake something. [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=2850.0800000000004s)]
*  Let me think. [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=2854.0400000000004s)]
*  Dang, bro. We'll look that up. [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=2855.0400000000004s)]
*  It have like a picture of him on the front of the thing. [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=2857.6s)]
*  Yeah, we're not with with with kids. [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=2861.84s)]
*  That that gives me anxiety because I know how like [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=2864.0s)]
*  cautious and like how much I care about my pups. [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=2868.12s)]
*  So like with a with a kid, I know, I know. [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=2873.6s)]
*  And the more I like hear about like people having kids and that are like [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=2877.08s)]
*  they keep their homeschooling and stuff because they don't want them [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=2883.08s)]
*  going out into what's in the world right now. [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=2885.48s)]
*  Like, you know, that's like it's just out of control. [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=2887.8s)]
*  I mean, and again, there could be a million schools and then one bad thing happens. [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=2892.84s)]
*  That's going to be all over the news. [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=2896.6s)]
*  I understand that news that is low, but I don't even want that percentage. [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=2897.84s)]
*  And I think in the first 10 years of a child's life, it's almost like a. [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=2901.32s)]
*  Hard drive or a SIM card, a SIM card, you know, gets full, [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=2908.44s)]
*  right, like a SIM card that you're taking pictures. [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=2913.08s)]
*  So you're downloading your or an iPod. [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=2915.32s)]
*  You're downloading all this information for the first 10 years. [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=2917.48s)]
*  And then after 10 years, unplug it. [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=2920.08s)]
*  And now you're using that information. [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=2922.12s)]
*  Are you playing the songs? [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=2923.68s)]
*  And you could. Or and it's updating your apps and your but you're you're uploading. [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=2924.6s)]
*  You're getting those those initial things that are like the basis of your entire life. [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=2928.4s)]
*  I remember shit from when I was between one and 10 more than I remember shit from [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=2934.6s)]
*  when I was 20, 30. Yeah. [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=2939.28s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? And we still probably live off of those. [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=2941.0s)]
*  I live off those old operating system. [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=2944.44s)]
*  You know what I mean? You know? [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=2946.2400000000002s)]
*  So so I would want my kid. [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=2947.28s)]
*  I would want to be right there. [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=2949.6000000000004s)]
*  Definitely for the first 10 years. [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=2950.8s)]
*  Make sure they're protected. [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=2953.0800000000004s)]
*  You know, put tennis balls on the edges of all corners and. [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=2954.2400000000002s)]
*  Yeah. No one's busting their face open. [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=2957.36s)]
*  And you got to be there because that's when kids are going to remember either. [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=2959.48s)]
*  My dad loves me and my parents love me. [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=2965.52s)]
*  And it's not even going to it's going to be subliminally already instilled in them. [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=2968.32s)]
*  They're going to have so much confidence [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=2971.04s)]
*  that my parents got my back. [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=2972.96s)]
*  My dad always got my back. Let's go play this. [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=2974.64s)]
*  Let's go do this. I can call my dad. [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=2976.44s)]
*  Then they get into that pattern of doing that, where if you weren't there, [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=2978.04s)]
*  then that in first 10 years, if you weren't there every day, [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=2981.36s)]
*  it doesn't matter if you owe. [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=2984.36s)]
*  They're not going to understand like, oh, he was working. [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=2985.84s)]
*  He was one paying for this. [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=2987.68s)]
*  If you aren't there that day, all they remember is that they didn't have [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=2988.76s)]
*  a close relationship with you and it's not going to get closer. [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=2991.8s)]
*  So I think that first 10 years, you got to be right there. [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=2995.32s)]
*  Like I see how like Cal, DJ Khaled loves his kids. [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=2998.28s)]
*  I can't see them going to no public school. [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=3001.92s)]
*  Do you have if you want to teach them something, they come. [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=3003.52s)]
*  They come to the house. [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=3006.52s)]
*  I have a tutor. [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=3007.44s)]
*  Someone's built a little school in his house. [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=3008.12s)]
*  Or they learn maybe learning a different language, maybe learning math, [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=3009.6800000000003s)]
*  maybe learning whatever. [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=3012.96s)]
*  But I think being around a kid, being around their parents is important. [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=3013.7200000000003s)]

*  But that's funny, bro. [[01:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=3799.56s)]
*  Yeah, I don't like having someone having control over my outcome. [[01:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=3800.56s)]
*  I'd like to be the one that has determines what happens to me. [[01:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=3804.16s)]
*  I think that's why a lot of people end up like leaving a job [[01:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=3809.7599999999998s)]
*  that was paying a lot of money, but they had somebody telling them [[01:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=3812.96s)]
*  what to do 24 7 or having too much power over them. [[01:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=3815.88s)]
*  And they're under their thumb and they're. [[01:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=3821.24s)]
*  Dictating their life. [[01:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=3825.2s)]
*  That's not good for anybody. [[01:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=3827.2s)]
*  If you could go back, would you do it any different? [[01:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=3829.8799999999997s)]
*  Because sometimes I think that I end up damaging myself [[01:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=3831.7999999999997s)]
*  by being that way a little, you know, it helps me and it hurts me. [[01:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=3835.3199999999997s)]
*  The only the main thing if I did, I think I'm right where I'm supposed to be now. [[01:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=3839.12s)]
*  You know, I mean, I would rather be nowhere else. [[01:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=3843.7999999999997s)]
*  I think maybe. But I. [[01:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=3846.48s)]
*  But one thing that the one the one thing I do different in the past is. [[01:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=3849.0s)]
*  I was on Diplo's label. [[01:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=3857.24s)]
*  And I wanted to be more free. [[01:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=3859.3599999999997s)]
*  I wanted to do whatever I want, drop whatever I want. [[01:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=3862.3199999999997s)]
*  Now, looking back after Neon Icon, I should have stayed focused [[01:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=3864.44s)]
*  and been like, all right, we got to do another project that tops Neon Icon. [[01:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=3868.64s)]
*  And I can't drop another project till we top what we just did. Right. [[01:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=3872.3599999999997s)]
*  And what ended up happening is like, I kept doing what I do, dropping videos, [[01:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=3878.56s)]
*  songs, do whatever I want, whenever I want. Right. [[01:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=3883.44s)]
*  And in some and if I go back, I'll be I'll go stick with the script [[01:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=3885.7599999999998s)]
*  today that he had. We're still friends with still, you know, my brother works out. [[01:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=3891.16s)]
*  Yeah. You know, but that that that one thing and and spend more time with Jodie Husky [[01:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=3895.16s)]
*  and taking more places. Yeah. [[01:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=3901.8799999999997s)]
*  Probably those things stick out to me most that probably come across my mind. [[01:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=3904.24s)]
*  You know, things you might try different might try something different. [[01:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=3909.16s)]
*  Yeah. Just pop up in my brain just periodically throughout the week [[01:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=3911.7599999999998s)]
*  have popped up in my brain for the last. [[01:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=3914.8s)]
*  Years, you know, actually, like, oh, dude, yeah, like, I got shit like that. [[01:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=3918.2s)]
*  Yeah, I got a little skeletons that come by. [[01:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=3921.8s)]
*  What do you have anything that you would you were changing? [[01:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=3924.2s)]
*  Yeah, I think I would probably let I would trust other people more. [[01:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=3926.84s)]
*  I would trust like, you know, I never wanted to have a manager or anything like that. [[01:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=3932.0s)]
*  You know, I never really worked well with it. [[01:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=3937.08s)]
*  So I think there's times when I probably could do a little better [[01:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=3940.0s)]
*  if I trust other people and just believe, hey, maybe these people [[01:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=3942.92s)]
*  do have some of my best interests at heart. [[01:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=3947.16s)]
*  They're not just trying to get money or get up on me or something like that [[01:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=3949.76s)]
*  or, you know, or take advantage of me. [[01:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=3954.16s)]
*  I think it goes back to old scripts from when I was a kid, [[01:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=3956.56s)]
*  probably when I thought that somebody in a superior position, I didn't trust them. [[01:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=3959.28s)]
*  And so it's just old. [[01:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=3963.6800000000003s)]
*  It's just reading old newspapers sometimes, you know, so. [[01:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=3966.0s)]
*  Oh, I think you're you're on. [[01:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=3969.32s)]
*  No, I've I've even to this day had, you know, recent like [[01:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=3971.6800000000003s)]
*  gone through exactly what you're saying. [[01:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=3976.7200000000003s)]
*  Yeah. But what I've learned now, even within the last like a little bit of time is like, [[01:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=3978.6400000000003s)]
*  yeah, you're going to have to trust somebody, but you don't have to trust anybody. [[01:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=3984.36s)]
*  To with your money, like if it's a manager or whoever is going to help, then do that. [[01:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=3990.0800000000004s)]
*  But you don't need to be in control of my money, because then eventually [[01:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=3995.5600000000004s)]
*  that turn into power over your life. Oh, it's so if you you want to be able to trust [[01:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=3998.9599999999996s)]
*  your accountant. Right. Right. [[01:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=4002.52s)]
*  And luckily, I can trust mine. [[01:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=4005.08s)]
*  You know what I mean? Because everybody can't trust theirs. [[01:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=4007.0s)]
*  And that my account saved my life. Wow. Yeah. [[01:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=4008.8399999999997s)]
*  He told you, hey, you got to put the brakes on right here. [[01:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=4012.2799999999997s)]
*  He said he said, look at a riff I got to talk to you. [[01:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=4014.48s)]
*  Look at this, this, this, this. And I come over there. [[01:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=4019.48s)]
*  OK. You know what I mean? [[01:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=4023.52s)]
*  Because everybody ain't going to ain't going to show you [[01:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=4025.4399999999996s)]
*  because some people are going to be on the other side. [[01:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=4027.48s)]
*  You see the thing with Britney Spears, like she couldn't even pick her lawyers. [[01:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=4029.68s)]
*  So the lawyers are on the side with whoever is controlling her. [[01:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=4033.28s)]
*  Then then she has no hope. [[01:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=4036.48s)]
*  But if that lawyer said, you know what? You can do this, this, this. [[01:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=4038.8s)]
*  You don't got to do that. [[01:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=4041.2s)]
*  And now one person who could help that and fix all that. [[01:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=4042.2400000000002s)]
*  But if you got everybody playing against you, you're screwed. [[01:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=4045.4s)]
*  And it's tough, I bet, at her level, because you don't know who to trust then. [[01:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=4049.84s)]
*  And if you don't have power over your life. [[01:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=4053.52s)]
*  Then then you're basically just like a white, a white tiger in a cage. [[01:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=4056.08s)]
*  Go make the money. All right, you're done. Go back in here. [[01:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=4061.68s)]
*  Click. Yeah. Click. [[01:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=4064.16s)]
*  All right. Cut off light. She needs to rest. Oh, you need rest. [[01:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=4066.0s)]
*  Yeah. Cool. Let's go count this money. [[01:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=4068.48s)]
*  But they put you a little money in there with your food. [[01:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=4071.16s)]
*  Here's the money right here. Look, look, here's your money right here. [[01:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=4073.72s)]
*  And you a fucking tiger. You can't even spend no money. [[01:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=4075.48s)]
*  Yeah. You are going to buy some damn Frosted Flakes. [[01:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=4077.68s)]
*  Damn, bro. [[01:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=4080.56s)]
*  Before you go, if you did, if you did get into politics, [[01:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=4083.2s)]
*  that what you do you think about some of these gas prices, man? [[01:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=4087.84s)]
*  Honestly, bro. [[01:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=4090.32s)]
*  Could you do you think you could do something? [[01:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=4092.6s)]
*  Well, I heard we need a savior. [[01:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=4095.92s)]
*  I heard that the. [[01:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=4097.96s)]
*  And I forget where I heard this, or maybe I just saw it on Instagram, [[01:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=4100.08s)]
*  which again goes back to the rumors. [[01:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=4103.56s)]
*  Oh, yeah. Who is it? Who knows what? [[01:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=4105.56s)]
*  But I heard that the gas isn't disappearing. [[01:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=4107.6s)]
*  People can all they've been making the same process [[01:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=4110.4s)]
*  of like making the turn in whatever. [[01:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=4112.599999999999s)]
*  I don't know how it works. [[01:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=4115.04s)]
*  Drilling for oil or whatever or turning something into. [[01:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=4116.5199999999995s)]
*  You can make your own gas. [[01:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=4120.799999999999s)]
*  We had a guy bus that made his own gas, but it burned off a lot of his skin on his [[01:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=4122.0s)]
*  was his arms, maybe your legs. [[01:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=4127.4s)]
*  Yeah. Big arms. OK. And small legs. [[01:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=4129.759999999999s)]
*  So it's easy to singe those puppies. [[01:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=4132.08s)]
*  We're easy to get it confused to when you're looking at him. [[01:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=4134.5199999999995s)]
*  Who's doing handstand? [[01:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=4137.639999999999s)]
*  Dude. Well, bro, he had this one to Mr. [[01:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=4139.52s)]
*  Polito, bro. He fucking made his own gas, bro. [[01:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=4141.88s)]
*  And he actually died. [[01:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=4144.76s)]
*  They fucking threw him in a ditch fire, bro. [[01:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=4145.84s)]
*  Why? And he died. [[01:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=4148.12s)]
*  I don't know why. I didn't know him that good. [[01:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=4149.36s)]
*  I think there's other things probably that that could like [[01:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=4152.16s)]
*  you can't run off water, right? [[01:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=4157.0s)]
*  Well, they say you can't, but we don't have a lot of proof that you can't. [[01:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=4159.08s)]
*  I mean, I just feel like if if there was a way to, you know, [[01:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=4162.4400000000005s)]
*  you could do soul power energy for houses. [[01:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=4165.56s)]
*  Yeah. Put all them solar panels on. [[01:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=4167.68s)]
*  Why can't you do that for the cars? [[01:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=4169.56s)]
*  I agree. Or even if it's an old car, put the solar panels on [[01:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=4171.96s)]
*  and get a system cranked in there. And I. [[01:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=4176.04s)]
*  I feel like there's got to be a better way than gasoline. [[01:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=4179.72s)]
*  Gasoline is dangerous as fuck. [[01:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=4182.16s)]
*  I don't even like to cook with gas. [[01:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=4183.96s)]
*  If it goes tick, tick, tick, I'm open up all the windows. [[01:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=4186.240000000001s)]
*  I'm open up all the windows and I'm ordering McDonald's. [[01:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=4189.360000000001s)]
*  And I'm not even eating it. [[01:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=4192.4800000000005s)]
*  I'm just going to put it there. [[01:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=4193.320000000001s)]
*  On the table. Yeah, bro. [[01:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=4195.76s)]
*  Oh, I turn in a damn Bruce Willis every time they start that bitch. [[01:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=4197.68s)]
*  I turned in. Yeah, I back away. [[01:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XlQBSOyklM&t=4200.64s)]
