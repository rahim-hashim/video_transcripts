*  It's trying to transition folks. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=220.8s)]
*  It's trying to make more blacks and browns [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=223.88s)]

*  We're talking, well, that reminds me [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=289.54s)]
*  when I was in school and you had to build [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=295.0s)]
*  that solar system, baby. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=297.22s)]
*  Remember that? [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=298.7s)]
*  It was maybe third grade or fourth grade. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=300.56s)]
*  You had to build that solar system, which, [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=304.08000000000004s)]
*  like you had to make a mobile [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=306.58000000000004s)]
*  with the different planets hanging on it and that. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=308.26s)]
*  And the rich kids, they came, their mom, [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=311.86s)]
*  if you had a dad, first of all, [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=315.42s)]
*  then if your dad had a job and your mom didn't have to work, [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=318.26s)]
*  then your mom had a car with a hatchback, right? [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=321.74s)]
*  And the rich kids, Zachary or Abigail, [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=326.42s)]
*  they would come to the school and they had, [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=332.8s)]
*  their mom would open the hatchback [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=336.74s)]
*  and get their solar system out. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=340.54s)]
*  And you'd see all the planets on it [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=344.02s)]
*  made out of a little styrofoam ball and everything. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=345.86s)]
*  And oh, it's cute, it say their name on the side. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=349.1s)]
*  Zachary, Abigail. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=352.42s)]
*  Now, if you was over by us, bro, [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=356.62s)]
*  if you had to ride the poor bus, bro, [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=358.66s)]
*  you had to get your, first you had to build your shit, bro. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=360.5s)]
*  Mom wouldn't help, you ain't had no hot glue gun. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=364.34000000000003s)]
*  You was doing your thing, you had to do it yourself, right? [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=368.34000000000003s)]
*  That's how you had to do it. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=371.86s)]
*  I remember my solar system, [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=373.38s)]
*  that bitch had a orange in the middle, bro, [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=374.98s)]
*  and I put it in the microwave for like 30 seconds [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=377.86s)]
*  to warm it up, to give it that sun mentality, you know? [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=382.06s)]
*  So I heated that bit, put it in the middle, [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=386.26s)]
*  and then I hung whatever I could for the other thing, bro. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=389.82s)]
*  I had me a cherry tomato on there. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=393.1s)]
*  I had me a part of a mitten. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=395.66s)]
*  What else? [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=398.96000000000004s)]
*  I had a closings pin. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=399.8s)]
*  I had a butterscotch. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=402.22s)]
*  And what else was on mine? [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=404.38s)]
*  Maybe a marshmallow and a thing of tweezers [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=405.90000000000003s)]
*  that I had found in mom's room. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=408.70000000000005s)]
*  And that was my solar system, baby. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=410.90000000000003s)]
*  And you had to get on the bus, bro, that was the problem. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=413.26000000000005s)]
*  And on the bus, people, some people, [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=416.94s)]
*  they didn't have, theirs made, the other children. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=418.78000000000003s)]
*  So they had some lurkers on there. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=423.42s)]
*  Like Daniel, you know Daniel, [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=426.58000000000004s)]
*  he'd steal four Jupiters on the bus, bro. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=428.26000000000005s)]
*  He'd roll off the bus with a half a pocket [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=430.86s)]
*  full of Jupiters, dog. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=432.82000000000005s)]
*  And that was his presentation. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=434.8s)]
*  And Gerald, damn, I remember, oh man. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=438.82000000000005s)]
*  We had this one fella in our class, Gerald, bro, [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=443.32000000000005s)]
*  and he, you know, he didn't have a lot of brain in him. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=447.90000000000003s)]
*  He wasn't real, he wasn't that real, [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=451.32s)]
*  that brain dog, you know? [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=453.8s)]
*  And he had, his solar system had, [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=456.64s)]
*  I remember it had Earth and Alaska. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=459.52s)]
*  That was the two planets, bro. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=462.54s)]
*  That bitch had Earth and Alaska. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=465.12s)]
*  And one night, I remember we was at a camp out or something, [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=469.96s)]
*  I remember looking up at the sky with him [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=472.88s)]
*  and he, we were looking at the moon and he said, [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=474.76s)]
*  hey man, you think, you think we'll ever land on Alaska? [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=478.6s)]
*  And I just patted him on the back a little extra. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=486.24s)]
*  You know, cause sometimes some folk [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=490.36s)]
*  need that extra patting, bro. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=491.92s)]
*  And that's what he needed, a couple extra pats [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=494.86s)]
*  on the back, baby, but that's what God's doing, man. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=498.52000000000004s)]
*  What I'm saying is we all have different universes. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=503.02000000000004s)]

*  Got a lot of great calls. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=561.78s)]
*  What else? [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=565.34s)]
*  I've been feeling a lot, man. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=566.18s)]
*  I've been having a tough, I've been feeling [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=567.9399999999999s)]
*  like everything's gotta be perfect, man. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=569.98s)]
*  I've been feeling like, you know, it's like I come to, [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=574.98s)]
*  even just coming to podcasts, like I feel, [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=576.98s)]
*  I gotta be every, you know, everything has, it's like, [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=579.34s)]
*  or just every day, every life, it's like, man, [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=582.38s)]
*  everything is just like, it just, it just, [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=584.3s)]
*  and sometimes it builds up, it's like, [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=588.18s)]
*  and I don't even notice it's going on. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=590.0s)]
*  But it, yeah, but that's not the truth. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=596.26s)]
*  And I just, sometimes I let it build up and be the truth, [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=598.18s)]
*  or it's just, I can't explain it, [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=600.74s)]
*  but it starts happening in the background. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=603.46s)]
*  Like everything's gotta be perfect, you know? [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=604.86s)]
*  So yeah, I just wanna call that out on myself [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=609.58s)]
*  and just think, you know, like I can't make things, [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=611.78s)]
*  I can't be perfect, I can't make everything perfect. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=614.3s)]
*  Um. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=618.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=625.26s)]
*  So it just, I can't, you know. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=626.66s)]
*  And nobody's asking me to really, it's like, it's this, [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=631.3s)]
*  it's like this self-fulfilling, [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=636.6999999999999s)]
*  or not a self-unfulfilling prophecy. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=638.66s)]
*  You know, it's like, uh, [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=643.4399999999999s)]
*  it's a ridiculous pressure. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=646.42s)]
*  It goes back to when I, it probably associates [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=648.54s)]
*  to when I was young, you know? [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=650.5799999999999s)]
*  And I felt like if I wasn't perfect, then [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=655.9799999999999s)]
*  I wouldn't be cared about, you know? [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=660.5799999999999s)]
*  Or the only way I had a change, it was like, you know, [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=667.3s)]
*  I wasn't getting when I was, I don't know, [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=669.74s)]
*  I'm not trying to get into all that kind of stuff, [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=673.72s)]
*  but it was like, I guess, [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=675.64s)]
*  it's like if I was, if, [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=681.04s)]
*  it was like, I guess I felt like if I'm not, if I don't, [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=684.76s)]
*  the only way I have a chance to get what I need in the world [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=687.96s)]
*  is if I'm perfect. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=692.1999999999999s)]
*  Because I wasn't getting what I needed, so it was like, [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=695.38s)]
*  man, if I, I guess the only way I can, [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=697.52s)]
*  that I even have a chance, I must have to be perfect. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=699.88s)]
*  To get the care I need, you know? [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=704.08s)]
*  Or maybe if I'm perfect, [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=707.36s)]
*  maybe if I'm perfect, [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=711.3199999999999s)]
*  then I will have to be cared about, you know? [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=716.4s)]
*  Cause no, somebody couldn't not care about something [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=721.4s)]
*  that's perfect, you know? [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=725.48s)]
*  I don't know, I'm not saying that I'm perfect or anything, [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=729.84s)]
*  I'm just saying that's an old thing [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=731.36s)]
*  that would be in my head, man. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=732.76s)]
*  And it's not even a thought that I had or created, [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=735.4399999999999s)]
*  it was like a survival thing that happened when I was young. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=737.52s)]
*  And I could see how a kid could think that, you know? [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=740.12s)]
*  A kid could think that, so. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=745.04s)]
*  But yeah, sometimes that flares up, [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=749.84s)]
*  and I'm like, man, if I'm not perfect, [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=751.4s)]
*  then people are, [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=755.36s)]
*  people are not gonna like me. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=759.14s)]
*  You know, if I'm real honest about it. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=761.16s)]
*  And I know that isn't true, [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=764.96s)]
*  I know that's not true of like, my friend, [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=766.16s)]
*  like as an adult now, I know that's not the truth, [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=769.64s)]
*  but it still doesn't stop those old feelings from, [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=773.24s)]
*  they kind of take over the, [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=778.84s)]
*  they kind of hijack the mainframe sometimes. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=780.84s)]
*  And I get stuck in that space, [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=787.36s)]
*  and I get stuck in that space, [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=788.76s)]
*  and I don't even realize it, you know? [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=790.12s)]
*  So yeah, I just wanna share, [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=795.3199999999999s)]
*  I just wanna call that out to myself, [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=796.64s)]
*  and just say, yeah, man, you don't have to be, [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=800.4399999999999s)]
*  you are fine, you're okay, brother. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=802.64s)]

*  to notice, and I'm grateful now that I can even notice [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=816.28s)]
*  when that happens sometimes, [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=819.96s)]
*  so that I'm not just sitting there [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=821.16s)]

*  I mean, you see that river, and you see that mullet [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=994.8000000000001s)]

*  I mean, it's just stunning, you know, it's just a stunning, [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=1008.8000000000001s)]
*  it's a stunning place over there, [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=1012.4399999999999s)]
*  so if you get a chance to check that out, it's worth it, [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=1013.8s)]
*  and then we spent time over there in Toronto, [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=1017.72s)]
*  and Toronto, I'll say this, man, [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=1019.84s)]
*  there's, it's really friendly, folks, [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=1024.0s)]
*  it's, I mean, it's very friendly, [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=1029.68s)]
*  and it's very diverse, too, it is, [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=1032.2s)]
*  I mean, God, they got things you've never seen, [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=1034.96s)]
*  you know, they got, you know, they got things [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=1039.96s)]
*  you've never seen over there, you're like, [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=1043.8400000000001s)]
*  damn, you're a person, so it is mixed, baby, [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=1047.52s)]
*  and one thing that's different there is the racial, [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=1057.28s)]
*  there's not a, you don't feel a racial tension, [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=1062.28s)]
*  especially between black and white folks there, [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=1064.8s)]
*  now that, of course, you know, I'm white or semi-white, [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=1069.2s)]
*  you know, and so that's, you know, [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=1072.56s)]
*  I can just have my perception, you know, [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=1075.4s)]
*  and I grew up in a black and white area, [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=1077.72s)]
*  and so there's more history, you know, [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=1079.96s)]
*  racial history in the US, but in Canada, [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=1084.24s)]
*  that's not, it's really different, [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=1088.3600000000001s)]
*  it's the energy when you, when black and white people [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=1092.28s)]
*  are around each other, it's really, [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=1095.44s)]
*  it feels real clean, it feels like there's not, [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=1099.6000000000001s)]
*  there's not a bunch of faces from the history, [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=1106.88s)]
*  you know, there's not a bunch of like, [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=1110.0800000000002s)]
*  there's not a bunch of history, you know, [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=1113.24s)]
*  it just feels like there's just history of being human, [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=1116.64s)]
*  and that, to me, was, you know, it's nice, [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=1120.6000000000001s)]
*  it's nice to see, and it's nice to feel that, [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=1124.72s)]
*  so if you wanna, it just was real interesting experience, [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=1129.6000000000001s)]
*  man, because it's different in America, [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=1132.48s)]
*  and not everywhere in America, exactly, [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=1136.16s)]
*  and not always in America, but I'm just saying [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=1138.5600000000002s)]
*  kind of on average, and it was, [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=1141.92s)]
*  I thought that was pretty spectacular, man, you know, [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=1143.2s)]
*  and another thing about Canada, they're not, [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=1149.44s)]
*  there's not as many people trying to like, [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=1152.64s)]
*  it doesn't feel like, it's really safe, [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=1155.0400000000002s)]
*  I mean, it's safe, man, you don't feel scared, you feel, [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=1157.88s)]
*  you just, even if somebody's mean, [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=1163.24s)]
*  if you see a mean person, the worst thing, [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=1164.96s)]
*  they're gonna just gonna run up and say, [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=1166.64s)]
*  hey, I'm mean, and then they'll run off, you know, [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=1167.88s)]
*  and be like, hey, I'm mean, sorry, sorry about being mean, [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=1173.3600000000001s)]
*  but I still am, and then they'll run off, [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=1176.4s)]
*  that's like the, it's like, I don't know, [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=1180.6000000000001s)]
*  I think part of it is, they don't, [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=1185.4s)]
*  there's not people trying to get ahead, [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=1186.68s)]
*  there's not as much, like in America, [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=1188.2800000000002s)]
*  I feel like we're so conditioned that you have to get ahead, [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=1190.4s)]
*  you have to keep climbing, keep climbing, [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=1194.2s)]
*  and in Canada, they're more, [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=1198.68s)]
*  there's not as much of that energy, [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=1201.24s)]
*  and so when you're not, [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=1204.24s)]
*  when you're not trying to get ahead as much, [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=1207.4s)]
*  you have more energy just to be, [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=1209.72s)]
*  you're more happy where you are, [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=1212.3999999999999s)]
*  you're more happy where you are, [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=1215.96s)]
*  if you're not trying to climb, then you get to, [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=1217.36s)]
*  you have your energies there to stand in the group [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=1219.3999999999999s)]
*  and share with your community, [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=1223.4399999999998s)]
*  and so I think that's what I feel a lot, [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=1227.04s)]
*  is a lot more people are content, [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=1228.8799999999999s)]
*  and man, it's nice to be around, it's nice to witness, [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=1233.1999999999998s)]
*  it's nice to know that that's possible in a place, [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=1237.0s)]
*  because sometimes, sometimes, [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=1242.96s)]
*  it doesn't feel as possible here in America anymore to me, [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=1245.36s)]
*  and I'm not trying to be a downer, I just, [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=1249.08s)]
*  sometimes, you know, but yeah, it was just, [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=1251.32s)]
*  it's nice when you're just talking to somebody and that's, [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=1256.24s)]
*  they're just trying to be helpful, trying to be friendly, [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=1260.8s)]
*  not trying to get ahead or do anything, [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=1264.04s)]
*  just trying to be associated with their fellow man or woman. [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=1265.68s)]

*  Let's hear more, brother. [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=2427.08s)]
*  Secondly, I have a question for you. [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=2429.64s)]
*  I keep getting these relationships that don't work out, [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=2432.56s)]
*  and part of it's my fault, [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=2435.84s)]
*  and working through that in therapy, [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=2437.7200000000003s)]
*  but processing the emotions, man, [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=2439.7200000000003s)]
*  I just keep crying out this realization last week [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=2442.96s)]
*  that I'm not gonna be able to do it. [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=2445.48s)]
*  I'm not gonna be able to do it. [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=2447.92s)]
*  I had this realization last week [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=2449.8s)]
*  that anytime I really, really wanna drink and I'm alone, [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=2451.32s)]
*  typically just need to cry. [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=2454.44s)]
*  So I've been crying constantly, man, [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=2456.36s)]
*  and I'm like, God, I need you to stop. [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=2458.6800000000003s)]
*  So the question I have is, do I just keep crying it out, [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=2461.76s)]
*  or should I just buck up and stiff up and live? [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=2464.2400000000002s)]
*  Because I don't know, I'm trying to love myself [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=2469.84s)]
*  and get to a place where I can be good to someone else. [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=2473.2400000000002s)]
*  Anyway, I love you, man, [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=2476.5600000000004s)]
*  and I look forward to seeing you when you come to Denver. [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=2477.7599999999998s)]
*  Gang, brother, thanks for that, man. [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=2479.9599999999996s)]

*  what's going on with you, man. [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=2483.64s)]
*  Let me try and drop in here to this. [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=2487.9199999999996s)]
*  I think, yeah, tears, you gotta let tears out. [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=2493.64s)]
*  Tears, I believe that tears belong to God. [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=2498.48s)]
*  I really believe that. [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=2501.64s)]
*  Now a baby's tears don't. [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=2504.72s)]
*  A baby, a baby, a lot of time, baby just being an asshole, [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=2506.3199999999997s)]
*  and that's how a baby gonna be, boy. [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=2510.48s)]
*  But as an adult, man, tears really, I believe, [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=2513.56s)]
*  belong to God. [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=2516.72s)]
*  And a lot of times, yeah, you know, [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=2519.56s)]
*  there are emotions, they're attached to emotions. [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=2522.24s)]
*  And those emotions, they take, [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=2526.7599999999998s)]
*  it's hard to get them out of yourself. [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=2528.44s)]
*  You know, they go through a gauntlet of like, [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=2531.32s)]
*  of, you know, it takes, you know, [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=2535.32s)]
*  you'll be surprised when an emotion finally gets [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=2538.1200000000003s)]
*  to the surface of yourself. [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=2540.44s)]
*  So those tears, I feel like there are a lot of times, [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=2543.04s)]
*  they're sweat, man, they're the sweat of the, [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=2545.1200000000003s)]
*  the gauntlet that your emotions had to run through. [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=2550.4s)]
*  Just climbing through your soul. [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=2553.8s)]
*  That's the sweat of those feelings, man. [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=2556.28s)]
*  That's all that is. [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=2561.28s)]
*  Those feelings, you know, it's hard for them sometimes [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=2564.6400000000003s)]
*  to get out and get out of your body [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=2568.32s)]
*  and get out of your brain and get out of your heart. [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=2570.6000000000004s)]
*  Some of them have to go through your, [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=2574.1200000000003s)]
*  through the past, through time, and through your heart, [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=2575.52s)]
*  through your brain, through your, [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=2579.1600000000003s)]

*  he didn't even know. [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3029.96s)]
*  Yeah, brontosaurus had like a 90 yard neck. [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3030.9s)]
*  Like damn, what? [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3034.3199999999997s)]
*  He would eat, but it never made it to his stomach [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3035.44s)]
*  and they would die every time. [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3038.0s)]
*  They would die every time. [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3040.7200000000003s)]
*  Dude have a huge meal and then you couldn't get, [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3042.04s)]
*  the food couldn't get there and he died. [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3044.64s)]
*  You know, he just, and then they had triceratops, [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3048.5s)]
*  them things, 400 pound forehead, bro. [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3051.6s)]
*  Set like 70 pound body. [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3055.12s)]
*  So them bitches, second they was born, [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3057.94s)]
*  they took one step forward and just, [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3060.12s)]
*  and now every one of them died face down in the dirt. [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3062.12s)]
*  T-Rex, he couldn't do shit. [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3067.56s)]
*  All he could do is bite people. [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3069.16s)]
*  All he could do is bite people, man. [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3071.9s)]
*  You know, like a little pervert at a fucking mall, bro. [[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3075.4s)]
*  You know, they couldn't, he had them little arms. [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3080.4s)]
*  He had them baby reachers. [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3082.74s)]
*  He couldn't even fucking hug his buddy. [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3083.88s)]
*  Think about that. [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3086.04s)]
*  No wonder he's so angry. [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3087.92s)]
*  He can't even fucking hug. [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3090.16s)]
*  And so that's some of the early animals God made. [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3094.12s)]
*  That's prehistoria. [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3096.7599999999998s)]
*  Now some of those animals are still lurking around. [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3098.7799999999997s)]
*  Some of those animals still milling around in our world. [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3101.8199999999997s)]
*  And I wanna talk to a man who captured one of them [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3105.24s)]
*  down there in Mississippi over there. [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3108.1s)]
*  And they just captured a 800 pound alligator. [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3110.72s)]
*  Can you imagine that? [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3115.06s)]

*  Joey Clark, I believe is the man. [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3131.34s)]
*  Joey. [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3133.94s)]
*  Hey, what's going on, Theo? [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3136.26s)]
*  How you doing, man? [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3137.28s)]

*  If I'm coming on an LSU boys podcast, [[00:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3142.94s)]
*  I gotta represent, right? [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3146.48s)]
*  We'll call it a truce for a little while, baby. [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3148.22s)]
*  How about that, man? [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3150.14s)]
*  There you go. [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3151.62s)]
*  For about three or four weeks and it's back on. [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3152.46s)]
*  Okay, deal, man. [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3153.94s)]

*  Joey, tell me about this gator, baby. [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3160.2999999999997s)]
*  You guys caught that gator, huh? [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3162.22s)]
*  Yeah, man. [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3164.3199999999997s)]
*  This went with three of my buddies out there. [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3165.54s)]
*  We were in, we're outside of Yazoo City. [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3168.02s)]
*  Oh yeah, that's where Jerry Clower's from, [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3171.2599999999998s)]
*  Yazoo City, Mississippi. [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3174.7799999999997s)]
*  That's exactly right. [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3176.4199999999996s)]
*  That's exactly right. [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3177.46s)]
*  Went out there in Yazoo City [[00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3179.18s)]
*  and we've been to this spot over the years. [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3180.42s)]
*  I think this is probably the fourth or fifth gator [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3183.06s)]
*  I've caught with these guys, something like that. [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3186.32s)]
*  So we've been to that spot several times. [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3188.98s)]
*  Y'all are gator buddies, huh? [[00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3191.42s)]
*  That's right, that's right. [[00:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3193.38s)]
*  I've been with these fellas a few times [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3194.42s)]
*  and they've been several years without me as well. [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3196.14s)]
*  And so you get out there, you guys get out there, [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3199.58s)]
*  you're in a, what kind of vessel are you guys in? [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3201.5s)]
*  Not a submarine or anything, huh? [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3203.94s)]
*  No, we're in a 14 foot John boat. [[00:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3205.94s)]
*  Dang boy. [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3208.2200000000003s)]
*  I know, we brought this thing in the foot. [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3209.98s)]
*  That's some Tom Sawyer water work right there, buddy. [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3212.6600000000003s)]
*  That's right, that's right. [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3215.7000000000003s)]
*  That gator was about a foot hanging off of that boat [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3216.98s)]
*  while we were trying to get back in at night. [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3220.0600000000004s)]
*  And so what are you hooking on? [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3222.2200000000003s)]
*  When you, are you aiming for this type of big gator? [[00:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3223.7000000000003s)]
*  Are you aiming, what are you trying to catch? [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3226.94s)]
*  Are you guys looking for flounder? [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3228.6600000000003s)]
*  What are you guys trying to catch out there? [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3229.98s)]
*  Yeah, when you're out there, you're, I mean, [[00:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3232.0600000000004s)]
*  in this area, we've hooked up and caught several, [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3234.2599999999998s)]
*  12, 12 and a half foot gators out there. [[00:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3237.8599999999997s)]
*  And that's really what we're looking for. [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3240.06s)]
*  We don't, in Mississippi, the cool thing about here [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3241.3399999999997s)]
*  is it's not like Louisiana, it's not commercial. [[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3244.54s)]
*  They only give out about 900 tags a year. [[00:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3246.8199999999997s)]
*  So we got drawn in the lottery. [[00:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3249.3399999999997s)]
*  So you wanna make it count, right? [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3250.9399999999996s)]
*  You wanna make your gator count. [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3252.2599999999998s)]
*  You don't wanna come in there [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3253.4599999999996s)]
*  with a little nine foot gator if you don't have to, [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3254.2999999999997s)]
*  but nothing against that. [[00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3257.02s)]
*  Just, we've done that before, right? [[00:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3259.14s)]
*  So we- [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3261.18s)]
*  Yeah, it's probably embarrassing, I guess, [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3262.02s)]
*  if four men get out of a boat with a little baby gator, [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3263.38s)]
*  that looks probably- [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3266.1400000000003s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, we've- [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3266.98s)]
*  That's casual looking. [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3269.7000000000003s)]
*  We saw this gator just as we were putting in [[00:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3271.58s)]
*  right before dark and we had no idea it was this big. [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3273.94s)]
*  So we hopped in the boat, went out there [[00:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3276.78s)]
*  and we must have passed 20 to 25, 30 gators [[00:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3279.46s)]
*  on the way out there. [[00:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3283.1800000000003s)]
*  And they all look great and it's just a swamp [[00:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3284.02s)]
*  full of alligators out there, but- [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3286.9s)]
*  And how do you, can you tell, [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3288.7400000000002s)]
*  cause the eyes are usually poking out of the water. [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3290.7000000000003s)]
*  Can you tell how big a gator is [[00:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3292.78s)]
*  even just by its eyes poking out? [[00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3294.42s)]
*  You can tell, even when you get, [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3296.3s)]
*  you're far away from one, you can tell if he's undersized [[00:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3298.1000000000004s)]
*  and it's not something you don't wanna fool with. [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3300.9s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3302.3s)]
*  But you're out there at night, it's pitch black. [[00:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3303.1400000000003s)]
*  They got a pump sunshine out there [[00:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3306.1000000000004s)]
*  to that part of the state. [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3307.7400000000002s)]
*  And you're out there in that stuff and you got a Q beam [[00:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3309.7000000000003s)]
*  and you're just trying to light those eyes up [[00:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3313.1400000000003s)]
*  and go from there. [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3315.1400000000003s)]
*  And does the beam shock the gator at all? [[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3316.94s)]
*  Does it kind of get like a, [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3319.2200000000003s)]
*  like a, does it have that deer in headlights effect [[00:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3321.26s)]
*  on a gator or what is that like? [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3323.98s)]
*  It's not too much gonna shock him. [[00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3325.98s)]
*  When he, when he feels the vibrations in the water [[00:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3327.42s)]
*  of your boat and your trolling motor and all that, [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3329.9s)]
*  that's what's gonna make him kind of duck [[00:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3332.58s)]
*  and start trying to get away from you. [[00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3334.58s)]
*  And he held his breath, it seemed like 30 to 45 minutes [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3336.22s)]
*  at a time a couple of times. [[00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3339.94s)]
*  And we just had to keep on searching him. [[00:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3341.22s)]
*  And we hooked up to him the first time. [[00:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3343.38s)]
*  And what are you hooking him on? [[00:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3345.78s)]
*  Are you hooking him on a spinner bait? [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3347.3s)]
*  What do you got? [[00:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3348.86s)]
*  What do you even put out there? [[00:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3349.7s)]
*  Yeah, so it's just a treble hook. [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3350.98s)]
*  What are you guys using? [[00:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3352.46s)]
*  Are you guys using chicken livers? [[00:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3353.58s)]
*  Like, what do you use it? [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3354.9399999999996s)]
*  What's the bait? [[00:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3355.8199999999997s)]
*  No, there's no bait whatsoever. [[00:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3357.18s)]
*  Oh, there's no bait. [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3358.8199999999997s)]
*  No bait whatsoever. [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3360.3799999999997s)]
*  You're out there, you've got to see this gator [[00:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3361.5s)]
*  and then you've got to be talented enough [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3364.1s)]
*  to be able to throw a, just to throw that treble hook, [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3366.06s)]
*  that line right where you want to do it. [[00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3369.8199999999997s)]
*  Okay, so you're not, so there's no bait in, [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3372.02s)]
*  you're not trying to get him to get something like a fish [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3374.2599999999998s)]
*  or it is more, you are just trying to get the hook [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3377.34s)]
*  into his body. [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3380.9s)]
*  That's right, that's right. [[00:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3382.54s)]
*  Okay. [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3383.38s)]
*  You're trying to get the hook in his body. [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3384.2200000000003s)]
*  And eventually we kept on trying to hit him [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3385.06s)]
*  with one line at a time and we did that, [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3387.5s)]
*  but he kept breaking off. [[00:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3390.3s)]
*  And what these gators do, we must've, [[00:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3391.46s)]
*  we probably hooked up on him seven or eight times, I guess. [[00:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3394.54s)]
*  And he kept on shaking that treble hook out of him. [[00:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3397.58s)]
*  But what they're trying to do is go under logs [[00:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3400.54s)]
*  and things like that and shake that hook out of them. [[00:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3402.7400000000002s)]
*  And then they're free. [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3406.42s)]
*  And so that's kind of what the gist is there. [[00:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3407.78s)]
*  And do they seem nasty? [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3410.46s)]
*  Like did this gator seem like a nasty guy? [[00:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3411.82s)]
*  Or what did he seem, like can you get any semblance [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3413.98s)]
*  of what their personality is like? [[00:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3416.6600000000003s)]
*  Did he seem like a nasty guy? [[00:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3418.42s)]
*  Yeah, man, he was, he wasn't the meanest gator [[00:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3420.7400000000002s)]
*  we've ever run across. [[00:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3423.42s)]
*  We've run across some meaner ones, [[00:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3424.46s)]
*  but he was very territorial. [[00:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3425.82s)]
*  You know, he, the weird thing is we've hooked up [[00:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3427.42s)]
*  on some good sized gators in the past [[00:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3430.62s)]
*  and you know, you hook them once or twice [[00:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3432.98s)]
*  and now they kind of get the gist of what's going on. [[00:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3435.38s)]
*  You're trying to kill them and they disappear. [[00:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3437.5s)]
*  You'll never see them again. [[00:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3440.06s)]
*  But this gator, he wouldn't do that. [[00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3441.38s)]
*  He was there in that area. [[00:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3443.42s)]
*  You know, he's just- [[00:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3444.58s)]
*  He's probably a hoarder. [[00:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3445.9s)]
*  Have you seen that show like my 700 pound life [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3446.82s)]
*  or something that, cause that, those people don't not, [[00:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3449.02s)]
*  you know, they're usually locked in their house [[00:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3451.7400000000002s)]
*  with magazines, you know, they have like stacks [[00:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3453.54s)]
*  of magazines and everything. [[00:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3455.42s)]
*  That's right. [[00:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3456.7400000000002s)]
*  That's right. [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3457.58s)]
*  This thing is over there and yeah, he's in his spot [[00:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3458.42s)]
*  and he's not trying to get out of it. [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3461.26s)]
*  He's, he's doing his thing. [[00:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3462.6600000000003s)]
*  And like I say, he never left. [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3464.26s)]
*  He never left the 200 yard radius for us. [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3466.1800000000003s)]
*  And that's just crazy to me that it happened like that [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3468.42s)]
*  because we hooked into it the first time [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3470.98s)]
*  about 9.30 at night. [[00:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3473.1000000000004s)]
*  We didn't have that thing in the boat [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3474.7400000000002s)]
*  until 3.30 in the morning. [[00:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3476.0600000000004s)]
*  My God. [[00:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3477.46s)]
*  And so you hook him, you start getting him. [[00:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3478.5s)]
*  Now, how close is the boat at, [[00:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3481.7000000000003s)]
*  are you just right next to him? [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3483.82s)]
*  Yeah, you are. [[00:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3486.78s)]
*  So, you know, I'd say when you hook up on him initially, [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3487.6200000000003s)]
*  you know, you're probably within 15 feet of the gator [[00:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3490.7000000000003s)]
*  probably. [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3493.66s)]
*  So he's coming right up there. [[00:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3494.5s)]
*  Bro, I wouldn't be there, buddy. [[00:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3495.3399999999997s)]
*  I'd call a damn Uber, buddy. [[00:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3497.62s)]
*  I would not be right there. [[00:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3499.3399999999997s)]
*  I'll be glad to send you a couple of little videos [[00:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3501.7799999999997s)]
*  we took on the boat so you can kind of see [[00:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3503.7799999999997s)]
*  for yourself on this. [[00:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3505.3799999999997s)]
*  If that'd be something that would help [[00:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3507.22s)]
*  kind of put it together for you. [[00:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3508.54s)]
*  We'd love that. [[00:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3509.8999999999996s)]
*  We'll play some of those side by side [[00:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3511.1s)]
*  while we're talking about it. [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3512.58s)]
*  Okay, so you get him, you have, [[00:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3514.02s)]
*  how many hooks do you eventually get into the gator? [[00:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3515.74s)]
*  Finally, at the end, we did get a second hook in him. [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3518.58s)]
*  We had one, the first hook we caught, [[00:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3521.02s)]
*  which is not where you want to catch him, [[00:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3522.86s)]
*  would be back at the tail. [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3524.58s)]
*  And that's where my buddy Don, he blind cast out over him, [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3526.5s)]
*  hooked him in the tail. [[00:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3530.54s)]
*  We fought him for about another 30 minutes [[00:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3531.38s)]
*  so we could get a second hook in him. [[00:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3532.86s)]
*  Damn. [[00:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3534.1400000000003s)]
*  And so kind of my job with all this is when I'm in the boat, [[00:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3535.9s)]
*  you know, we've got a snare or whatever. [[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3538.9s)]
*  And my job is once he's come up from water. [[00:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3540.54s)]
*  And what do you mean a snare? [[00:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3542.1800000000003s)]
*  Yeah, so it's like a drum. [[00:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3543.9s)]
*  No, not a drum. [[00:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3546.46s)]
*  It's kind of like, I call it almost like a noose, right? [[00:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3547.38s)]
*  I mean, it's, you've got a rope on the end of it. [[00:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3551.3s)]
*  You slip it over his head. [[00:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3554.1800000000003s)]
*  And then when you do it, [[00:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3555.3s)]
*  I just pull that rope as hard as I can [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3556.2200000000003s)]
*  and basically try to sit down on the bottom of the boat [[00:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3558.5s)]
*  until. [[00:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3560.7400000000002s)]
*  So this is some damn BDSM shit it sounds like, huh? [[00:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3561.5800000000004s)]
*  Yes, indeed. [[00:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3565.1800000000003s)]
*  Yes, indeed. [[00:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3566.02s)]
*  Wow. [[00:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3566.86s)]
*  It's crazy. [[00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3568.1800000000003s)]
*  They wound up getting him at 14 feet, three inches. [[00:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3569.02s)]
*  So as of today, we've still got 24 hours left [[00:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3572.34s)]
*  in the state of Mississippi for gator hunting season. [[00:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3576.1000000000004s)]
*  But as of today, it's the state record. [[00:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3577.98s)]
*  Wow. [[00:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3579.7000000000003s)]
*  How much weight was it? [[00:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3580.66s)]
*  802.5 pounds. [[00:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3582.5s)]
*  Damn, boy. [[00:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3584.46s)]
*  And that missed the state record by 20 pounds. [[00:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3585.7s)]
*  So that just tells you how big they are down here. [[00:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3589.02s)]
*  Oh, so it didn't even make the weight record, [[00:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3591.22s)]
*  but it made the length record. [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3592.94s)]
*  That's right. [[00:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3594.5s)]
*  That's exactly right. [[00:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3595.34s)]
*  That's incredible, man. [[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3596.74s)]
*  It is, it is. [[00:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3598.2599999999998s)]
*  So once you have both of those hooks, [[00:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3599.34s)]
*  how are you elevating it out of the water? [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3600.94s)]
*  Like how does your boat not capsize? [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3603.86s)]
*  Yeah, so what he's doing, [[01:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3606.2599999999998s)]
*  when he's down there underwater, [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3608.02s)]
*  he's fighting and he's down there [[01:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3609.74s)]
*  and he's been down there. [[01:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3612.62s)]
*  At this point, over that seven hour period, [[01:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3613.94s)]
*  he had been in that water, [[01:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3616.46s)]
*  underwater the majority of that time. [[01:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3619.42s)]
*  But they gotta come up for air, right? [[01:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3621.8599999999997s)]
*  They gotta, at some point, [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3623.3799999999997s)]
*  they can't stay underwater forever. [[01:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3624.74s)]
*  They gotta come up. [[01:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3626.2599999999998s)]
*  So when they do, you gotta think about it as your, [[01:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3627.46s)]
*  these guys with the two lines [[01:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3630.7s)]
*  are pulling him closer and closer to the boat [[01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3632.22s)]
*  as they continue to fight him. [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3634.7799999999997s)]
*  And he continues to come up for air [[01:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3636.06s)]
*  a little bit more frequently towards the end. [[01:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3637.42s)]
*  And that's when it gets close enough to the boat [[01:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3640.46s)]
*  within, I'd say two or three feet if you can. [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3642.1s)]
*  And that's when you wanna put that snare around him [[01:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3645.34s)]
*  and hook him from there and kind of finish the deal off. [[01:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3647.62s)]
*  And do you choke him out? [[01:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3650.74s)]
*  Does somebody get on him? [[01:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3652.02s)]
*  How do you finish him? [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3653.02s)]
*  Man, I'm trying like hell to choke him out. [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3654.46s)]
*  I'm just holding him as tight as I can [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3656.1s)]
*  until somebody can shoot him. [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3658.02s)]
*  Oh, you shoot him? [[01:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3659.5s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, you gotta shoot him. [[01:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3661.22s)]
*  Oh, damn, bro. [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3662.2999999999997s)]
*  This is a damn, bro. [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3664.14s)]
*  This is a damn robbery, bro. [[01:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3665.86s)]
*  It is, it is. [[01:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3667.9s)]
*  It's a mugging for sure. [[01:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3669.7000000000003s)]
*  It is. God, I thought y'all were just towing him in. [[01:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3671.42s)]
*  No, no, no, no. [[01:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3675.02s)]
*  You gotta put that bad boy in the post. [[01:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3675.94s)]
*  Last thing you wanna do is tow him in [[01:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3677.6200000000003s)]
*  and then you lose him or something. [[01:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3679.42s)]
*  Because once, if he were to break off a rope or something, [[01:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3681.34s)]
*  he's at the bottom of the river, [[01:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3683.26s)]
*  you're not getting him back. [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3684.3s)]
*  And when he, after he's, right when he dies, [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3686.02s)]
*  do y'all hug or what do people like, [[01:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3688.7400000000002s)]
*  is there a celebration? [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3690.42s)]
*  What is that moment like? [[01:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3691.58s)]
*  Man, it's just a sense of relief. [[01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3692.94s)]
*  You've been out there with him all night long. [[01:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3694.46s)]
*  And the last thing you wanna do is let him off the hook. [[01:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3696.3799999999997s)]
*  Look, we had been out there for so long. [[01:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3698.8199999999997s)]
*  We were all just getting tired and worn out. [[01:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3700.74s)]
*  We'd been at work all day, all four of us, [[01:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3702.74s)]
*  just doing our thing and nobody wanted to give up. [[01:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3704.62s)]
*  And then we all fought about it. [[01:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3708.06s)]
*  But at the end of the night, [[01:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3709.22s)]
*  my buddy Tanner, the entire time, [[01:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3710.62s)]
*  he was like, we're not letting this gator go. [[01:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3713.14s)]
*  We're just not gonna do it. [[01:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3714.7s)]
*  So he was hell bent on getting this gator in the boat. [[01:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3715.66s)]
*  Oh, every Tanner I know will get hell bent. [[01:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3718.54s)]
*  They get hell bent on all kinds of shit. [[01:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3720.4199999999996s)]
*  You put a couple beers in them. [[01:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3721.8999999999996s)]
*  Were you guys having a couple beers? [[01:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3722.74s)]
*  No, there's no drinking out there. [[01:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3724.66s)]
*  There's no drinking. [[01:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3726.9s)]
*  It's a little bit too unsafe for that. [[01:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3727.74s)]
*  We tried to be as legal as we could [[01:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3729.2999999999997s)]
*  with getting this gator in and out. [[01:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3730.82s)]
*  And thank God we did. [[01:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3732.06s)]
*  Cause now, immediately when we pulled it out, [[01:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3733.14s)]
*  obviously the state wildlife department gets called. [[01:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3735.54s)]
*  They gotta come measure it and confirm it. [[01:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3737.66s)]
*  But no, no party. [[01:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3739.98s)]
*  And the party was after, I guess, [[01:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3740.82s)]
*  over the last 10 days, [[01:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3742.7799999999997s)]
*  just trying to let all this stuff sink in. [[01:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3744.42s)]
*  It's grown and blown up beyond our wildest expectations. [[01:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3747.54s)]
*  Man, that's exciting, brother. [[01:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3751.02s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3752.5s)]
*  And do y'all name him or anything? [[01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3753.34s)]
*  Is there anything like that? [[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3754.42s)]
*  The albarium, what happens? [[01:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3757.82s)]
*  Is there any things that happen like that? [[01:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3761.3s)]
*  No, so we don't, we got named him. [[01:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3763.7000000000003s)]
*  Wish we would have. [[01:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3765.34s)]
*  I wish you kind of brought something up. [[01:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3766.1800000000003s)]
*  Maybe we should do that. [[01:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3767.6600000000003s)]
*  But with the meat, we donated the meat [[01:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3769.82s)]
*  to an organization there in Yazoo city. [[01:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3773.3s)]
*  They kind of just, you know, [[01:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3775.98s)]
*  divvy that meat out to, you know, [[01:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3777.1400000000003s)]
*  underprivileged families and things like that. [[01:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3781.42s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3783.54s)]
*  And it came out to like 380 pounds of meat. [[01:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3784.38s)]
*  So it was a ton of meat on that. [[01:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3786.02s)]
*  And then- [[01:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3788.1s)]
*  Yeah, I remember they had an orphanage by us [[01:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3788.94s)]
*  and they would always, whenever people would cut, [[01:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3790.58s)]
*  that a lot of donated meat would go over there. [[01:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3793.46s)]
*  And sometimes I had a buddy that was over there [[01:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3796.54s)]
*  and we'd go over there and eat [[01:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3798.02s)]
*  and they'd always be eating gator up in that bitch. [[01:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3798.98s)]
*  It's kind of wild to think, [[01:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3801.02s)]
*  oh, it's crazy you go in there [[01:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3802.54s)]
*  and you see 20 fricking orphans, bro. [[01:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3803.78s)]
*  No, I don't- [[01:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3806.98s)]
*  Yumming down on some gator. [[01:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3807.82s)]
*  It's just like, damn. [[01:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3809.82s)]
*  That's it, man. [[01:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3810.66s)]
*  Get them some gator sausage [[01:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3811.5s)]
*  and then let them have a weekend, you know? [[01:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3812.38s)]
*  Oh yeah, if they don't have parents, dude, [[01:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3814.02s)]
*  get them some decent meat. [[01:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3815.5s)]
*  That's what I think. [[01:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3816.6600000000003s)]
*  Everybody deserves something. [[01:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3817.54s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3820.1400000000003s)]
*  But yeah, man, that was kind of the gist [[01:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3821.42s)]
*  of the gator itself. [[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3824.7400000000002s)]
*  I guess with this hide, [[01:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3827.1400000000003s)]
*  we're gonna get some leather boots made. [[01:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3828.06s)]
*  We're gonna be looking sharp come Christmas time, I guess. [[01:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3829.6200000000003s)]
*  We'll see what's up, but that's the plan. [[01:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3833.02s)]
*  Well, praise, brother. [[01:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3835.2200000000003s)]
*  Thank you so much for just jumping on [[01:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=3836.1400000000003s)]

*  I wanna deal with a little bit of laundry now, [[01:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=4156.4s)]
*  just some kind of behind the scenes stuff, really. [[01:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=4159.759999999999s)]
*  You know, you guys, we had an issue in the past [[01:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=4163.639999999999s)]
*  where Kai the Hitchhiker, and he's a famed, [[01:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=4166.28s)]
*  he, you know, he smashed, smashed, smashed somebody [[01:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=4172.48s)]
*  at an intersection with a hammer. [[01:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=4178.679999999999s)]
*  And he was that hammer baby, you know? [[01:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=4181.799999999999s)]
*  He's that freelance construction worker. [[01:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=4183.76s)]
*  And he was like a national celebrity, [[01:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=4186.4800000000005s)]
*  and then he did murder, he did a few murders. [[01:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=4190.96s)]
*  And so anyway, that was a famed clip. [[01:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=4195.280000000001s)]
*  Somebody took my face and put it on his clip, [[01:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=4198.360000000001s)]
*  and it made the rounds on social media, [[01:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=4201.72s)]
*  and it was, you know, funny and crazy. [[01:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=4203.8s)]
*  I can't believe that somebody made it. [[01:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=4205.8s)]
*  But then at a certain point, [[01:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=4208.74s)]
*  he filed a lawsuit against me, against me, [[01:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=4210.88s)]
*  and said that I was using his footage and his, [[01:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=4215.6s)]
*  like, name and like, I don't know, just his, using him. [[01:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=4221.68s)]
*  And so we reached out to Morgan & Morgan, [[01:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=4226.16s)]
*  who's a sponsor of the podcast, [[01:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=4230.56s)]
*  and my buddy Dan Morgan is one of the Morgans over there. [[01:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=4232.6s)]
*  And so they've been handling that case for us, [[01:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=4238.36s)]
*  and I thought it was over with, but apparently it's not. [[01:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=4239.88s)]
*  We're still getting stuff in the mail. [[01:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=4243.56s)]
*  And so I wanna check in right now. [[01:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=4245.0s)]
*  We have, is he on? [[01:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=4248.32s)]
*  We have Arthur Petrosian. [[01:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=4250.56s)]
*  That's right, hey, Theo. [[01:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=4253.66s)]
*  Hey, Arthur, how are you today? [[01:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=4254.76s)]
*  Good, brother, how are you? [[01:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=4256.8s)]
*  I'm doing pretty well, man, except, you know, [[01:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=4258.04s)]
*  I keep getting hammered by this case, man. [[01:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=4261.68s)]
*  This guy, he's a resilient, isn't he? [[01:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=4263.9800000000005s)]
*  Guy's definitely persistent. [[01:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=4267.6s)]
*  He's unfortunately been able to dance around [[01:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=4269.88s)]
*  some of these procedural issues in federal court, [[01:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=4272.4800000000005s)]
*  keeping the case alive. [[01:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=4274.96s)]
*  The court still has not heard the case on its merits. [[01:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=4277.0s)]
*  So we're confident that once they hear the case, [[01:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=4280.320000000001s)]
*  they're ultimately gonna dismiss it out. [[01:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=4283.4800000000005s)]
*  And how many, like, has he filed? [[01:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=4285.360000000001s)]
*  Because, yeah, I keep getting paperwork [[01:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=4287.4800000000005s)]
*  and a lot of handwritten stuff, and how many, [[01:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=4289.96s)]
*  like, how many things has he filed at this point? [[01:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=4293.84s)]
*  Multiple motions, multiple amended complaints. [[01:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=4298.6s)]
*  You know, it's fun to read, to be honest. [[01:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=4303.68s)]
*  You know, every time I come into the office [[01:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=4307.64s)]
*  and I get a handwritten note from Guy from his jail cell, [[01:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=4309.88s)]
*  I open it immediately, I can't wait to read it. [[01:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=4313.64s)]
*  I actually have a document that he filed with the court. [[01:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=4316.76s)]
*  So this is an official document [[01:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=4320.56s)]
*  that he filed in federal court. [[01:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=4322.08s)]
*  And this is all public record. [[01:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=4323.96s)]
*  So anytime you file a document in federal court, [[01:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=4325.72s)]
*  anybody that has an account can go in and look at this. [[01:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=4328.64s)]
*  So I think this paragraph gives you a glimpse [[01:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=4332.12s)]
*  of what this case is all about and what he's been doing. [[01:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=4336.44s)]
*  And if you'd like, I'll read it, it's actually kind of fun. [[01:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=4339.44s)]
*  Yeah, I'd love to, yeah, let's get it. [[01:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=4342.16s)]
*  So this is Guy in his moving papers. [[01:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=4344.68s)]
*  He says, plaintiff is writing this at 5.30 in the morning [[01:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=4346.76s)]
*  in a sweltering hot cell in a stone building [[01:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=4351.16s)]
*  without air conditioning that heats up during the day [[01:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=4354.04s)]
*  and holds the heat throughout the night. [[01:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=4356.8s)]
*  He's using a floppy, shank-proof pen. [[01:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=4358.96s)]
*  He typed this at the law library, [[01:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=4362.599999999999s)]
*  but he only gets five hours once a week [[01:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=4365.16s)]
*  if he's granted extended access. [[01:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=4367.92s)]
*  And his access just ran out. [[01:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=4369.76s)]
*  And then it goes on to say, [[01:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=4372.36s)]
*  even now, plaintiff has to wake up at 3.30 in the morning, [[01:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=4374.72s)]
*  get his work on this opposition done before 11 a.m. [[01:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=4378.4s)]
*  or else the sweat soaked document [[01:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=4381.639999999999s)]
*  would be unacceptable for filing. [[01:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=4383.679999999999s)]
*  Wow. [[01:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=4385.48s)]
*  Defendant, and that's you, in contra distinction, [[01:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=4387.08s)]
*  and these are his words, [[01:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=4390.88s)]
*  has been making comedy videos in an air conditioned studio, [[01:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=4392.5199999999995s)]
*  making a show in the most literal sense [[01:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=4397.599999999999s)]
*  of slacking off, enjoying himself, [[01:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=4400.44s)]
*  instead of filing a responsive pleading. [[01:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=4403.0s)]
*  The court can see for themselves [[01:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=4405.839999999999s)]
*  that during the time in question, [[01:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=4407.4s)]
*  defendant was having the time of his life. [[01:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=4409.32s)]
*  So, you know, it's going nowhere. [[01:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=4414.839999999999s)]
*  It's just things like this that he continues to file. [[01:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=4417.839999999999s)]
*  Again, the court, in order to provide him with due process, [[01:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=4420.92s)]
*  is kind of entertaining him at this point. [[01:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=4425.48s)]
*  Okay. [[01:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=4427.599999999999s)]
*  But we strongly believe that within the next 60 to 90 days, [[01:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=4428.879999999999s)]
*  when the court actually hears the merits of the case [[01:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=4432.08s)]
*  and actually reviews our motion to dismiss [[01:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=4435.04s)]
*  that they're going to grant it. [[01:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=4437.96s)]
*  So will we have to go to court, do you think? [[01:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=4439.2s)]
*  I would. [[01:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=4441.8s)]
*  You don't have to, [[01:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=4442.88s)]
*  but I will definitely be there representing you. [[01:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=4444.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[01:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=4446.16s)]
*  First of all, thank you very much. [[01:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=4447.0s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely. [[01:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=4448.8s)]
*  I can't believe it. [[01:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=4449.96s)]
*  I'm glad to be here. [[01:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=4450.8s)]
*  I'm just crazy. [[01:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=4451.62s)]
*  Yeah, I know. [[01:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=4452.46s)]
*  I'm really grateful for you guys helping, man. [[01:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=4453.3s)]
*  God, I mean, it's just so, [[01:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=4455.08s)]
*  and so I guess if somebody's in jail, [[01:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=4457.0s)]
*  they still have the right, they can still sue somebody. [[01:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=4459.28s)]
*  They can still, even if they did murder, [[01:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=4461.84s)]
*  they can still, you don't lose those rights. [[01:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=4463.92s)]
*  You know, absolutely. [[01:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=4467.52s)]
*  And this is what this case is about. [[01:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=4468.68s)]
*  And that's why we've been kind of sitting on the sidelines [[01:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=4471.04s)]
*  for about six to eight months, [[01:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=4473.38s)]
*  is because the federal court wants to make sure [[01:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=4474.92s)]
*  that they provide Kai his due process rights [[01:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=4477.52s)]
*  and they hear him out. [[01:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=4480.36s)]
*  Again, eventually this case gets dismissed, [[01:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=4481.88s)]
*  but for now we're going through the motions [[01:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=4484.76s)]
*  and making sure that the court hears him out. [[01:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=4486.92s)]
*  Wow. [[01:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=4489.56s)]
*  And do you guys get a lot of cases like this? [[01:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=4491.0s)]
*  You know, we don't handle a lot of cases like this, [[01:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=4495.48s)]
*  but we pride ourselves in fighting for the people. [[01:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=4498.64s)]
*  And we consider you a good friend, Theo. [[01:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=4502.08s)]
*  So we're all hands on deck on this case. [[01:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=4504.0s)]
*  We've got multiple people pushing it. [[01:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=4507.24s)]
*  We've got experts lined up as well too, [[01:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=4509.4s)]
*  just to make sure that you're gonna be protected [[01:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=4511.76s)]
*  from every angle. [[01:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=4513.44s)]
*  So, you know, it's kind of an exciting case. [[01:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=4514.8s)]
*  It provides some comic value for us. [[01:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=4517.76s)]
*  Because it's different than a lot of the other cases. [[01:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=4521.120000000001s)]
*  I almost, well, first of all, thank you guys so much, man. [[01:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=4525.320000000001s)]
*  You know, Dan Morgan is a nice guy [[01:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=4529.360000000001s)]
*  and we have a lot of mutual friends. [[01:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=4533.080000000001s)]
*  And thank you guys too for supporting the podcast. [[01:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=4534.64s)]
*  And I know you guys mostly handle like personal injury, [[01:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=4538.88s)]
*  that type of stuff. [[01:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=4541.240000000001s)]
*  That's right. [[01:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=4542.64s)]
*  Right. [[01:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=4543.46s)]
*  But it would almost be crazy. [[01:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=4544.3s)]
*  What if we got to go do like a deposition or something? [[01:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=4545.780000000001s)]
*  That would be wild, wouldn't it? [[01:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=4548.160000000001s)]
*  That would be wild. [[01:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=4551.12s)]
*  It would be very entertaining. [[01:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=4551.96s)]
*  We would probably have to take it in jail, [[01:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=4553.5199999999995s)]
*  in Kai's cell probably. [[01:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=4555.84s)]
*  I don't know if he'll get extended hours [[01:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=4557.88s)]
*  to go to the law library to do his deposition from there. [[01:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=4559.5199999999995s)]
*  That would be exciting to do. [[01:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=4563.719999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I appreciate it, man. [[01:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=4566.96s)]
*  Thanks for like at least recognizing that [[01:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=4568.0s)]
*  this is kind of entertaining along the way. [[01:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=4570.599999999999s)]
*  I'm sure it is a little bit different than normal. [[01:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=4572.4s)]
*  Yeah, he's definitely kind of a notorious figure. [[01:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=4575.8s)]
*  So. [[01:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=4579.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=4580.719999999999s)]
*  Well, we're excited to back you up. [[01:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=4582.44s)]
*  If there's anything else you need, you let us know. [[01:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=4583.5599999999995s)]
*  Thank you. [[01:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=4585.679999999999s)]
*  Hopefully I will not, but I appreciate that. [[01:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=4586.5199999999995s)]
*  You got it, man. [[01:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=4590.16s)]
*  All right, have a good day, brother. [[01:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=4591.0s)]
*  You too. [[01:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=4592.36s)]
*  Wow, so that's interesting. [[01:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=4594.0s)]
*  You know, that's, but you know, I'm grateful that, [[01:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=4596.12s)]
*  you know, if people, if you, [[01:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=4598.799999999999s)]
*  that you don't lose all your rights, you know? [[01:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=4600.5199999999995s)]
*  I mean, what a, what a fortunate country [[01:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=4603.0s)]
*  where you can do a murder [[01:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=4605.24s)]
*  and still go and have rights. [[01:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=4609.44s)]
*  I mean, that is, you don't get, [[01:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=4613.759999999999s)]
*  some places you don't even get that, you know. [[01:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=4616.5199999999995s)]
*  I'm sure there's a lot of countries where you don't get that. [[01:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=4619.5199999999995s)]
*  Where if you do a murder, that's it. [[01:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=4622.28s)]
*  You know, they're like, hey buddy, you do, you do, [[01:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=4624.96s)]
*  you do the murder, then you, that's all you doing. [[01:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=4627.44s)]
*  Sticking in the legal, in the legal space, [[01:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=4634.719999999999s)]
*  I wanna talk about something that has been tough for, [[01:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=4637.8s)]
*  I wanna talk about something. [[01:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=4642.16s)]
*  We, our podcast was defrauded. [[01:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=4644.96s)]
*  We were stolen from, we were taken advantage of, [[01:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=4647.52s)]
*  a lot of ways to say it. [[01:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=4651.88s)]
*  The company that did it is Cast Media, [[01:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=4654.08s)]
*  and the man that did it is Colin Thompson. [[01:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=4657.280000000001s)]
*  And I'm gonna put his picture in here. [[01:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=4660.72s)]
*  And it's, I don't know exactly how to say this, [[01:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=4662.92s)]
*  I'm gonna do my best. [[01:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=4667.92s)]
*  We're part of a larger group of podcasts [[01:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=4670.92s)]
*  that were stolen from, right? [[01:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=4673.200000000001s)]
*  We were part, in total, I've, just between talking with folks, [[01:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=4677.200000000001s)]
*  there's up to $4 million that I know of, [[01:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=4682.200000000001s)]
*  that people were taking advantage of. [[01:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=4684.0s)]
*  We're in the six figures, I know of podcasts [[01:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=4686.160000000001s)]
*  that are in the seven figures. [[01:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=4688.080000000001s)]
*  And Colin Thompson, that's his name. [[01:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=4689.52s)]
*  I wanna say his name so you know it. [[01:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=4691.6s)]
*  People get taken advantage of a lot in business, [[01:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=4694.4800000000005s)]
*  and businesses use tactics and stuff to hide, [[01:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=4696.360000000001s)]
*  to hide themselves. [[01:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=4700.160000000001s)]
*  And they'll use bankrupts here, [[01:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=4701.64s)]
*  the threat of this or that, and he may get my money, [[01:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=4704.360000000001s)]
*  that's okay. [[01:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=4709.92s)]
*  I'm fortunate that I can still have touring [[01:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=4711.240000000001s)]
*  and that I can take care of myself. [[01:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=4713.8s)]
*  But you fuck with the wrong rat, Colin. [[01:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=4716.36s)]
*  I'll tell you that, brother. [[01:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=4718.639999999999s)]
*  And I'll just tell you guys what happened. [[01:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=4719.759999999999s)]
*  We had a deal with this company, right? [[01:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=4722.92s)]
*  And it was started off good, [[01:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=4725.92s)]
*  and then it started to get where we were [[01:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=4727.84s)]
*  getting less of our payments. [[01:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=4729.92s)]
*  And we were reading the ads, we do the ads, [[01:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=4732.679999999999s)]
*  we read them out loud, and we, [[01:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=4735.24s)]
*  and you guys support some of them, and thank you. [[01:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=4737.28s)]
*  And then, we were, we were, [[01:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=4741.84s)]
*  and then it got to be where we were getting paid [[01:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=4744.8s)]
*  less of the payment we were owed. [[01:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=4748.96s)]
*  And they sell all the ads a year in advance, [[01:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=4751.28s)]
*  so you're kind of stuck into the year, right? [[01:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=4753.24s)]
*  And the advertisers were paying Colin Thompson [[01:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=4756.759999999999s)]
*  and Cast Media, and they weren't paying us. [[01:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=4760.12s)]
*  They would pay us a little bit, and they had a reason why. [[01:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=4762.28s)]
*  So one of the craziest parts was like, [[01:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=4766.0s)]
*  there was like, we kept asking, [[01:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=4768.04s)]
*  you know, hey, we have to get paid, man. [[01:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=4770.759999999999s)]
*  We have to, and we weren't getting paid. [[01:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=4772.44s)]
*  And so finally, I was able to make a new deal [[01:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=4774.360000000001s)]
*  and just cut ties completely. [[01:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=4777.0s)]
*  I made sure that everything, you know, [[01:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=4778.52s)]
*  they breached our contract, and so I was able to cut ties. [[01:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=4779.96s)]
*  And then they come along, Colin Thompson comes along, [[01:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=4783.96s)]
*  and he joins, there's a new company that has a stock [[01:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=4787.96s)]
*  that's going live soon, right, [[01:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=4793.84s)]
*  or it's coming out or something. [[01:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=4795.4400000000005s)]
*  This company called Podcast One or Live One, right? [[01:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=4797.08s)]
*  They get me on a call with, I think the guy's name, [[01:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=4801.88s)]
*  Rob Ellen, yeah, that's the guy's name, Rob Ellen. [[01:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=4808.76s)]
*  And his brother is Doug Ellen, who's like a screenwriter, [[01:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=4815.400000000001s)]
*  and I think he did. [[01:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=4818.92s)]
*  His brother was pretty successful. [[01:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=4820.400000000001s)]
*  But they get me on a call with this guy, Rob Ellen, right? [[01:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=4823.12s)]
*  And they tell me that if you come over to our new network, [[01:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=4826.92s)]
*  over to this new network, Podcast One, [[01:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=4836.8s)]
*  that we'll pay you some of what you're owed in stock, right? [[01:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=4839.4s)]
*  But the stock hasn't gone public, so they're trying, [[01:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=4844.36s)]
*  it felt like to me, they're trying to leverage our podcast [[01:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=4846.92s)]
*  and other podcasts to then make their stock do well. [[01:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=4852.6s)]
*  And then if that happens, [[01:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=4861.0s)]
*  then we'll get a share of our money, right? [[01:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=4863.04s)]
*  Like, it just, the whole thing to me felt really seedy. [[01:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=4865.96s)]
*  And the worst part to me was, I said, [[01:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=4872.56s)]
*  well, what about Colin Thompson? [[01:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=4876.56s)]
*  I said, that guy's a crook. [[01:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=4879.84s)]
*  And they said, he's gonna be, [[01:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=4881.96s)]
*  he'll be, they said, we felt like he's done a good job [[01:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=4885.84s)]
*  and that he would be part of the team still. [[01:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=4891.12s)]
*  So that's just, I know some of this [[01:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=4895.08s)]
*  is a lot of insider baseball, man, [[01:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=4897.52s)]
*  but to me, it was just fucking, it felt real dirty [[01:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=4899.12s)]
*  and it felt like just no respect for podcasting, [[01:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=4903.68s)]
*  no respect for the work that we had done, [[01:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=4909.56s)]
*  to get paid by the advertisers and then not pay us. [[01:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=4913.68s)]
*  And then for Colin to lead us in this direction [[01:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=4916.56s)]
*  and say, well, if you join this other group [[01:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=4919.92s)]
*  before their stock goes out, [[01:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=4922.320000000001s)]
*  that then we'll pay you in some of the stock, [[01:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=4923.96s)]
*  but part of that will be based on if we're there [[01:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=4927.76s)]
*  for it to do well. [[01:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=4930.1s)]
*  I don't know, man, but I know what it feels like [[01:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=4932.84s)]
*  to be taken advantage of. [[01:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=4935.96s)]
*  And I wouldn't do that to these people. [[01:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=4938.52s)]
*  I wouldn't do that to Colin Thompson. [[01:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=4940.360000000001s)]
*  I wouldn't do that to Cast Media. [[01:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=4941.92s)]
*  And so I say this just because I don't want this guy [[01:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=4945.320000000001s)]
*  taking advantage of anybody else. [[01:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=4947.4400000000005s)]
*  A lot of times in business practices, [[01:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=4950.280000000001s)]
*  especially in like entertainment stuff, [[01:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=4952.160000000001s)]
*  a lot of people are able to snake away [[01:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=4955.4800000000005s)]
*  and they're able to slip through and use tactics [[01:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=4958.12s)]
*  and shell games and bullshit. [[01:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=4961.06s)]
*  But you fucked with the wrong rat, homie. [[01:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=4965.96s)]
*  I have a voice. [[01:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=4968.400000000001s)]
*  And a lot of other people are forced into these bad deals [[01:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=4969.64s)]
*  because they're afraid to speak up. [[01:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=4972.200000000001s)]
*  They're afraid to speak up, man. [[01:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=4975.240000000001s)]
*  And that's not what our show is about. [[01:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=4977.160000000001s)]
*  And yeah, I just want you guys to know [[01:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=4979.68s)]
*  that this is the man. [[01:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=4984.96s)]
*  We put his picture up on the thing, on the YouTube. [[01:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=4987.200000000001s)]
*  And the amount of money that I, from other people, [[01:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=4990.52s)]
*  these podcasts, as they've said, is over $4 million. [[01:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=4994.98s)]
*  And yeah, it's just, the shit's fucking wrong. [[01:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=5000.7s)]
*  And I don't also understand how a company [[01:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=5006.419999999999s)]
*  expects me to come, wanted me to come over there [[01:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=5008.82s)]
*  to boot what felt like to me, they were using me [[01:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=5012.7s)]
*  to boost their stock price. [[01:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=5015.0199999999995s)]
*  And I don't say that out of ego, but we've done well. [[01:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=5016.5s)]
*  And that they get all these podcasts saying, [[01:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=5020.099999999999s)]
*  well, that'll boost our stock price. [[01:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=5022.219999999999s)]
*  Then we'll go public with the stock. [[01:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=5023.58s)]
*  And then based again on their backs, [[01:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=5025.26s)]
*  there'll be money there. [[01:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=5030.86s)]
*  So it was like, it felt like y'all gonna try [[01:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=5032.46s)]
*  to fuck me twice, homie. [[01:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=5034.0599999999995s)]
*  Well, no, no thank you. [[01:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=5035.86s)]
*  So yeah, you can keep that money. [[01:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=5040.84s)]
*  You can't keep it. [[01:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=5043.26s)]
*  We'll see how it plays out. [[01:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=5044.22s)]
*  But if you do end up keeping it, man, [[01:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=5045.48s)]
*  you must've needed it. [[01:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=5047.86s)]
*  You must've needed it, I don't know. [[01:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=5049.64s)]
*  I mean, it doesn't make me stoked, but, [[01:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=5051.62s)]
*  but you can't get me to shut up, man. [[01:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=5056.1s)]
*  You can't get me to shut up. [[01:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=5059.24s)]
*  And if that's the cost of it, for me to say my fucking piece, [[01:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=5061.74s)]
*  you know how many other podcasters wanted to say [[01:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=5067.46s)]
*  this shit right now, but can't say it? [[01:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=5069.12s)]
*  So anyway, [[01:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=5073.62s)]
*  yeah, that's who I just want you to know. [[01:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=5076.56s)]
*  I want you to know about Collin Thompson. [[01:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=5079.56s)]
*  I want you to know where I've heard [[01:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=5080.8s)]
*  he's going to be working at. [[01:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=5082.96s)]
*  And I want you to know that he's a crook. [[01:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=5084.64s)]
*  And to me, it's criminal. [[01:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=5086.6s)]
*  But the way that people are able to cheat and lie [[01:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=5089.24s)]
*  and manipulate the system, [[01:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=5092.64s)]
*  you know, he went and got Neil Sacker, [[01:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=5096.88s)]
*  who worked with Harvey Weinstein to jump on the calls. [[01:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=5098.84s)]
*  I mean, he just, he was a crook. [[01:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=5102.0s)]
*  Fuck, it's just fucking kind of sad, man. [[01:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=5104.44s)]
*  And yeah, but I just wanted to speak up for myself, man. [[01:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=5107.44s)]
*  I've waited a year to speak up for myself. [[01:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=5111.24s)]
*  You know, they put us through so much bullshit. [[01:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=5113.44s)]
*  And I don't know if there's other people over there [[01:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=5116.48s)]
*  that did it too, and maybe we'll get more information, [[01:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=5117.96s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=5119.799999999999s)]
*  Or this may be all you ever hear about it, you know? [[01:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=5120.639999999999s)]
*  And so I didn't really know the best way to do this, [[01:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=5123.5599999999995s)]
*  but I just wanted to say, [[01:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=5128.36s)]
*  I didn't really know the best way to do this, [[01:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=5130.96s)]
*  but yeah, I wouldn't do that to somebody. [[01:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=5133.76s)]
*  And they did it, man, they did it to, [[01:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=5137.96s)]
*  I mean, some of these people's podcasts, [[01:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=5140.0s)]
*  this is all they had, man. [[01:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=5141.4400000000005s)]
*  And these motherfuckers did that, bro. [[01:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=5143.4800000000005s)]
*  So I'm sorry about that. [[01:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=5145.320000000001s)]
*  And I'm sorry for them. [[01:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=5148.6s)]
*  And yeah, I'm just happy to have a voice for myself. [[01:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=5149.52s)]
*  And that's one thing that we built here [[01:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=5152.4400000000005s)]
*  that he had nothing to do with. [[01:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=5154.240000000001s)]
*  He had nothing to do with. [[01:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=5156.68s)]
*  In fact, he stole on our backs once, [[01:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=5158.200000000001s)]
*  and I'm not letting these people do it to me two times. [[01:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=5160.36s)]
*  So for anybody that had to take that sucker deal over there, [[01:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=5163.0s)]
*  this voice, I'm speaking for all of us, man. [[01:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=5167.08s)]
*  Because I know that some of you guys have said to me [[01:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=5170.64s)]
*  that you wanted to say some of these same things. [[01:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=5172.24s)]
*  And I don't mean that out of ego, [[01:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=5173.96s)]
*  I just mean that, I don't know, I feel, [[01:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=5176.32s)]
*  you know, I don't know, sorry, [[01:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=5182.44s)]
*  maybe I shouldn't have said that part. [[01:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=5183.8s)]
*  I don't wanna speak on behalf of those people, [[01:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=5185.2s)]
*  but yeah, I just wouldn't have done that to somebody. [[01:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=5186.6s)]
*  And I'm happy to be able to speak for myself. [[01:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=5191.400000000001s)]
*  I'm so thankful, I'm thankful to you guys, [[01:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=5195.160000000001s)]
*  to the listeners that we have this place here. [[01:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=5196.76s)]
*  And that this is what we try to do. [[01:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=5200.6s)]
*  And I'm sorry I've been making this about me [[01:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=5202.6s)]
*  this past five or six minutes or whatever, [[01:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=5204.160000000001s)]
*  but this was the only public place I could do this, [[01:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=5206.04s)]
*  where I feel like it would have some effect [[01:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=5212.84s)]
*  because to me this guy's like the Bernie Madoff [[01:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=5214.44s)]
*  of podcasting. [[01:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=5216.799999999999s)]
*  And that almost glorifies him in a weird way. [[01:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=5218.0s)]
*  But I wanted to be able to say that, sorry, [[01:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=5222.08s)]
*  I'm just rambling, but I wanted to be able [[01:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=5224.5599999999995s)]
*  to speak my piece. [[01:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=5228.16s)]
*  Thank you. [[01:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=5231.48s)]
*  With that said, man, let's get back into something here. [[01:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=5234.599999999999s)]
*  I wanna say this, you know, I just saw on Twitter [[01:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=5238.5199999999995s)]
*  where Max Holloway, who is from Maui, [[01:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=5241.16s)]
*  was sharing about how a donation that was made [[01:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=5243.68s)]
*  to the Maui Food Bank. [[01:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=5247.64s)]
*  And then Dustin Poirier and the Good Fight Foundation [[01:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=5249.280000000001s)]
*  matched their efforts, a $10,000 match. [[01:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=5255.56s)]
*  And on behalf of this past weekend, [[01:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=5258.4400000000005s)]
*  we wanna do the same thing. [[01:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=5260.68s)]
*  I know there's a lot of listeners out there [[01:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=5262.04s)]
*  who think like, well, how can I help and what can I do? [[01:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=5263.400000000001s)]
*  And so we're gonna do that together here. [[01:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=5266.08s)]
*  And so yeah, we're gonna match that 10,000. [[01:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=5269.76s)]
*  There's some charities also that Kelly Slater shared [[01:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=5273.4400000000005s)]
*  about, The Surf Man. [[01:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=5276.4800000000005s)]
*  And so we'll see, but we wanna, we're gonna match [[01:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=5278.56s)]
*  that $10,000 for Maui. [[01:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=5282.0s)]
*  And that's this past weekend, that's us doing that. [[01:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=5283.68s)]
*  So if you're a listener and today you're feeling [[01:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=5287.04s)]
*  like I wanted to do something for the people of Maui, [[01:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=5290.08s)]
*  you just did, and we did that. [[01:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=5293.72s)]
*  And yeah, sorry, I hope that doesn't sound egotistical. [[01:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=5296.44s)]
*  Sorry, man, my brain's a little all over the place [[01:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=5298.48s)]
*  from sharing some of that. [[01:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=5301.0s)]
*  You know, I think when I get taken advantage of it, [[01:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=5304.24s)]
*  attaches it to like old feelings of shit. [[01:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=5306.2s)]
*  And yeah, it makes me feel, [[01:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=5308.92s)]
*  it makes me feel, [[01:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=5318.96s)]
*  it attaches to old feelings of shit. [[01:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=5322.719999999999s)]
*  It attaches to old feelings of like, [[01:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=5325.56s)]
*  that I don't have any worth or something. [[01:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=5327.36s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=5329.44s)]
*  I don't know, sorry. [[01:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=5331.0s)]
*  All right, what else can we do? [[01:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=5334.36s)]
*  Anything else you wanna say, Riley? [[01:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=5337.08s)]
*  You know, just that, you know, [[01:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=5340.84s)]
*  I'm glad that my family is safe. [[01:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=5342.24s)]
*  I have some family out in Maui. [[01:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=5345.68s)]
*  Some cousins out there that, they're both firefighters [[01:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=5349.24s)]
*  and I'm just glad everyone's safe. [[01:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=5351.76s)]
*  Really, huh? [[01:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=5355.200000000001s)]
*  Firefighters, so were they, [[01:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=5356.04s)]
*  they must've been involved, huh? [[01:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=5357.68s)]
*  Yes, they all lost their homes. [[01:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=5360.08s)]
*  Oh man. [[01:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=5362.96s)]
*  Oh. [[01:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=5367.320000000001s)]
*  Man, the world, sometimes there's just so much going on, [[01:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=5372.08s)]
*  it feels just, really, it feels like a lot, doesn't it? [[01:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=5374.4800000000005s)]
*  Yeah, definitely. [[01:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=5378.76s)]

*  I'm sorry that that happened for them. [[01:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=5381.52s)]
*  You know, that community over there, [[01:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=5383.2s)]
*  God, there is nothing more special [[01:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=5384.92s)]
*  if you get to witness it in your life [[01:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=5386.64s)]
*  than some of the connectivity [[01:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=5390.96s)]
*  of some of that community over there [[01:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=5392.4s)]
*  and Maui, the other islands as well. [[01:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=5393.84s)]
*  It's just something really, really special, you know? [[01:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=5397.4400000000005s)]
*  So our thoughts are still with them, man, and yeah. [[01:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=5402.64s)]

*  Yeah, so yeah, thank you guys, man, [[01:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=5432.84s)]

*  Yeah, it just doesn't have to be perfect, you know? [[01:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=5438.88s)]
*  You ever feel like that, Riley? [[01:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=5444.76s)]
*  I do. [[01:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=5447.76s)]
*  Yeah, where do you think it comes from, man, [[01:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=5450.32s)]
*  or what do you think about it? [[01:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=5452.0s)]
*  Yeah, you know, it just, [[01:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=5456.2s)]
*  you don't always have to be perfect. [[01:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=5457.4400000000005s)]
*  Yeah, because we can't be, right? [[01:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=5460.88s)]
*  Right. [[01:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=5463.04s)]
*  Yeah, so it's a fool's errand, isn't it? [[01:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=5464.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=5467.92s)]
*  Man, but it almost feels like we should be, [[01:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=5468.76s)]
*  or we need to be, does it ever feel like that to you? [[01:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=5473.28s)]
*  Sometimes, yeah. [[01:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=5476.8s)]
*  And what do you do then when it happens? [[01:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cziCepYeEM&t=5478.88s)]
