*  Yeah. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=165.0s)]
*  If you want to be that cold and move to like the North Pole or something, but don't just pretend you're like the you're fucking Santa, you know, just because you're in your garage. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=166.0s)]
*  Do we have at San Francisco? [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=177.0s)]
*  We have two ice tubs and one's at 39 degrees. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=179.0s)]
*  The other ones are like 45. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=181.0s)]
*  Yeah. I'm in the fourth like the 39 degree. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=183.0s)]
*  It's like, what are we doing? [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=185.0s)]
*  That's what Bosa does all the time. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=186.0s)]
*  Really? [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=187.0s)]
*  Yeah. He likes that one. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=188.0s)]
*  He loves being cold. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=189.0s)]
*  But like my pool in California, it's it's not heated. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=190.0s)]
*  And so by mid October, it's like it's like 52. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=193.0s)]
*  And then by the time you get through halfway through November, it's like 46. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=198.0s)]
*  And I just jump in every morning at 630 a.m. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=201.0s)]
*  Oh, wow. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=203.0s)]
*  It's awesome. Great way to start your day. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=204.0s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=205.0s)]
*  It definitely changes my whole perception. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=206.0s)]
*  It kind of takes me out of my brain. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=208.0s)]
*  I notice and puts me into my body. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=211.0s)]
*  For sure. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=213.0s)]
*  I love it. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=214.0s)]
*  I just jump right in. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=215.0s)]
*  You're in it for. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=216.0s)]
*  I mean, I usually do like three, three to five minutes. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=217.0s)]
*  I'm ready to roll for the whole day. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=219.0s)]
*  Oh, really? [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=221.0s)]
*  That's about all I need. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=222.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=223.0s)]
*  I do like there's days like if I ever like a recovery day, because like most of the time, like I have to leave my house by 7 a.m. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=224.0s)]
*  I don't make it to meetings and stuff like that. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=229.0s)]
*  So and I don't really want to wake up. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=231.0s)]
*  I mean, six. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=232.0s)]
*  I don't like to wake up before six because as soon as you see like a five on your alarm clock, it sucks. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=233.0s)]
*  Yeah, there is something about that. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=238.0s)]
*  I think that makes you be like, oh, what's going on here? [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=239.0s)]
*  Like I'm a senior citizen or something. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=242.0s)]
*  Like they like that five. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=244.0s)]
*  You know, dude, it's here. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=246.0s)]
*  I was talking to Taylor one today. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=247.0s)]
*  He was a guy. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=249.0s)]
*  My workout started at five a.m. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=250.0s)]
*  I was like, why? [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=251.0s)]
*  That's great. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=252.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=253.0s)]
*  Why? [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=254.0s)]
*  Especially if you're just going to get hurt every year and not even play. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=255.0s)]
*  Oh, well, maybe it's new. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=258.0s)]
*  Maybe this is his change. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=260.0s)]
*  Maybe he's doing something different. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=261.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=262.0s)]
*  You know, hey, he'll be healthy, man. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=263.0s)]
*  He'll be fine. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=264.0s)]
*  He's got a couple of tough breaks. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=265.0s)]
*  It's what it is. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=267.0s)]
*  Yeah, it is. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=268.0s)]
*  Some of it, I think, is his attitude gets stuck in his knees to him. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=269.0s)]
*  Fucking ruins him. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=271.0s)]
*  There is something about when you get hurt, you definitely overthink about it, [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=272.0s)]
*  both from your recovery standpoint and then once you get back onto the football field, [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=276.0s)]
*  like that's all you can think about. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=279.0s)]
*  Like, just don't do it again. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=280.0s)]
*  Just don't do it again. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=281.0s)]
*  And the second you start thinking like that, that's when it happens again. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=282.0s)]
*  Have you noticed that? [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=284.0s)]
*  Because you had a what? [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=285.0s)]
*  You had a break, right? [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=286.0s)]
*  I broke my foot in 2020. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=287.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=288.0s)]
*  Q Boyd. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=289.0s)]
*  It's like up here. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=290.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=291.0s)]
*  And then I saw was I came back in five weeks and then the next like five practices. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=292.0s)]
*  Oh, that's all you could think about. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=296.0s)]
*  And it sucks. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=298.0s)]
*  And then you go through a whole off season and then you kind of forget about it. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=299.0s)]
*  But still you get back into football. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=301.0s)]
*  That's still what you're thinking about. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=302.0s)]
*  Like, just don't break it again. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=303.0s)]
*  And then like after a while, you just get comfortable and you just forget about it. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=304.0s)]
*  Were there routes and stuff that you would adjust and not do because you just to take the pressure off of it? [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=307.0s)]
*  Just like planting really hard on it. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=313.0s)]
*  It kind of just freaked me out a little bit because the way I broke it too, didn't really make any sense. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=314.0s)]
*  I just kind of got hit when my foot was in the ground and it just kind of gave out. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=318.0s)]
*  So I was just kind of more cautious, more careful, like picking up my feet when I was getting hit and stuff like that. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=321.0s)]
*  But then like it's a bone. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=326.0s)]

*  But like now I enjoy doing it because I feel great when you get done with it. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=371.0s)]

*  But he's also like he like dresses like he's trying to get molested. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=407.0s)]
*  I feel like. Is that a crazy thing to say? [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=412.0s)]

*  He smells like a barbershop to every time. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=416.0s)]
*  But I think that I think is in the urban community. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=418.0s)]
*  There's a lot better. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=421.0s)]
*  They tend to be a lot more fragrant. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=423.0s)]
*  Yeah, you're not wrong. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=426.0s)]
*  Jeremy smells good all the time. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=427.0s)]
*  I do. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=428.0s)]
*  I always say we got under skin sometimes we always tell him that he needs to brush his teeth once in a while, which he does. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=429.0s)]
*  But it's just it's a fun way to talk shit to somebody because not really much you can do if your breath smells like shit. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=433.0s)]
*  Oh, does his breath smell bad? [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=438.0s)]
*  No, it's just a fun joke that we play on him because there's not really much of a comeback to that. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=439.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah, that's true. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=443.0s)]

*  You're like, hey, do I really need my breath really bad? [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=446.0s)]
*  That's what people always do. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=448.0s)]
*  That's literally what it is. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=449.0s)]
*  Well, that is the best. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=450.0s)]
*  The worst thing is, is when somebody does have horrible breath and especially like if they're at like a nightclub or something and somebody's breath is bad. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=452.0s)]
*  Brutal. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=459.0s)]
*  Oh, and you know what? [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=460.0s)]
*  A lot of times, bro, I won't tell him, dude, depends on if I like him or not. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=462.0s)]
*  I feel you. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=465.0s)]
*  You got to be honest with like. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=466.0s)]
*  If it's a buddy, I'll definitely tell him. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=467.0s)]
*  But if it's somebody. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=469.0s)]
*  So if you've got a friend who has something in their teeth, you tell him. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=470.0s)]
*  Not if it's a girl. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=473.0s)]
*  So, OK, get this. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=475.0s)]
*  I was at the Pro Bowl two years ago and one of the reporters there, I'd like I was kind of going down the line to talk to a certain amount of people. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=476.0s)]
*  And I she probably interviewed like six people before she got to me and she just had a huge like piece of spinach in her front to teeth. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=484.0s)]
*  And I was like, you were just on air with six people and no one told you you have a camera guy with four feet from your face. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=491.0s)]
*  I told her when I started the interview, I was like, you have some of your teeth. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=496.0s)]
*  I was like, I don't know. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=499.0s)]
*  I would be so embarrassed if I just had some of my teeth the entire time and no one told me like, come on, I thought we were friends and women that shakes them to the core. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=500.0s)]
*  It's almost like telling them they don't even exist. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=508.0s)]
*  I know that sounds crazy, but you tell a woman because it's like for some reason it seems to be the only thing they care about. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=512.0s)]

*  Those guys like it because I think their Japanese feet are very little. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=651.0s)]
*  Do you could eat probably a dozen of them? [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=657.0s)]
*  And I know for context, that makes sense to me. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=660.0s)]
*  Sure. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=662.0s)]
*  Yeah, totally. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=663.0s)]
*  Okay. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=664.0s)]
*  It's like on a wind stop. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=665.0s)]
*  Get 10 piece bone in or bone out, man. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=666.0s)]
*  Oh, I think if you're going Japanese feet, you don't keep in the bone and I want all of it. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=669.0s)]
*  I think I want the mayor. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=674.0s)]
*  I want all the frickin, you know, the gifts of the Orient. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=675.0s)]
*  I feel like. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=678.0s)]
*  But I do think that that that is what it is. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=679.0s)]
*  They don't have very long. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=682.0s)]
*  It's not like a precious like a thing over there. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=684.0s)]
*  It's almost like, you know, it's so they don't get to see it. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=687.0s)]
*  So I think for them seeing like a long foot with toenail polish and stuff, it's very fantastical to them. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=692.0s)]
*  My Emma's fiance, Cody, he's a pitcher in Japan. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=698.0s)]
*  And so he's like six, five. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=703.0s)]
*  And he says that the next closest person hardly goes to his chest. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=705.0s)]
*  And so he just stands out like a sore thumb. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=709.0s)]
*  And I was like, that's actually crazy. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=712.0s)]
*  So then you think about feet like he's a size 14, 15. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=713.0s)]
*  That's that's that's a lot for that's a lot out there. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=716.0s)]
*  Yeah, he should. We'll get the picks up there for him. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=720.0s)]
*  And I think this. Yeah, I don't know if there's a market for it for men. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=722.0s)]
*  Yeah. What is going on with that foot? [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=725.0s)]
*  Why do people have foot fetish? [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=727.0s)]
*  Can you look it up, please? [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=729.0s)]
*  I'm going to call into your show and ask you that question. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=730.0s)]
*  But you came here and asked it. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=734.0s)]
*  I know, but I'll just call in next time. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=736.0s)]
*  Hey, man, this is George. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=738.0s)]
*  I was there a couple of weeks ago. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=739.0s)]
*  You solve this mystery yet? [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=741.0s)]
*  Oh, one researcher proposes that the fetish is due to sensory input in the brain. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=743.0s)]
*  The neuroscientist, the lie on her Ramar Shondra. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=748.0s)]
*  Yeah, suggest that the part of the brain that process is this sensation [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=753.0s)]
*  people get from feet is next to the area that perceives genital stimulation. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=757.0s)]
*  Oh, interesting. Right on. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=761.0s)]
*  So people want to see that foot. They want to get some going. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=764.0s)]
*  Gets the blood going. Yeah, I think I have this exact same thing. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=767.0s)]
*  You do? Yeah, it's a nice one. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=770.0s)]
*  The legacy flag guy made it for you? [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=771.0s)]
*  I think so. Yeah, he hit me up like four years ago and he made it for me. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=773.0s)]
*  I was like, dude, thanks. Yeah, it's hanging in my house. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=775.0s)]
*  It's in my barn. Oh, that's awesome. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=777.0s)]
*  I love it. Yeah. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=779.0s)]
*  We are. He sent us this one and another one. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=780.0s)]
*  We'll have to we'll put his info up actually right now. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=783.0s)]
*  He's done so much. He does beautiful flags. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=786.0s)]
*  So I'm going to make sure that we put it on the screen. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=788.0s)]
*  There's nothing like a cool wooden American flag. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=790.0s)]
*  It's awesome. Like Nick Bosa has. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=792.0s)]
*  I'm pretty sure that exact same one in the back of his locker. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=794.0s)]
*  Oh, wow. It's awesome. Oh, really? [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=796.0s)]
*  In his locker? Yeah, it's in the back of his locker. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=798.0s)]
*  I think I shipped there and he was like, this is cool. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=800.0s)]
*  And just set it back there. Oh, that's crazy. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=802.0s)]
*  But yeah, I guess that makes sense about a foot because I think also if you think back into maybe [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=804.0s)]
*  I wonder if like in old times you could. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=809.0s)]
*  But if people were like cave people, then you saw the foot all the time, you know? [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=812.0s)]
*  Very true. I'm just trying to think. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=816.0s)]
*  They weren't really pretty back then, though, were they? [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=818.0s)]
*  No, I'm sure. Kind of like hobbit feet. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=820.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah. I'm sure they were very. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=822.0s)]
*  Thick, muscular. I bet you they were spread out, though. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=825.0s)]
*  Yeah, very flat, huh? Flat, wide toes. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=828.0s)]
*  I mean, like because you see the photos like indigenous people and their feet, they're literally like they look like hands. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=831.0s)]
*  Yeah. Oh, my gosh. It's crazy. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=837.0s)]
*  And then I'm like, everyone's like, that's the healthy way. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=839.0s)]
*  That's what your feet want to look like. Your shoes make you, you know, they close your toe box in all that stuff. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=841.0s)]
*  Well, it's kind of hard for me because my profession, I have to wear cleats that are small and. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=846.0s)]
*  Oh, you got to keep them tight, huh? [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=850.0s)]
*  To an extent, like I tried, like I wear the toe space. I try to spread them out, keep my feet as healthy as I can. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=852.0s)]
*  But like once you get to training camp and you're I mean, you're taking like a couple hundred reps a day, it doesn't really help too much. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=855.0s)]
*  Like your feet just got to get you got to build a callus to it basically is what you do. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=862.0s)]
*  But then now I'm out of cleats right now for a couple of weeks and it's like your feet just lose that callus. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=865.0s)]
*  I have to get back into it every single year. It's wild. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=869.0s)]
*  Your feet kind of relax. Can you almost notice it and feel it? [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=872.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah. Like my feet feel significantly better a month after the season than they do the entire duration. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=875.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's wild. Yeah, like I don't. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=880.0s)]
*  This is a I learned this because I like pedicures. It feels fantastic. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=882.0s)]
*  Oh, I like getting my feet massaged. It's really nice. Get them cleaned up. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=885.0s)]
*  But like in the season, I don't get a pedicure for the entire season because I don't want to lose any of the callus. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=889.0s)]
*  Like on the bottom of my feet, I don't want any of it scraped off because your feet basically become these thick blocks. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=893.0s)]
*  And you just got to especially like where I am. I'm in the interior office. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=898.0s)]
*  I'm in the office of line basically all the time. And so I get stepped on 24 seven. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=901.0s)]
*  So like I like having tough feet. But then as soon as the season's over, I'm back in pedicures and stuff. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=905.0s)]
*  It's fantastic. So you want to keep whatever you can and whatever a little extra you can get. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=909.0s)]
*  Yeah, as like I hopefully I my skin is thicker about half way through the season. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=913.0s)]
*  Dang. It's wild. Do you all take stuff that can make your skin thicker? [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=917.0s)]
*  I don't know. Like, I mean, like we have a lot of supplements that are like our team provides us. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=921.0s)]
*  And I'm just big. I do a ton. I like collagen. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=926.0s)]
*  Like that's my big thing, collagen and orange juice and then any type of calcium I can get. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=929.0s)]
*  Like those are my two big things. But that's a good thing to look into. Why not? [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=934.0s)]
*  I mean, like you see, like my shins right here. That's just all cleats. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=937.0s)]
*  Oh, dang. Yeah, like my shins are just permanently cut up for like my the rest of my life. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=940.0s)]
*  Damn. Cleats aren't really fun to get kicked by. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=944.0s)]
*  Yeah. And do you get to wear shin pads or not? [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=947.0s)]
*  So the only guy that ever did that, I'm pretty sure it's like Cam Newton did that for a little bit. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=950.0s)]
*  I I contemplated doing that. But I like football is a really weird sport where you just got to get lucky. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=954.0s)]
*  Like I could be blocking somebody and then the running back could miss me by like an inch or he might kick me in the calf when he's going past me. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=959.0s)]
*  It's just like you just got to get lucky sometimes. And I got really lucky this year where like, yeah, my shins were getting beat up, but like nothing else. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=966.0s)]
*  And so I don't know if I want to be that guy that's out there with the double elbow pads, double knee. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=972.0s)]
*  Like you just don't want to look like that. And I just I can't bring myself to wear shin pads yet. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=977.0s)]
*  Yeah, there's maybe an aesthetic thing about it. Does it? [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=981.0s)]
*  But Cam Newton was the guy that did it? [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=984.0s)]
*  I think so. I think that's what because I brought it up and like one of my equipment managers told me that. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=987.0s)]
*  And I was like, if the only other person where shin guards was a quarterback, I just don't know if I can do that to myself. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=991.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah, because it kind of puts you on a different level. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=996.0s)]
*  Yeah, I know. I think I just got to tough it out. You know, it's it's for the it's just for the sport, man. It's got to tough it out. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=998.0s)]
*  Yeah, I could respect that, man. I think sometimes you want to wear like I won't wear like a turtleneck, you know, not a big turtleneck. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=1004.0s)]
*  I don't know if I've ever worn a turtleneck. I think there are guys that pulled off really well. That's just not my thing. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=1011.0s)]
*  You know who wears one? Mike Dick wears a turtleneck a lot. I see a lot. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=1017.0s)]
*  And I think a lot of people that sell jewelry wear it. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=1020.0s)]
*  Oh, like little fancy. You might see one like on a cool night in Miami. A lot of turtlenecks down there. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=1023.0s)]
*  Yeah, maybe I can see that kind of that's all of a. Yeah, I think it's kind of like also like Europeans or Middle Easterners wear it. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=1029.0s)]
*  Now there's Cam. Now that definitely looks like diapers on the front of his fucking. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=1035.0s)]
*  Yes, those are those. That's basically like basketball players where that's the type of shin guards. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=1038.0s)]
*  So like those aren't bad. Like I was pictured wearing like the actual soccer shin guards that are like hard ones. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=1043.0s)]
*  And who knows? I might give it a shot this year. Who knows if it doesn't affect how I run, which hopefully it doesn't. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=1048.0s)]
*  But you want to be as light as you can, because I mean, the name of the game in the NFL these days is speed. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=1053.0s)]
*  Yeah. So whoever's fastest is who makes the most plays and who gets paid. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=1057.0s)]
*  And it's also I think it could be become a mental thing. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=1061.0s)]
*  Like sometimes you feel like if you have something on your body, then it's way or it's like it starts to become a little bit of a hinge. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=1066.0s)]
*  And it's not even worth it, I bet. No, that's a hundred percent true because like I do use I play with the shoulder sling on because it was my second year. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=1071.0s)]
*  I dislocated my shoulder. And so like to come back and play and not miss any time I had like I wore the shoulder sling. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=1079.0s)]
*  And now I'm just like superstitious about it. And like I saw like my shoulders are a little messed up. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=1084.0s)]
*  But like I don't need to wear it. But I literally just do it because it's helps me like just not totally get out of the socket sometimes. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=1089.0s)]
*  And but for that, that that took a lot of getting used to just wearing something else in my body. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=1097.0s)]
*  Because at first I was like, well, I can't lift my hand above my head. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=1101.0s)]
*  And then after I just get used to it and that's it. That's the whole process of it. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=1103.0s)]
*  Just getting used to it because you know, like the football, like the girdles that come with like the built in pads and like your thighs and your hips and stuff like that. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=1106.0s)]
*  It's like spandex you'd wear. Yeah. I've seen them. Yeah. Like big panties. Yeah. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=1114.0s)]
*  Basically, they have these thick pads and I'm in. I wore them in high school and then I didn't wear them again until I tried them on the NFL. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=1117.0s)]
*  And it felt like I was wearing like baggy pants and I hated it. It was just way too much going on. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=1123.0s)]
*  And so I just do like the little like those high school white little pads you put into your football pants because like it is you just you don't want to wear a lot because you're just trying to be as fast as possible. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=1127.0s)]
*  You know, one thing that was interesting, even when your when your sister was helping me do yoga and I just bring that back because we would talk about you sometimes. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=1136.0s)]

*  And so I just went to a barber. [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=1590.0s)]
*  And what I've realized now is that when you have long hair, you need to go to a salon and like work with someone who knows how to cut long hair. [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=1592.0s)]
*  I just went to a barber and I swear to God, he gave me a bowl cut without putting a bowl on my head. [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=1598.0s)]
*  He let my hair down and he just cut a circle around my head. [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=1604.0s)]
*  And I looked at it and I was like, that's tough for me. [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=1606.0s)]
*  It's really tough. [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=1610.0s)]
*  And I had to go to a salon literally like an hour later and they had to like fix it for him. [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=1611.0s)]
*  But it was still a brutal, he just went scissors in a circle. [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=1614.0s)]
*  It hurts, huh? [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=1618.0s)]
*  It really, it was a struggle for me. [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=1619.0s)]

*  She was like, what is wrong with you? [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=1621.0s)]

*  I could see why Native Americans would go and take the scalp of a man [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=1632.0s)]
*  because it was like the most powerful fucking thing you could do. [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=1635.0s)]

*  That's a homeless guy. [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=1648.0s)]
*  Dude, he showed up and I asked him, you know, for a fade and he cut it. [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=1649.0s)]
*  And then he was on the back of my neck and he was talking to me and he was a football fan. [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=1655.0s)]
*  So he was talking and you know, like when you know, somebody messes something up and they try to hide it. [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=1659.0s)]
*  And like, it was like, and I was like, he stopped for like two seconds. [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=1665.0s)]

*  It was absolutely brutal. [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=1677.0s)]
*  Why did he do it? [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=1679.0s)]

*  And so those first year on draft pick, Matt and I get paid till after year four. [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=2452.7400000000002s)]
*  Um, but they already got a, you know, first year on signing bonus. [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=2456.46s)]
*  So like they're doing well for themselves. [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=2459.06s)]
*  Do you think it like, as a player gets into that year where it's like, okay, the [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=2461.18s)]
*  next year they're going to get paid, is it common where guys will kind of, and [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=2464.86s)]
*  it, maybe this is an overall question I was trying to ask earlier, where you'll. [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=2469.02s)]
*  Do you feel like, oh, as overall, as the league that the players, everybody's [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=2473.42s)]
*  almost like, all right, let's don't go too crazy here today so that we could [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=2477.62s)]
*  all play again next year. [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=2480.62s)]
*  There is a, I would say a majority of the NFL. [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=2481.9s)]
*  Like, um, yeah, a high majority of the NFL is not trying to hurt other players. [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=2485.7s)]
*  I think you have a couple of crazy guys that don't care if they do. [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=2490.98s)]
*  Like, I don't think their intention is I'm trying to blow your knee out. [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=2493.4199999999996s)]
*  I don't think that's a thing really anymore, but I definitely like there, [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=2496.22s)]
*  there are some guys who are more conscious about it than other guys. [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=2499.8199999999997s)]
*  And like, there's hits that you can't avoid and it is what it is. [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=2501.98s)]
*  But, um, yeah, I think I was like, I've had a time. [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=2504.7799999999997s)]
*  I was in my third year is like week 15 and I've been healthy the entire year. [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=2507.66s)]
*  And I'm Larry. [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=2513.66s)]
*  I'm there's a pile right behind me and a guy and like my legs are pinned. [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=2514.46s)]
*  And if a guy wanted to, he could have like, Larry just thrown me backwards. [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=2518.1s)]
*  It's going to be a really awkward fall for me. [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=2520.98s)]
*  It said, like, he grabbed me and pulled me out of the way. [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=2522.62s)]
*  He's like, dog, you're worth too much to do that. [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=2524.74s)]
*  And I was like, I really appreciate you. [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=2526.74s)]
*  Thank you so much. [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=2528.06s)]

*  kind of how I am too. [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=2533.8599999999997s)]
*  Like I never want to hurt anybody. [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=2534.46s)]
*  Like I cut block, you know, I have to, like, how do you expect? [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=2535.42s)]
*  Oh, I'll do it at the fucking mall, dude. [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=2538.54s)]
*  You just dive at a dude's ankles. [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=2540.9s)]
*  Put your head through his kneecap. [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=2543.2999999999997s)]
*  You do it like, and there's like there that's football, right? [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=2544.46s)]
*  Like, and people want to outlaw certain things. [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=2546.98s)]
*  Like I like the try not to hit them in the head. [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=2548.66s)]
*  Like I appreciate that. [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=2550.7799999999997s)]
*  Like I don't want to get in the head a lot. [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=2551.94s)]
*  It sucks. [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=2553.3399999999997s)]
*  Concussions aren't fun, but yeah, just getting ahead in the head. [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=2554.66s)]
*  But in general, like just kind of sucks. [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=2558.8199999999997s)]
*  So like guys are conscious about that. [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=2560.1s)]
*  I like the protection of the house, but like there's certain jobs, like [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=2561.22s)]
*  there's certain jobs, like, Hey, I'm going to cut block you and I'm going [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=2564.18s)]
*  to hit in the knees and you know, I, I don't like try to hurt anybody through it, [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=2566.62s)]
*  but like just, it's a part of the game. [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=2569.8599999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=2571.3399999999997s)]
*  So it's kind of weird. [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=2572.02s)]
*  But like I said, it's violence that's appreciated by everybody. [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=2573.14s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=2576.54s)]
*  I think that's true. [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=2576.8599999999997s)]
*  The, so you have to, does it almost start to feel like wrestling then at [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=2577.58s)]
*  some point late in the league? [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=2581.3399999999997s)]
*  Like, or like, to an extent, like there's, there's a lot, like there's, [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=2582.3799999999997s)]
*  yeah, I would say to an extent, like I would say there's a handful of us out [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=2586.3399999999997s)]
*  there who are treating it like wrestling too, and like, you know, having [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=2589.66s)]
*  fun out there like that, but, uh, yeah, I mean, everyone's just, everyone's out [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=2591.94s)]
*  there, everyone wants it, like everyone's goal is to win a super, I mean, I hope [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=2595.94s)]
*  everyone's goals to win a Superbowl. [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=2598.7s)]
*  Like that's what my goal is. [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=2599.8199999999997s)]
*  And then whatever comes with that, but like, I'm not going to go out of my way [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=2600.82s)]
*  to like, you know, to inflict too much pain on somebody, but enough. [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=2603.54s)]
*  Right. [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=2606.7000000000003s)]
*  Right. [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=2607.78s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=2608.1000000000004s)]
*  Cause I think, yeah, I wonder if it used to be different, you know, [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=2608.26s)]
*  I think back in the day, they cared less about each other, but there's a lot more [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=2611.42s)]
*  going on back then, like a lot of, did you, did you ever see the clip of, it [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=2616.06s)]
*  was on Instagram, but it was like the 1980, maybe like 1990 highlight for [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=2619.3s)]
*  like MB or CBS Monday, like a Sunday football or something like that. [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=2624.6600000000003s)]
*  And like the whole highlight video is just like guys getting their knees taken [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=2629.02s)]
*  out, guys getting thrown onto their heads, like just getting smoked and like [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=2632.3799999999997s)]
*  every, every highlight in that, like cut up is illegal in today's game, which [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=2635.74s)]
*  is crazy, but guys used to get messed up back in the day, but then you have to [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=2640.1s)]
*  take in like, are the guys that played in the, if you play in the NFL, you're [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=2643.66s)]

*  Like you played at a high level, you played with the best, but like the [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=2649.8999999999996s)]
*  game in the eighties and even the nineties is way different than it is [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=2653.1s)]
*  today, like just the athletes too. [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=2655.7s)]
*  Like you got guys out there running four, two forties, like left and right [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=2657.1s)]
*  in the eighties, you might've had one guy in the whole NFL that could do that. [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=2660.22s)]
*  But now it's like every team has three guys. [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=2663.38s)]
*  It's just crazy how the game's evolved. [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=2665.62s)]
*  And now like, look at like, you guys see guys like Miles Garrett, that [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=2667.02s)]
*  dude's six, five, 280 pounds and he's just muscle with 5% body fat. [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=2669.8199999999997s)]

*  entire NFL, but like now the guys that look like that are everywhere. [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=2683.9s)]
*  I have like five guys in my locker room that if they wanted to, if they punch me [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=2688.58s)]

*  January, February, March. [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=2742.3399999999997s)]

*  But so you report in July 24th and my season technically ended on January 29th. [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=2747.4199999999996s)]
*  That's a long season. [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=2753.18s)]
*  Right. [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=2755.22s)]
*  Okay. [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=2755.8599999999997s)]
*  So you have five months off. [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=2756.1s)]
*  Ish, but like we have spring football that starts April 15th and that's two months. [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=2757.74s)]
*  Oh dang. [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=2761.5s)]
*  What do you have to do there? [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=2762.1s)]
*  Uh, it's not, it's not as much contact, but you're just the first like two [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=2763.06s)]
*  weeks is just working out, like getting you into shape and you have to be there. [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=2766.74s)]
*  Uh, it's [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=2770.58s)]
*  physically you can zoom. [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=2771.5s)]
*  No. [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=2772.1400000000003s)]
*  So, uh, it's, it's not mandatory. [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=2772.42s)]
*  One of those things, like they want you there. [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=2776.0200000000004s)]
*  Um, some guys have workout bonuses in their contracts, so they can only [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=2778.38s)]
*  miss so many days, but like their coaches want you to be there. [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=2781.1800000000003s)]
*  If you're a vet, like there's going to be like Trent Williams probably won't show [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=2784.34s)]
*  up, you know, for a couple of weeks. [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=2787.2200000000003s)]
*  Cause like, he doesn't really need to get better at football, not going to lie. [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=2788.3s)]
*  Like he's probably the best football player in the NFL. [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=2791.46s)]
*  Okay. [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=2793.7000000000003s)]
*  It's our office of lineman or left tackle, but like there's certain guys that [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=2793.94s)]
*  don't do OTAs, um, but it's really beneficial for young guys. [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=2796.82s)]
*  Cause you just learn the playbook. [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=2801.1s)]
*  You go through the meeting. [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=2802.3399999999997s)]
*  It's kind of like, uh, if you haven't really been in the NFL too much, it's [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=2803.1s)]
*  kind of like a, just it's a bootcamp for the season just kind of gets you ready [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=2806.14s)]
*  for it and like, there's a, there's one week that's mandatory at the end of it [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=2810.58s)]
*  that everybody has to go to or you get signed, but it's not mandatory. [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=2813.3399999999997s)]

*  partners and then after that, I did like a 10 day vacation with my wife. [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=2836.18s)]
*  Cause I was like, I haven't gone on vacation in seven months. [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=2839.7s)]
*  So I'd like to go see a beach. [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=2841.9s)]

*  It is beautiful. [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=2851.02s)]
*  I wish it wasn't as expensive as it is, but like, I get it, but like, I don't [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=2851.58s)]
*  know, like there's a beautiful place in the world that I haven't been, but that's [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=2855.98s)]
*  one of my favorite places. [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=2858.86s)]
*  Like you're in the ocean and there's just massive islands that look like they [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=2859.7000000000003s)]
*  could move at any second and wreck havoc. [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=2862.78s)]
*  Like that's how I see them. [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=2865.42s)]

*  Yeah. [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=2873.46s)]
*  You're thinking like that. [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=2873.82s)]
*  That's how I view it. [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=2874.78s)]
*  I'm like that. [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=2875.6600000000003s)]
*  Is that like a giant Pokemon? [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=2876.7000000000003s)]
*  Is that going to stand up and come over here, dude? [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=2878.1000000000004s)]
*  Like that stuff freaks. [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=2879.86s)]
*  Like that's what I think about when I'm out there. [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=2880.78s)]
*  I'm like, wow, I'm just chilling right now. [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=2882.1800000000003s)]
*  I know, right? [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=2884.54s)]
*  I'm a 13 year old kid, Theo. [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=2886.1800000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=2887.66s)]
*  It seems like that. [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=2888.22s)]
*  It seems like you're just kind of like living in these crazy adult, like dream [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=2889.02s)]
*  worlds of a child, but that you're actually getting to navigate through them. [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=2892.18s)]
*  Um, so, so what about that extra bi-week? [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=2896.06s)]
*  So you, oh yeah, sorry. [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=2899.2999999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=2900.3399999999997s)]
*  Bi-week. [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=2900.54s)]
*  So it's okay. [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=2900.98s)]
*  I'll say this season, like January, let's say July 24th, right? [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=2901.62s)]
*  And you're like fully practicing, let's just say July, like the first couple [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=2905.02s)]
*  of days are pretty easy, but like by August 1st, you're going full speed go [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=2908.7799999999997s)]
*  from August 1st until if you're in the playoffs or like a Superbowl, like it's [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=2914.38s)]
*  mid February, so like your body's just rolling and getting beat up and so, and [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=2918.94s)]
*  then last two years ago, they added a 17th game. [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=2923.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=2927.02s)]
*  Who did that? [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=2927.1s)]
*  The money people? [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=2927.7400000000002s)]
*  You know what? [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=2928.86s)]
*  I voted no on it, but it is what it is. [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=2929.7400000000002s)]
*  It just, it was. [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=2932.06s)]
*  You guys just vote count? [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=2932.7000000000003s)]
*  Uh, well, so there was, um, like it was the new CBA, uh, the bargaining agreement [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=2934.06s)]
*  and they put in how I understand it and how it was explained to me is like, they [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=2939.7s)]
*  kind of just put the 17th game out there and as players are bored or like the [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=2944.42s)]
*  player voted reps, we're like, no, we're not going to do that. [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=2948.98s)]
*  And then when they finally gave us an offer, it was kind of like, you're [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=2952.1s)]
*  going to accept this or else. [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=2954.74s)]
*  And it somehow passed the voting process and then went to the players and it [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=2956.8199999999997s)]
*  wasn't, um, I don't know how well it was explained cause it was in the middle of [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=2960.74s)]
*  COVID too, so it was really hard to get ahold of people, like it was weird. [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=2964.8199999999997s)]
*  And that was like zoom zoom was just kind of getting along too. [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=2967.46s)]
*  So like, it was difficult to get a lot of people on a phone call. [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=2970.86s)]
*  I'm thinking about these 1500 guys in the league. [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=2974.46s)]
*  They were trying to do like league wide meetings. [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=2976.3s)]
*  Can you imagine 1500 people on a phone call? [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=2979.06s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=2981.54s)]
*  Like it, it, it was crazy. [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=2981.86s)]
*  And so like, it was difficult to get all the information out there. [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=2983.58s)]
*  So we voted and I, however many people voted, like there's a [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=2985.98s)]
*  possible like 1500 votes, only like 800 people voted out of the 1500 or something [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=2989.66s)]
*  like that and the thing it passed. [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=2994.62s)]
*  And so the 17th game was included now. [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=2997.06s)]
*  And so they added a 17th game. [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=2999.7s)]
*  And so this is all my theory is if you're going to add a game, so the [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=3001.58s)]
*  week, the season's 18 weeks long, because there's one by week for every team. [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=3004.98s)]
*  Right. [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=3008.42s)]
*  If you just add another bi-week and you give everybody two, it'll be a 19 week [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=3008.74s)]
*  season, there's more, there's more weeks of football, more money to be made. [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=3012.7s)]
*  And your best players are staying healthy. [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=3016.98s)]
*  So like, why not just do it? [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=3018.46s)]
*  It makes simple sense to me because, and you can just, I don't [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=3019.8599999999997s)]
*  like any player right now. [[00:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=3023.18s)]
*  If the NFL announced like, we're going to give everybody a second bi-week. [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=3024.5s)]
*  I don't think anybody would ever complain about that. [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=3027.7799999999997s)]

*  And the pop, everybody's standing up and cheering. [[01:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=3955.26s)]
*  Like that was one of the most exhilarating feelings I've ever had in my life. [[01:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=3957.42s)]
*  So like literally from that moment, I was like, I get why people wrestle. [[01:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=3960.06s)]
*  It is exhilarating when you get the crowd to go, Oh my gosh, literally it's so much [[01:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=3963.26s)]
*  fun. [[01:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=3969.6200000000003s)]

*  But he, he's a stud, but I would pick him. [[01:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=4019.62s)]
*  Now, if I was going to pick someone who I think would do like be a good WWE [[01:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=4022.7s)]
*  character, like a, be a really good WWE wrestler. [[01:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=4026.66s)]

*  Ends that are tight. [[01:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=4039.3399999999997s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=4041.3399999999997s)]

*  You're not wrong. [[01:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=4046.4199999999996s)]

*  Oh, I love women's, but I think that there is a, there's, I think, yeah, you [[01:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=4050.7799999999997s)]
*  could get a hold of my current profession. [[01:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=4056.22s)]
*  I play in tights as it is. [[01:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=4057.74s)]
*  So that's a good point. [[01:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=4058.98s)]
*  Yeah, I'm used to it, but no, like there are some great characters in the NFL who [[01:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=4060.06s)]
*  I think could make easy transitions over. [[01:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=4063.62s)]
*  I mean, you saw Gronk did it. [[01:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=4065.06s)]
*  Like he was at WrestleMania several years ago. [[01:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=4066.1s)]
*  But did he want it though? [[01:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=4068.46s)]
*  Gronk, I feel like gets, he, he like, he, he gets put in all like everything, you [[01:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=4070.1s)]
*  know, he's selling shave lotion. [[01:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=4074.06s)]
*  He's selling damn parkers or whatever. [[01:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=4075.54s)]
*  I saw him on a, um, somebody had him in a, uh, somebody was doing animals, selling [[01:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=4077.86s)]
*  puppies or whatever rescue animals or something. [[01:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=4085.2999999999997s)]
*  So I think, you know, he's almost does so many things. [[01:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=4087.34s)]
*  He does do a lot. [[01:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=4090.86s)]
*  And I was like, did he want it though? [[01:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=4091.74s)]
*  Like I could see you maybe becoming a member in it. [[01:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=4092.94s)]
*  Do you feel like you would just do it as a fun thing or do you feel like it could [[01:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=4096.78s)]
*  be something you would actually? [[01:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=4099.0599999999995s)]
*  I think I would have really enjoyed doing that. [[01:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=4101.259999999999s)]
*  Right now. [[01:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=4103.099999999999s)]
*  Like I will say like after meetings, like I've got the awesome opportunity. [[01:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=4103.7s)]
*  WWU is a fantastic company, like how they organize and run their stuff. [[01:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=4106.98s)]
*  Like I've got, I've gotten able to go, I've been able to go to like three [[01:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=4110.0599999999995s)]
*  WrestleMania's and this literally this last one, like the way they did it. [[01:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=4112.3s)]
*  It's ran, picked us up, picked me and my dad and one of my buddies up and my wife. [[01:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=4115.54s)]
*  We got to go backstage. [[01:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=4119.259999999999s)]
*  I got to hang out with the undertaker Stone Cold Steve Austin. [[01:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=4120.0599999999995s)]
*  I got to meet all these like people that I'm a huge fan of. [[01:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=4122.219999999999s)]
*  And then also wrestlers were like when they're behind the scenes, like they're [[01:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=4124.14s)]
*  just, they're normal, like I'm an NFL football player and people see me like, [[01:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=4127.46s)]
*  Oh my gosh, some like, some like kids are like, Oh my gosh, it's George Kittle. [[01:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=4130.26s)]
*  Like that's how I was a kid. [[01:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=4133.34s)]
*  Like NFL players are kind of superheroes. [[01:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=4134.22s)]
*  That's how kind of I am with wrestlers. [[01:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=4136.1s)]
*  I'm like, it's so cool. [[01:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=4137.42s)]
*  But as soon as you get them off the stage, they're just normal people. [[01:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=4138.26s)]
*  Like the rest of us. [[01:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=4140.740000000001s)]
*  So just like, just have a conversation with them. [[01:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=4141.860000000001s)]
*  They're all so cool. [[01:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=4143.26s)]
*  Like multiple guys are just hanging out with my dad, talking about random stuff [[01:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=4144.02s)]
*  and like being able to have that access is so much fun. [[01:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=4146.900000000001s)]
*  And so like, that's part of the reason that makes me really want to, you know, [[01:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=4149.34s)]
*  try it and I think I'd enjoy it. [[01:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=4152.3s)]
*  But I was sorry, I was going to say is like their schedule, like they're on the road. [[01:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=4153.780000000001s)]
*  320, 40 days. [[01:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=4157.9400000000005s)]
*  They don't get enough credit for their schedule. [[01:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=4159.740000000001s)]
*  Oh my gosh. [[01:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=4161.22s)]
*  Like if they're doing the, cause you, everyone you see Monday night raw, you see, [[01:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=4162.54s)]
*  I think AEW is on Wednesdays and then you have Friday night smack down. [[01:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=4167.1s)]
*  And then you have, if there's a pay-per-view, it's on Saturdays or Sundays. [[01:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=4170.5s)]
*  And then you don't even count the ones that aren't on TV. [[01:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=4173.700000000001s)]
*  There's like two non, non televised shows a week. [[01:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=4175.54s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=4179.34s)]
*  There's like AEW, there's a couple of other ones. [[01:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=4179.46s)]
*  But like, no WWE puts them on. [[01:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=4181.26s)]
*  They'll do like, they'll just go, they would like to Dubuque, [[01:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=4182.66s)]
*  Iowa and it won't be on TV, but it'll be in that area, whatever arena that is. [[01:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=4185.3s)]
*  Selling tickets and they're just selling tickets and putting on a show. [[01:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=4188.900000000001s)]
*  So it's for local shows. [[01:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=4190.860000000001s)]
*  And so it's a much smaller production than like the live TV ones. [[01:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=4191.820000000001s)]
*  But I've gone to a couple of those and they're still really fun. [[01:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=4194.66s)]
*  But it's just like this, they're, they're in the ring. [[01:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=4197.1s)]
*  Like I perform once a week. [[01:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=4199.58s)]
*  They're in the ring. [[01:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=4201.02s)]
*  And yes, there's a script to it, but like, you can't fake falling off, [[01:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=4202.18s)]
*  like getting thrown through a table. [[01:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=4206.740000000001s)]
*  You can't fake jumping off the top rope to the ground, which is a 10 foot fall. [[01:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=4207.9400000000005s)]
*  It's like, even if you went to Phantom of the Opera, but what if people are [[01:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=4210.94s)]
*  beating the fuck out of each other during it? [[01:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=4213.54s)]

*  I had, um, at the combine before my rookie year, I had to get like six MRIs in one [[01:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=4615.34s)]

*  I never had surgery on them. [[01:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=4628.06s)]
*  And so like, I've never really had shoulder problems. [[01:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=4629.26s)]
*  I can't throw a football very well. [[01:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=4630.9800000000005s)]
*  Um, but, uh, like the NFL teams wanted to see MRIs of them. [[01:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=4632.780000000001s)]
*  They wanted to get their own pictures. [[01:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=4636.02s)]
*  And so they put me in this, a smaller MRI machine and I had to sit like this and [[01:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=4637.42s)]
*  it was an hour and 45 minute MRI cause they did both shoulders at once. [[01:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=4642.02s)]

*  Like I was, I took, I sleep in my MRIs too, for some reason, the noise [[01:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=4647.620000000001s)]
*  that knocks me out, but I woke up with about 45 minutes left and I like, you [[01:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=4651.14s)]

*  I know he was like, wouldn't it be aggressive to do like a, like a hard [[01:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=4825.18s)]
*  psychedelic in that area, like being in that dark hole? [[01:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=4828.66s)]
*  Well, I think it was, I think it was like a nice enough room. [[01:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=4832.54s)]
*  I think it was the room was like about this. [[01:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=4834.98s)]
*  It was probably about 300 square feet. [[01:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=4836.34s)]

*  That's not for me. [[01:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=4843.139999999999s)]

*  Like I appreciate him for like, you know, good for you for wanting to try that. [[01:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=4846.5s)]
*  I don't know if I will ever do that, but. [[01:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=4849.74s)]
*  It's okay. [[01:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=4853.139999999999s)]
*  He was something. [[01:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=4853.58s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=4854.299999999999s)]
*  The depth, I think it was about like a site depravate or like just like what [[01:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=4854.66s)]
*  would happen if you don't, if you're not without the stimulus, you know? [[01:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=4857.98s)]
*  Yeah, for sure. [[01:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=4861.219999999999s)]
*  And like, there's no phone, there's no communication with anybody else. [[01:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=4861.7s)]
*  Like you're literally alone with your thoughts. [[01:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=4864.0599999999995s)]
*  You're alone with your thoughts, which is see what your thoughts. [[01:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=4865.98s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=4868.259999999999s)]
*  It's just like cool for him. [[01:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=4868.339999999999s)]
*  Like, I don't know how old Aaron is, but he's been in the league for a long time. [[01:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=4869.62s)]
*  He's going to be in the hall of fame. [[01:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=4872.5s)]
*  Right? [[01:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=4873.9s)]
*  So it's just like, he has a super bowl. [[01:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=4874.54s)]
*  He has what I think he has multiple MVPs. [[01:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=4877.26s)]
*  Like he's a hall of famer. [[01:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=4879.42s)]
*  So like, do you want to continue to play football? [[01:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=4880.3s)]
*  He doesn't like, I mean, I like, I have to, it doesn't have to, if he doesn't want [[01:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=4882.58s)]
*  to, so it's like, do you, do I still want to do this? [[01:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=4886.7s)]
*  Like, do I still love the game that I, you know, that I grew up playing? [[01:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=4888.78s)]
*  And so, and I don't know if that's what his reasoning was, but like, I [[01:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=4891.38s)]
*  think that's what it would be. [[01:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=4894.42s)]
*  And so like, if that's what you want to do, like to get along with your thoughts, [[01:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=4895.74s)]
*  I, like, I get that I'm not ready for that. [[01:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=4899.38s)]
*  Like I don't need that in my life right now, but hey, maybe when I'm 35, like, [[01:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=4901.42s)]
*  maybe that's something you want to do. [[01:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=4904.82s)]
*  So like, I'm not going to judge him for it. [[01:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=4906.82s)]
*  It's wild. [[01:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=4908.1s)]
*  And now I know about it and like, well, I have that in my back pocket. [[01:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=4908.62s)]
*  If I ever just want to disappear for four days. [[01:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=4911.1s)]
*  And it's brave of him kind of in a way to do it because a lot of guys are afraid to, [[01:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=4913.3s)]
*  I think, you know, I know he's friends with Aubrey Marcus and they, Aubrey's big [[01:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=4918.1s)]
*  into like a psychedelic medicines and like, um, just like templates of therapy [[01:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=4923.26s)]
*  and stuff like that, right? [[01:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=4929.06s)]
*  Huge into it. [[01:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=4930.1s)]
*  It's just different types of therapy. [[01:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=4931.22s)]
*  Oh, even all types of stuff like, like muscle, like, like even like being under [[01:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=4932.42s)]
*  the influence of certain things and then like doing certain things to your muscles, [[01:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=4938.02s)]
*  to release like memories, like, and this is like all I'm paraphrasing, but Aubrey's [[01:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=4941.3s)]
*  like deep into that world. [[01:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=4945.860000000001s)]
*  Right. [[01:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=4947.54s)]
*  And I think a lot of guys would be, especially at Aaron's level of popularity, [[01:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=4948.22s)]
*  he's famous, famous, right. [[01:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=4953.14s)]
*  Would be embarrassed to not embarrassed, but would probably feel uncomfortable [[01:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=4954.38s)]
*  talking about that kind of stuff. [[01:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=4957.860000000001s)]
*  He brought me, he brought it up and he talked about it like on the Pat McAfee [[01:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=4958.78s)]
*  show too, the boys love them, but like they, uh, they just to bring that up and [[01:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=4961.58s)]
*  like, and it's Aaron Rogers, like everything that he says on into the media, [[01:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=4965.82s)]
*  like everybody, it's a clip, like any, if he says anything out of, like out of line [[01:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=4969.62s)]
*  or kind of controversial, like that's a headline on hundreds of newspapers or [[01:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=4974.98s)]
*  like online, online newspapers. [[01:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=4979.22s)]
*  So it's just like for him to go out and say that and like, that was the only [[01:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=4981.1s)]
*  thing anyone talked about for the next three days. [[01:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=4983.46s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[01:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=4985.0199999999995s)]
*  It was crazy. [[01:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=4985.54s)]
*  All over social media, like the meme pages, everyone making fun of him for, [[01:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=4986.14s)]
*  but like for him to go out there and talk about it, like I didn't even know [[01:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=4989.02s)]
*  that was a thing and I'm kind of, that's cool. [[01:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=4991.02s)]
*  Like I, again, not for me right now, but, but in the future, who knows? [[01:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=4993.06s)]
*  Who knows? [[01:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=4996.58s)]
*  Like I might want to do that someday. [[01:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=4996.9800000000005s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=4998.34s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=4999.22s)]
*  They have all types of things like that. [[01:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=4999.38s)]
*  Like there's like a camp you can go to where no one talks for like a week [[01:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=5000.660000000001s)]
*  and then I think you can do like, you still interact with people. [[01:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=5004.42s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=5007.38s)]

*  Otherwise you'd just sit there going, [[01:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=5019.02s)]
*  otherwise you want to say you're into some fucking, you're like, [[01:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=5022.1s)]

*  I'm going to guess 36. [[01:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=5084.860000000001s)]
*  Okay. [[01:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=5085.9800000000005s)]
*  So he's getting to be at a point in his life. [[01:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=5086.66s)]
*  It kind of seemed like he's just, he seemed like he's definitely kind of a [[01:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=5088.18s)]
*  searcher kind of dude, you know? [[01:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=5091.860000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=5093.9400000000005s)]

*  Yeah. [[01:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=5097.18s)]
*  He's 39 years old. [[01:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=5097.38s)]
*  I will like, I think at his point, his, I mean, again, like I have no idea, [[01:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=5098.58s)]
*  but like at some point football is not the only thing in my life, right? [[01:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=5102.82s)]
*  Like I'm not just a football player. [[01:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=5106.26s)]
*  Like there's more sides of me than that. [[01:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=5107.7s)]
*  And I think he's been playing football since he was probably five, seven [[01:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=5109.0199999999995s)]
*  years old for the last 30 years. [[01:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=5112.74s)]
*  I bet she wants to find out like who else, like what other parts of me, [[01:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=5114.54s)]
*  like what else do I love as much as football? [[01:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=5118.18s)]
*  It's a good point, man. [[01:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=5120.54s)]
*  I think that that's, I think that probably happens for a lot of guys who [[01:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=5121.5s)]
*  get stuck into one or who start so young in something, but I think that's [[01:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=5125.98s)]
*  because then you're like, at some point you're like, as a, did I get put into [[01:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=5132.46s)]
*  this? Did I really, obviously I've loved this at certain points and it's been a [[01:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=5137.62s)]
*  great big part of my life, but are there other things? [[01:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=5141.1s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=5143.900000000001s)]
*  That I want to do that. [[01:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=5144.02s)]
*  I don't even, I'm so been so stuck in this vein that I don't even know what they are. [[01:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=5144.9800000000005s)]
*  Like you just, you missed it. [[01:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=5151.42s)]
*  You missed that window and like, granted, like, I don't know if he would, like I [[01:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=5152.5s)]
*  wouldn't trade my opportunity. [[01:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=5155.26s)]
*  Like I love playing football. [[01:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=5156.22s)]
*  Like who knows? [[01:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=5157.18s)]
*  Like there could be something else that like, I might've loved to do it if I [[01:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=5157.9800000000005s)]
*  just would have given it a shot. [[01:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=5160.34s)]
*  Like maybe I love the cross. [[01:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=5161.14s)]
*  Maybe if I like, uh, yeah, I mean like, what if I did that? [[01:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=5162.54s)]
*  Or like, what if I wanted to be the Brittany Griner of fucking lacrosse? [[01:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=5165.26s)]
*  I think, dude, you'd have been a fucking gangster. [[01:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=5168.3s)]
*  That's a fucking compliment. [[01:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=5171.02s)]
*  I appreciate it. [[01:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=5171.9800000000005s)]
*  Oh dude, you would have been insane in lacrosse, dude. [[01:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=5172.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=5175.02s)]
*  I saw it, but it wasn't offered where I lived. [[01:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=5175.26s)]
*  And so like, who knows? [[01:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=5176.820000000001s)]
*  Like I could have enjoyed that. [[01:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=5177.9400000000005s)]
*  Like, I don't know. [[01:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=5179.46s)]
*  So like maybe he's like, at some point you want to figure out what else, what [[01:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=5180.02s)]
*  else do you love? [[01:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=5183.06s)]
*  You know, I think that a lot about like some of my friends that are athletes that [[01:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=5183.9400000000005s)]
*  are black guys, actually, sometimes I think, cause a lot of young black men, they [[01:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=5186.94s)]
*  didn't have any other opportunities except for athletics. [[01:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=5190.5s)]
*  So I start to wonder sometimes like, if that's even a bigger thing in their [[01:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=5194.139999999999s)]
*  sometimes community or that you'll start to see like, because they didn't have [[01:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=5198.54s)]
*  any other choice or there weren't as many options to get, not as many outlets, [[01:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=5201.86s)]
*  right? [[01:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=5206.94s)]
*  Not as many outlets. [[01:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=5207.179999999999s)]
*  Like, I mean, and less opportunities too. [[01:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=5208.0599999999995s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=5209.82s)]
*  So it's like, damn, I wonder how many of those guys start to feel like, man, is [[01:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=5210.379999999999s)]
*  this something that I even wanted to even not wanted to do? [[01:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=5214.98s)]
*  Was it more like, do I love the game or is it like more of a my only choice? [[01:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=5219.0199999999995s)]
*  I had, that was my, like, that's what I had to do. [[01:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=5222.219999999999s)]
*  It's kind of interesting. [[01:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=5224.219999999999s)]
*  It is interesting. [[01:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=5225.0599999999995s)]
*  I think, I think, well, one, like football is really hard if you don't love it. [[01:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=5225.9s)]
*  Like it's really, cause like what you put your body through, what you put like [[01:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=5230.219999999999s)]
*  the stress levels through, like we put our, like, I know every, like our [[01:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=5232.9s)]
*  professions, like when you're out there, you know, for like to perform and like, [[01:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=5236.94s)]
*  that's how like people watch you and stuff like that. [[01:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=5239.7s)]
*  It's like, there's a stress that comes out because you could make one bad play. [[01:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=5241.86s)]
*  And like, that's the only thing everybody on Twitter is yelling at you for and [[01:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=5245.54s)]
*  telling you that you're a piece of shit. [[01:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=5248.5s)]
*  And so like, there's a, there's a mental stress to it. [[01:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=5249.62s)]
*  There's a physical stress to it. [[01:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=5251.66s)]
*  Time away from your family. [[01:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=5253.099999999999s)]

*  And I live in San Jose, California for seven months out of the year. [[01:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=5266.74s)]
*  So it's, it's wild. [[01:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=5270.5s)]
*  Because it's just, yeah, that's just, it blows me away. [[01:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=5271.9s)]

*  I'm always going to be gone. [[01:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=5282.0199999999995s)]
*  It's very hard for me to start a relationship with someone that I know I'm [[01:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=5282.94s)]
*  going to be able to upkeep, you know, it's like, um, I've already kind of written [[01:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=5286.54s)]

*  window of opportunity, right? [[01:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=5318.18s)]

*  Oh really? [[01:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=5390.22s)]
*  That's how I learned about it. [[01:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=5391.02s)]
*  Do you watch any UFC? [[01:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=5392.5s)]
*  A little bit. [[01:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=5393.9800000000005s)]
*  I'm involved with PFL, the professional fighters league. [[01:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=5394.5s)]
*  Oh, really? [[01:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=5398.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=5399.26s)]
*  Got into that a little bit. [[01:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=5400.1s)]
*  And they do what fighting it's the same thing. [[01:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=5401.26s)]
*  Yeah, it's the same thing. [[01:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=5403.14s)]
*  It's a kind of a tournament style though. [[01:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=5403.700000000001s)]
*  So like, it's like they have, so if you win the first round, you just move on [[01:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=5405.14s)]
*  to the second round, that's how they, that's how they decide who wins the belt. [[01:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=5407.740000000001s)]
*  Oh wow. [[01:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=5409.900000000001s)]
*  It's kind of cool. [[01:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=5410.540000000001s)]
*  It's on ESPN plus I think. [[01:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=5411.06s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=5412.42s)]
*  PSVM plus. [[01:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=5412.740000000001s)]
*  That seems a lot more almost realistic in the, what the value of the belt is. [[01:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=5413.46s)]
*  Yeah, that's what it's cool. [[01:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=5417.66s)]
*  I got, and I'm not like, I'm not huge in the UFC stuff. [[01:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=5418.9s)]
*  Like I'll watch like the big fights. [[01:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=5421.42s)]
*  Like I enjoy watching that. [[01:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=5422.74s)]
*  Um, do I don't follow it religiously like a lot of people do, but, um, I, I mean, [[01:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=5424.3s)]
*  I have the utmost respect for those people cause it's insane. [[01:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=5429.02s)]
*  Oh, it's crazy. [[01:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=5431.26s)]
*  Q like they, like that when they go into the ring, like when they flip the switch, [[01:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=5432.18s)]
*  there's no, like, there's no buffer. [[01:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=5437.02s)]
*  It's like, I'm trying to kill this person. [[01:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=5439.22s)]
*  Like in football, like it's, it's a little bit like you have that mindset to an [[01:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=5441.099999999999s)]
*  extent, but like they're actually in there until someone pulls them off of them. [[01:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=5444.74s)]
*  It's crazy to me. [[01:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=5448.38s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=5449.66s)]

*  Yeah. [[01:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=5451.38s)]
*  There's a, it's a different level of, um, of violence that you're willing to do. [[01:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=5451.58s)]
*  Um, we have a friend, Drake, you know, Drake, yeah, I just did his podcast. [[01:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=5456.42s)]

*  me of a mankind a little bit for sure. [[01:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=5473.42s)]
*  Dude, he's a psycho. [[01:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=5476.099999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=5477.219999999999s)]
*  Well, so here's a fun Drake story. [[01:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=5477.46s)]
*  Um, my senior day in college, he played fullback with me in Iowa. [[01:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=5479.46s)]
*  That's how I know him. [[01:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=5482.54s)]
*  Oh, that's how you guys know each other. [[01:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=5483.139999999999s)]
*  So also then like I was number 46, he was number 45. [[01:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=5484.339999999999s)]
*  And so our lockers are next to each other for like three or four years. [[01:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=5487.219999999999s)]
*  That's how they do it by numbers. [[01:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=5489.78s)]
*  And I, when they, and we got a new locker room or old locker room, it was like, [[01:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=5490.98s)]
*  you would go, uh, it was like one through 50 and then like every other number was [[01:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=5495.9s)]
*  51 through 99. [[01:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=5501.66s)]
*  And so like it'd be one and then it'd be 51 to 52. [[01:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=5503.98s)]
*  Oh, so like probably people, some people would quit because of that. [[01:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=5507.74s)]
*  It's confusing. [[01:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=5509.82s)]
*  It was weird. [[01:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=5510.42s)]
*  They're lockers, but like the new one is like one started here and it just kind [[01:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=5511.0599999999995s)]
*  of went around and so, yeah, so 45, 46, we're next to each other. [[01:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=5514.34s)]
*  So we became friends and then, uh, this past, oh, sorry, my senior day. [[01:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=5517.78s)]
*  Uh, so my fifth year senior were playing Nebraska and we beat the shit out of them [[01:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=5521.139999999999s)]
*  because, uh, Oh, cause of Wilcompton. [[01:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=5524.9s)]
*  Oh no. [[01:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=5526.9s)]
*  So he beat Iowa once. [[01:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=5527.54s)]
*  He was talks about that or something like that. [[01:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=5528.62s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=5530.0599999999995s)]
*  He's always talking about something, dude. [[01:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=5530.42s)]
*  He's always talks about something. [[01:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=5531.62s)]
*  It is what it is. [[01:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=5532.98s)]
*  It's cut. [[01:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=5533.58s)]
*  He looks like a premature baby on fucking pre-workout. [[01:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=5533.78s)]
*  Oh, well, that's funny. [[01:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=5539.0199999999995s)]
*  Well, he always looks a little premature. [[01:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=5543.0199999999995s)]
*  He like his eyes don't open all the way or something. [[01:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=5544.5s)]
*  That's really funny, dude. [[01:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=5549.38s)]
*  Wow. [[01:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=5550.86s)]
*  Well, that's tough for you, dog. [[01:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=5551.139999999999s)]

*  He's at fullback and I'm blocking somebody and I just hear a snap and I [[01:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=5566.14s)]

*  about this too, cause like I said, so she's in a family of four. [[01:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=6225.46s)]
*  I'm in a family of four. [[01:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=6228.22s)]
*  If me and her have four kids and we're a family of six, neither one of us has [[01:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=6229.58s)]
*  ever interact like we've had friends that have families like that, but like, [[01:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=6232.46s)]
*  I've never been responsible in a family of four kids. [[01:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=6235.14s)]
*  And so like, that'll be a whole new interaction for me. [[01:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=6237.86s)]
*  Like I've never been like, I've never, I'd never had a brother. [[01:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=6239.66s)]
*  So like, I know like I had cousins that are brothers. [[01:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=6242.66s)]
*  I have friends that are like brothers to me, but like, I never had an actual [[01:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=6244.58s)]

*  So 31 other teams are all dealing with some of the same shit. [[01:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=6406.86s)]
*  Yes. [[01:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=6409.18s)]
*  You can call almost anybody. [[01:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=6409.34s)]
*  Literally. [[01:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=6410.7s)]
*  It's really hard to win a Superbowl. [[01:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=6411.26s)]
*  So like, yeah, if you want to talk about it or stuff like that now, I don't think [[01:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=6412.34s)]
*  you really need to talk about it. [[01:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=6415.14s)]
*  It's just kind of like, you just got to get, you get, it just takes a couple of [[01:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=6415.9400000000005s)]
*  weeks, really like, like the first two to three weeks afterwards really suck. [[01:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=6418.780000000001s)]
*  But like now that I'm back in Nashville and like, I'm, like I said, I'm healthy [[01:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=6422.780000000001s)]
*  and I can train, it goes away pretty quick after that. [[01:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=6425.18s)]
*  But like the perspective probably starts to switch to the future a little bit. [[01:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=6427.62s)]
*  And also like if, and like, so my first two years, our team wasn't very good. [[01:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=6430.02s)]
*  And so like my, I didn't go to the playoffs. [[01:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=6433.9400000000005s)]
*  So like when your season ends in like December, it's, you're kind of like, all [[01:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=6435.62s)]
*  right. [[01:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=6439.58s)]
*  Well, yeah, it kind of, we suck this whole year, but like, you're also like, when [[01:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=6439.9s)]
*  you know, you're not in the playoffs. [[01:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=6443.34s)]
*  It's you, you're, you're like, you're playing for yourself and you've got to put [[01:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=6445.3s)]
*  yourself out there and like, you want to, like, you got to put good stuff on tape. [[01:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=6449.26s)]
*  Like you can't just give up, but like there are like, there's a, the energy [[01:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=6452.82s)]
*  changes, the energy changes and it's, it's harder to get like eating during the [[01:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=6456.66s)]
*  middle of the game and no, not like that, but no, I'm sorry, like just week to week. [[01:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=6460.06s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[01:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=6463.06s)]
*  Like, so like, if you're like an O and 19, like my rookie year, we started O and [[01:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=6463.38s)]
*  nine, not very fun, but like, and I was just, and [[01:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=6466.34s)]
*  I was learning, right. [[01:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=6469.5s)]
*  Not even a team. [[01:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=6470.3s)]
*  What do you even do? [[01:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=6470.98s)]
*  It was brutal, man. [[01:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=6473.1s)]
*  It was really fun though, but it was brutal. [[01:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=6474.62s)]
*  We had like 25 rookies on the active roster. [[01:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=6476.22s)]
*  It was, it was wild, but it was really fun. [[01:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=6478.5s)]
*  But like once the season ends, cause like you kind of like, all right, we're not [[01:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=6481.26s)]
*  going to make the playoffs. [[01:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=6484.66s)]
*  So like three weeks before, like your wife or like you're, like you're planning a [[01:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=6485.5s)]
*  vacation, so you're like, then you have something else to look forward. [[01:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=6489.06s)]
*  It's just, it's different than, than went, than going in the playoffs and like, [[01:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=6491.1s)]
*  Hey, we have like, Hey, I have an opportunity. [[01:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=6494.7s)]
*  We went the whole season. [[01:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=6496.54s)]
*  We're one of the, what, seven teams that make the playoffs on my side of the [[01:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=6497.78s)]
*  conference, like we have a shot to win and then it gets taken out from me. [[01:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=6501.46s)]
*  And then you're like, damn. [[01:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=6504.42s)]
*  But like, if you know, you're not going to be like, it's, it's just, it's two [[01:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=6506.7s)]
*  different things and I've experienced both. [[01:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=6508.900000000001s)]
*  And I think it's eat, like I'd rather win a bunch of games and then lose a [[01:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=6510.54s)]
*  heartbreaker, honestly, like winning 12 to 13 games is a lot more fun than [[01:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=6514.34s)]
*  losing 10 straight. [[01:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=6518.78s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[01:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=6520.06s)]
*  So like I'd rather do that. [[01:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=6520.74s)]
*  Like, and yes, but does it suck to lose at the end? [[01:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=6522.18s)]
*  For sure. [[01:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=6524.98s)]
*  It sucks a lot, but Hey, it's life. [[01:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=6525.54s)]
*  It is what it is. [[01:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=6528.0599999999995s)]
*  I'm just going to continue to grind and continue to be a good football player. [[01:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=6529.0599999999995s)]
*  Did you think when, when Brock Purdy came in, um, what it would be like, and [[01:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=6531.98s)]
*  there's a bee in here or something, not be, it's just a safe animal, but do you [[01:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=6535.9s)]
*  think it's just swirling? [[01:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=6540.0199999999995s)]
*  Oh yeah, it's probably if I hit it, will Peter get mad at me? [[01:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=6541.7s)]
*  I don't think so. [[01:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=6545.179999999999s)]
*  I don't even know who that is. [[01:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=6545.94s)]
*  You know what? [[01:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=6548.099999999999s)]
*  That honestly doesn't surprise me. [[01:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=6548.78s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=6550.099999999999s)]
*  It just, I'm so distracted by this. [[01:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=6550.7s)]
*  Oh, you got it. [[01:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=6553.66s)]
*  Oh, I'm going to put that outside. [[01:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=6554.38s)]
*  Okay. [[01:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=6556.7s)]
*  I was left. [[01:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=6557.34s)]
*  It's not bad. [[01:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=6558.74s)]
*  Somebody said Travis Kelsey can do that with a Falcon. [[01:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=6560.54s)]
*  Just saying this is what I've heard. [[01:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=6564.18s)]
*  Did you see the clip on Instagram of the dude that hunts with a Falcon? [[01:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=6569.86s)]

*  No, I'd cut him. [[01:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=6705.94s)]
*  I'd go right for his knees. [[01:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=6707.38s)]
*  Go right for the thing's knees and it's probably going to, it's going to knock my [[01:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=6709.74s)]
*  window out, give me a concussion, but I ain't going out like that, man. [[01:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=6712.5s)]
*  Holy God. [[01:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=6716.099999999999s)]
*  Dude, I'm taking it from the side. [[01:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=6717.82s)]
*  Like if I was a safety and that's the tight end crowd across the middle field, I'm [[01:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=6719.38s)]
*  going to take a creative angle and try to hit its back two legs, right at the [[01:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=6722.38s)]
*  ankles and take it out, spin it out. [[01:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=6725.0599999999995s)]
*  That's what I would do. [[01:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=6727.139999999999s)]
*  You can't take that thing on full. [[01:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=6728.54s)]
*  That's like tackling Derek Henry. [[01:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=6729.62s)]
*  Remember that you've seen people like stiff, like, you know, they're, they're [[01:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=6731.38s)]

*  That's what that would be like. [[01:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=6735.74s)]
*  That's you trying to tackle Derek Henry. [[01:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=6736.86s)]
*  I would do some other way to get him. [[01:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=6738.42s)]
*  You know, now what if you put lice in your field in the grass that got in his [[01:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=6739.78s)]
*  hair at halftime, he's itching too much. [[01:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=6743.54s)]
*  You can't hold on to the ball. [[01:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=6745.0599999999995s)]
*  Wouldn't that happen to you too though? [[01:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=6746.179999999999s)]
*  True, but you'd risk it. [[01:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=6748.139999999999s)]
*  I know, but maybe as a defensive player, I get that. [[01:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=6749.54s)]
*  Whoa. [[01:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=6752.54s)]
*  I'd be so, you just kind of think of a new strategy. [[01:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=6752.9s)]
*  Who wants to go tackle Derek Henry? [[01:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=6755.34s)]
*  No one that sounds off. [[01:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=6757.66s)]
*  You got to hit them before he gets the ball. [[01:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=6758.78s)]
*  I know he gets three steps going. [[01:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=6761.22s)]
*  He's three steps in, he's full speed and then that's, it's a 200. [[01:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=6763.02s)]
*  He's bigger than I am. [[01:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=6766.14s)]

*  I love Iuk. [[01:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=6989.9s)]
*  He's, he's just a different energy. [[01:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=6990.58s)]
*  Like you have these guys, like they're, they're selfless. [[01:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=6992.3s)]
*  It's like, if we're winning the game and, and like they're playing too, and like [[01:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=6994.7s)]
*  they're playing at a high, like they're running great routes. [[01:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=6999.22s)]
*  They're, you know, blocking at a high level too, but like they're doing everything. [[01:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7000.86s)]
*  We're doing everything we can. [[01:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7003.7s)]
*  So like, whether it's Chris McCaffrey or other running back, like Elijah [[01:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7004.98s)]
*  Mitchell, like to get them into the end zone, that's all I care about. [[01:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7007.38s)]
*  Like us winning games is all I care about. [[01:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7010.14s)]
*  And so like, yes, I love the personal accolades. [[01:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7011.7s)]
*  Like you, you want to build that resume, but I mean, I would, I, I would trade [[01:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7014.18s)]
*  about, yeah, I mean, I would, I'd rather win a Superbowl than I think this is an [[01:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7019.1s)]
*  argument I've had in the locker room before, like, would you rather win a [[01:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7023.18s)]
*  Superbowl or be in the hall of fame? [[01:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7025.02s)]
*  I think it would have to be the Superbowl as a fan. [[01:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7027.700000000001s)]
*  I don't even know who's in the hall of fame. [[01:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7031.06s)]
*  That's why I mean, I'd rather win a Superbowl than be in the hall of fame. [[01:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7032.54s)]
*  Now being in both, like both would be amazing, but like, if I had to pick one, [[01:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7034.66s)]
*  like, Hey George, you would rather win this or do that. [[01:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7038.62s)]
*  I'd pick an Assurbo 10 out of 10 times. [[01:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7040.38s)]
*  Do you think there are players that would rather get the ball more than win the game? [[01:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7042.34s)]
*  There are not on your team. [[01:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7047.660000000001s)]
*  Even though I'm trying to think, like, I think there are certain players that. [[01:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7051.58s)]
*  Like you have to have the mindset that when, like, when you get the ball, like [[01:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7056.780000000001s)]
*  the more, like you have to have a mindset. [[01:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7059.700000000001s)]
*  Like when I get the ball, it looks fucking scary. [[01:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7062.06s)]
*  Dude, it's not for everybody. [[01:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7064.740000000001s)]
*  And it is what it is. [[01:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7066.42s)]
*  Who me the ball, dude. [[01:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7067.1s)]
*  I'd throw it back. [[01:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7067.820000000001s)]
*  Nope. [[01:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7069.46s)]
*  Honestly. [[01:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7069.900000000001s)]
*  Hey. [[01:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7071.22s)]
*  Not me, not me. [[01:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7071.94s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7072.86s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7073.139999999999s)]
*  Not me. [[01:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7073.38s)]
*  I do a timeout. [[01:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7074.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7075.3s)]
*  I feel like you just toss a lot of bouncing. [[01:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7075.58s)]
*  Slip coach, my bad. [[01:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7078.7s)]
*  Just drop it. [[01:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7079.66s)]
*  I'm good. [[01:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7080.18s)]
*  No, but, um, I think, wow, that's a good question. [[01:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7081.22s)]
*  Um, there might be some guys that are like more like stat hungry maybe, but they're [[01:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7084.98s)]
*  not on our team. [[01:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7091.62s)]
*  I've never really been with a guy that was like that, which has been awesome. [[01:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7092.46s)]
*  Um, but like, and there's, there's guys who have contracts where like, Hey, if I [[01:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7095.22s)]
*  get 40 catches this season, I get a bonus. [[01:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7100.06s)]
*  Right. [[01:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7102.860000000001s)]
*  Like we had a guy who, um, we had a guy who he, he was a backup, right. [[01:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7103.22s)]
*  But he's resigned cause his rookie deal was over and he had an incentive in there [[01:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7108.46s)]
*  that was if he got over, he had to break his receiving yards from last year. [[01:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7111.42s)]
*  And he only had like 150 receiving yards, but he doesn't play a lot on offense. [[01:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7115.780000000001s)]
*  He's a special teams guy. [[01:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7118.660000000001s)]
*  And in, by like week five, he broke it. [[01:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7120.34s)]
*  And it was amazing cause he got, he got like a multiple hundred thousand [[01:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7124.580000000001s)]
*  dollar bonus because of it. [[01:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7127.42s)]
*  And so like, yeah, like there is a selfishness to it because who doesn't [[01:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7128.5s)]
*  want to get paid an extra $250,000 or something like that, whatever it was. [[01:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7131.86s)]
*  I'm not entirely sure, but like, that's awesome. [[01:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7134.94s)]
*  Like good for you. [[01:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7137.18s)]
*  And like, I'm encouraging like, Hey, Jimmy throwing the ball, Brock toss, [[01:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7137.66s)]
*  like the tray throw that guy the ball. [[01:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7142.58s)]
*  So it's just like, that's pretty fun. [[01:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7144.14s)]
*  Like, so like when it is like, so there's, there's selflessness, but there's [[01:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7146.38s)]
*  also a selfishness to it to an extent. [[01:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7149.9800000000005s)]
*  But I'm luckily beyond a part of a team that, Hey, like Debo is a superstar. [[01:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7152.5s)]
*  He's fantastic. [[01:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7156.18s)]
*  And he had a game where he had like 20, he had 20 receiving yards and 20 [[01:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7157.5s)]
*  rushing yards, we won by two touchdowns. [[01:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7161.58s)]
*  He's like, I don't care. [[01:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7163.62s)]
*  He's like, we're winning. [[01:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7164.860000000001s)]
*  I have another option, like we have another opportunity to play next week. [[01:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7166.34s)]
*  Like it is what it is. [[01:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7168.42s)]
*  And then he goes, and I'll be ready when I get my opportunity, I'll be ready for it. [[01:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7169.18s)]
*  And then you like, we had a playoff game. [[01:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7172.62s)]
*  He had a 74 yard touch here and he had like 120 yards receiving a [[01:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7174.02s)]
*  touchdown player of the game. [[01:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7177.06s)]
*  It's just like, we have those guys capable on our team, but we have six of [[01:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7178.700000000001s)]
*  those guys or seven of those guys are capable and then it's just, it's fun to [[01:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7182.18s)]
*  be a part of a team like that. [[01:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7185.34s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7186.38s)]
*  Cause it's not everywhere. [[01:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7186.9800000000005s)]
*  Was McCaffrey pretty excited when he got to go to your team? [[01:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7187.860000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I think he was. [[01:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7190.58s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7191.46s)]
*  I mean, just to have a change of pace. [[01:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7191.58s)]
*  I'm sure it's exciting for anyone. [[01:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7192.860000000001s)]
*  Also you're getting to go to a team that has a chance to move forward in the. [[01:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7194.42s)]
*  For sure. [[01:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7197.46s)]
*  And like he, I talking to Christian, like he loved Carolina. [[01:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7198.02s)]
*  He loved his experience. [[02:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7201.26s)]
*  He has a house here. [[02:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7202.02s)]
*  Like that's where he thought he was going to be for his whole career. [[02:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7202.62s)]
*  And they traded him and getting to come to San Francisco where, especially it was [[02:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7204.9400000000005s)]
*  fun to, cause I met Christian like, uh, 2018, 2019. [[02:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7209.78s)]
*  And so we've kind of been talking about like, Hey, it'd be really fun to [[02:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7213.299999999999s)]
*  like play together because we run the hell out of the football. [[02:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7215.379999999999s)]
*  He's really talented running back. [[02:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7218.419999999999s)]
*  Right. [[02:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7219.66s)]
*  And so we were always kind of joked about that. [[02:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7219.98s)]
*  He actually sent me a photo. [[02:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7221.94s)]
*  It was pretty funny. [[02:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7222.78s)]
*  We traded jerseys in 2019 and at the bottom of my jersey, I said, see you soon. [[02:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7223.339999999999s)]
*  And now he's a Niner, which is pretty sick. [[02:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7227.9s)]
*  Um, you got to speak things into existence, Theo. [[02:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7231.0599999999995s)]
*  It's really true, man. [[02:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7233.5s)]
*  I'll, we'll talk about that next. [[02:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7234.86s)]
*  We've got to come back to that. [[02:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7236.179999999999s)]
*  Cause I like that stuff. [[02:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7237.0199999999995s)]
*  Really? [[02:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7238.139999999999s)]
*  I'm big into that, but you gotta, um, so sorry, but like he came into [[02:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7238.66s)]
*  this offense that we run outside zone. [[02:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7242.82s)]
*  Like a lot of guys, like a lot of offices, you kind of see big guys waddle. [[02:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7244.74s)]
*  We're running as fast as we possibly can to try to make the, like, we're [[02:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7248.94s)]
*  trying to move the line of scrimmage that way while also moving it that way or that [[02:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7252.62s)]
*  way. [[02:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7256.299999999999s)]
*  So it's like, it's a lot more movement and it's, if you're a good running back [[02:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7256.42s)]
*  and you can see those lanes, it's a lot easier to run. [[02:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7259.38s)]
*  It's like, it's more difficult to run that way. [[02:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7262.5s)]
*  You have to have the opposite line and like Titans that are built for that. [[02:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7264.219999999999s)]
*  But when you have an O line Titan fullback, like combo that is talented [[02:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7267.0199999999995s)]
*  and Shanahan's very good at creating plays. [[02:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7271.0599999999995s)]
*  We're one of the best run offenses in football. [[02:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7272.94s)]
*  And so like for him to be a running back in that offense, it's a really good [[02:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7275.3s)]
*  opportunity. [[02:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7277.9s)]
*  It's exciting. [[02:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7278.62s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7279.34s)]
*  I felt excited when he got, cause even after your quarterback went out in the, [[02:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7279.62s)]
*  in the championship game, he had a great run right after that. [[02:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7283.7s)]
*  Right. [[02:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7287.42s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[02:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7287.78s)]
*  That touchdown. [[02:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7288.0199999999995s)]
*  That was insane. [[02:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7288.7s)]
*  I mean, that was Herculean dude. [[02:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7289.86s)]
*  And so that was like, so exciting. [[02:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7291.179999999999s)]
*  It was 18 wham. [[02:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7292.78s)]
*  It was 18 wham. [[02:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7294.0199999999995s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7294.82s)]
*  I down block on the defensive tackle, which happened to be Fletcher Cox. [[02:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7295.179999999999s)]
*  Big, he's a big dude. [[02:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7298.66s)]
*  Big deal. [[02:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7299.7s)]
*  He's a big dude. [[02:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7300.22s)]
*  He's large. [[02:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7301.26s)]
*  God. [[02:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7302.3s)]
*  And sometimes when you push in a large man, do you feel their stomach or where [[02:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7303.7s)]
*  do you put your hands on them? [[02:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7306.42s)]
*  Oh God. [[02:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7308.06s)]
*  Like the only way to move big people, you have to hit them and you have to hit [[02:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7308.740000000001s)]
*  people in the hip. [[02:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7311.26s)]
*  That's how you make a move. [[02:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7311.9400000000005s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7313.780000000001s)]
*  So like when I'm blocking, so like, do you know what you have any idea what [[02:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7313.900000000001s)]
*  gap scheme is? [[02:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7316.34s)]
*  You ever run power? [[02:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7318.54s)]
*  It's called power. [[02:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7319.3s)]
*  The Titan, everyone blocks down and you pull a guard from the opposite side to [[02:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7320.46s)]
*  kick somebody out. [[02:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7323.780000000001s)]
*  So it's called gap scheme. [[02:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7325.02s)]
*  It's called power. [[02:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7325.9400000000005s)]
*  Right. [[02:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7326.54s)]
*  Um, but on that, the entire coaching point is if there's real quick, if I'm [[02:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7327.34s)]
*  the right tight end and this is the offensive tackle, like this is the [[02:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7331.74s)]
*  offensive tackle right here and we're going that way. [[02:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7334.98s)]
*  And there's a guy standing right here. [[02:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7337.42s)]
*  I'm aiming my, my, my left shoulder pad is aimed on his hip. [[02:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7338.94s)]
*  Cause if I can hit that hip, his feet will move and then the right tackle will [[02:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7342.42s)]
*  pick them up and he'll move him for me while I go up to the linebacker dependent. [[02:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7345.94s)]
*  So you're creating a wall and the running back is going to go right behind us. [[02:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7349.34s)]
*  And so like my target is that hip and I'm trying to hit as violently and as [[02:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7352.74s)]
*  like hard as I possibly can. [[02:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7356.78s)]
*  Cause it doesn't matter if you're 200 pounds or if you're 300 pounds, if I get [[02:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7358.38s)]
*  you in that hip, it moves your base. [[02:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7361.98s)]
*  And then if you're off your base and getting hit by another big guy, you're [[02:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7363.82s)]
*  screwed, right? [[02:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7366.38s)]
*  And if it says that fast and it's that fast and like, they don't know that [[02:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7367.0199999999995s)]
*  play is coming too. [[02:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7369.5s)]
*  So like, that's where my advantage is. [[02:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7370.22s)]
*  And so I have to like, I'm like a coiled spring as soon as they say hi, and [[02:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7371.38s)]
*  I'm diving through that guy's hip to go up to the second level. [[02:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7375.14s)]
*  So yeah, sorry, gaps. [[02:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7377.86s)]
*  And that's my run game. [[02:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7378.78s)]
*  So I love the run game. [[02:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7379.46s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7380.7s)]
*  Cause we were talking about like, I don't get the ball every play and like, I [[02:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7380.86s)]
*  don't want the ball every play. [[02:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7384.26s)]
*  I like, I like getting the ball. [[02:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7385.38s)]
*  It's fun to catch the ball. [[02:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7386.5s)]
*  It's fun to run or like you like running with a football in open space and not [[02:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7387.34s)]
*  getting hit is one of the coolest things you can possibly do as a human being. [[02:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7391.62s)]
*  What did you feel like just driving real fast? [[02:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7394.42s)]
*  Dude, I have a smile on my face. [[02:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7396.14s)]
*  I'm just like, this is like, cause it doesn't happen very often. [[02:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7397.9800000000005s)]
*  It's hard to get that open in the NFL. [[02:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7400.18s)]
*  Cause everyone's such good athletes, but when you're just running through the [[02:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7401.66s)]
*  space, man, it is like it's illegal. [[02:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7404.22s)]
*  Yes. [[02:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7406.66s)]
*  Like I feel like I'm kidding. [[02:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7407.1s)]
*  You're just like, I just stole something. [[02:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7408.02s)]
*  I'm just running as fast as I can. [[02:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7409.42s)]
*  And it's, it's such a, it's such a thrilling feeling. [[02:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7411.5s)]
*  But so when I don't get to do that all the time, so like running routes is fun, [[02:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7414.0199999999995s)]
*  but when you don't get the ball running routes, isn't really fun. [[02:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7417.219999999999s)]
*  Cause I just get tired. [[02:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7418.82s)]
*  And so when you're in the run game and the whole thing is like, it depends on me, [[02:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7420.0199999999995s)]
*  like the running backs to help me has to set me up, but like, I have to hit this [[02:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7424.0199999999995s)]
*  guy as hard as I can, and then there's all these fundamentals, whether it's your [[02:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7427.66s)]
*  first step, your second step, your inside hand, where your outside hand goes. [[02:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7430.179999999999s)]
*  But like, there's just art to it. [[02:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7434.0599999999995s)]
*  And people that are really good at it, you see their technique and like what it [[02:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7435.66s)]
*  looks like, and it's just, it's really fun for me. [[02:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7439.0199999999995s)]
*  I watch a lot of, I like, I love watching offensive line, like run the football [[02:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7441.02s)]
*  and like hit people. [[02:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7444.780000000001s)]
*  So like, there's this artwork to it. [[02:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7445.860000000001s)]
*  So like I put, I like, I'm the best run blocking foot, run blocking Titan, the NFL. [[02:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7446.9400000000005s)]
*  I do it differently than anybody else does. [[02:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7452.5s)]
*  And I've been doing it differently for like my entire career. [[02:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7454.46s)]
*  And I like my first year, maybe not so much, but like second year on, I kind of [[02:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7456.620000000001s)]
*  like figured out what works for me. [[02:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7460.26s)]
*  And so I put as much effort as I can to that. [[02:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7462.06s)]
*  So then what's great about the tiny position, I can affect every single play. [[02:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7465.740000000001s)]
*  I can, I can have a huge impact on every single play in the football game. [[02:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7469.74s)]
*  Like a wide receiver was on the backside of an outside zone going away from him. [[02:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7473.14s)]
*  If he doesn't block the corner, it might not be a big deal. [[02:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7476.5s)]
*  Every play that I'm in on, I have, I have the opportunity to have a huge impact, [[02:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7479.860000000001s)]
*  whether it's run play or a pass play. [[02:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7483.58s)]
*  So like, I love playing tight end because I have that opportunity. [[02:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7484.82s)]
*  And because I get to do all those things, I'm going to do everything I can to be [[02:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7487.5s)]
*  great at all those things, whether it's pass blocking, run blocking, or running [[02:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7490.5s)]
*  routes and catching. [[02:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7493.54s)]
*  So like I'm the only position gets, you really get to do everything. [[02:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7494.22s)]
*  Like we had a tight end throw touchdown on a Superbowl a couple of years ago. [[02:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7497.14s)]
*  The Eagles guy. [[02:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7499.26s)]
*  Um, but like you got to do a little bit of everything. [[02:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7500.38s)]
*  And I really appreciate that. [[02:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7502.820000000001s)]
*  So like, I don't want to be an average run blocking tight end. [[02:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7503.860000000001s)]
*  Like I'm 240 pounds. [[02:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7507.34s)]
*  Like I'm not like there's tight ends out like Mercedes Lewis is six foot six, six, [[02:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7508.62s)]
*  seven, he's like two 65 that man. [[02:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7513.54s)]
*  He manhandles people and it's different. [[02:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7515.9400000000005s)]
*  Like we do two different, like we hit people differently, but like I'm trying, [[02:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7517.42s)]
*  like I want to be, and he is a very good tight end. [[02:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7521.06s)]
*  He's played for, he's going into year 18. [[02:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7522.780000000001s)]
*  He's fantastic. [[02:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7524.06s)]
*  I'm just like, I want to be great at everything that I'm asked to do. [[02:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7525.38s)]
*  So then I don't have to get taken out for anything. [[02:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7528.94s)]
*  I want to play every single step. [[02:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7530.74s)]
*  I do play every snap. [[02:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7532.42s)]

*  So yeah, like I don't get, I don't get hit anybody. [[02:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7553.7s)]
*  I have a huge blocking set at my house. [[02:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7556.54s)]
*  I'm going to hit. [[02:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7557.94s)]
*  I can't wait to hit that tomorrow. [[02:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7558.86s)]
*  It's going to be real fun. [[02:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7559.86s)]
*  And will you dress it up like certain players or anything? [[02:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7560.219999999999s)]
*  No, that's a good question though. [[02:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7562.82s)]
*  That's fun. [[02:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7564.179999999999s)]
*  I have thought about that, but no, I don't know who I would, I don't know who I'd set up. [[02:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7564.74s)]
*  I like, there's not, I don't really not like very many people in the NFL. [[02:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7568.62s)]
*  There's a couple of guys that, you know, I don't care about or I might not care for. [[02:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7571.5s)]
*  There's not too many games that I completely circle the calendar. [[02:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7577.54s)]
*  There's a couple just like based on the player that I get a go against, but I [[02:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7579.46s)]
*  don't have that issue very much. [[02:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7583.179999999999s)]
*  Which I like everybody. [[02:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7584.86s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7585.74s)]
*  Like what's one of those teams where you're like, I'm going against this team this week. [[02:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7585.9s)]
*  Um, the Rams, that's a big one for us. [[02:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7589.339999999999s)]
*  Like, because they play us, they play us the exact same way every time. [[02:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7593.0599999999995s)]
*  And then at the end of the day, they've Aaron Donald who's, I mean, yeah, besides [[02:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7597.219999999999s)]
*  Trent Williams, sorry, Trent Williams and Aaron Donald are the two best football [[02:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7601.5s)]
*  players in the NFL. [[02:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7605.0599999999995s)]
*  Not even close. [[02:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7606.139999999999s)]
*  Like, I mean, sorry, Patrick Mahomes is really good. [[02:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7606.82s)]
*  Like Aaron Rogers, Tom Brady, like there are other good players, but like for [[02:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7608.339999999999s)]
*  dominance of their position, every single snap, Trent Williams, Aaron Donald, and [[02:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7610.82s)]
*  Nick Bosa is getting there too. [[02:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7614.98s)]
*  He's going to be really good, but like Aaron Donald, like eight time all pro, [[02:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7615.94s)]
*  like that's insane. [[02:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7618.379999999999s)]
*  His whole career is he's all pro. [[02:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7619.66s)]
*  But so when you play the Rams, you have to game plan for Aaron Donald, because [[02:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7621.179999999999s)]
*  if you only put one guy on him, the likelihood of him blowing up the play and [[02:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7623.9s)]
*  hitting the running back or the quarterback in the backfield and making them fumble [[02:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7627.299999999999s)]
*  significantly increases. [[02:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7629.86s)]
*  So you have to, so you have to completely game plan for him. [[02:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7631.0599999999995s)]
*  So you got to plan for him hugely. [[02:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7633.7s)]
*  Yeah, hugely. [[02:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7635.099999999999s)]
*  And, um, so we had to plan for him like huge and then, um, sorry. [[02:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7636.099999999999s)]
*  So like, and then like the way they play their defense is they just try to [[02:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7642.34s)]
*  bottleneck us as much as they can. [[02:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7645.22s)]
*  So it makes our outside zone a little bit more difficult. [[02:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7646.78s)]
*  Um, and then they kind of played in this, like kind of a quarters thing where like [[02:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7649.14s)]
*  they keep everything in front of like, it's kind of been, but don't break. [[02:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7652.78s)]
*  Like you can give up some small stuff, but you're not getting anything past us. [[02:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7655.18s)]
*  And then they're going to be very violent and they're going to come up in the run [[02:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7657.5s)]
*  game. [[02:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7659.46s)]
*  Um, and so it's just like playing a team like that where they're so like, I'm in [[02:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7660.22s)]
*  my three point stance deal and line of scrimmage is like right here. [[02:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7664.9800000000005s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[02:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7669.02s)]
*  They have an outside linebacker who's wider than you are and like a tilted [[02:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7670.1s)]
*  stance and a sprinter stance. [[02:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7673.5s)]
*  And the second we say hike, he's trying to run through my face as fast as he can [[02:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7674.9s)]
*  that way to not let me reach him. [[02:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7678.0199999999995s)]
*  And they're like, not every team does that, but it's very difficult to go against [[02:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7680.66s)]
*  because at that point it's just kind of me saying, all right, who's going to hit [[02:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7683.62s)]
*  who harder every time, every time. [[02:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7686.74s)]
*  And like we've like, and like, there's different ways that we, we sometimes put [[02:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7690.1s)]
*  a guy in motion and we're like, we'll double team that guy because like having [[02:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7693.26s)]
*  to hit somebody and anchor, I think is easier than having to hit somebody and [[02:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7696.54s)]
*  then move. [[02:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7699.98s)]
*  Cause if I anchor the window doesn't, everyone, he runs into my back, feel me? [[02:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7700.46s)]
*  Like, so if like, if I go to block you and the office alliance coming this way and [[02:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7705.5s)]
*  I stopped my feet, I'm gonna get ran up on it. [[02:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7708.78s)]
*  Someone's going to go through my legs. [[02:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7710.86s)]
*  So like I have to hit you and then keep my feet running. [[02:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7711.74s)]
*  So I'm running, like the people behind me are also moving people towards me. [[02:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7714.3s)]
*  Like if you're at the point of attack, you have to run and his job is to not [[02:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7718.0199999999995s)]
*  let me run. [[02:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7720.98s)]
*  It's wild. [[02:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7722.14s)]
*  So, but the Rams are really good job of that. [[02:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7722.7s)]
*  If you do you think, say, if you coach, you coached me, you train me, right? [[02:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7725.1s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7730.22s)]
*  Ultimate training, ultimate coaching. [[02:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7731.02s)]
*  Do you think I could play? [[02:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7733.22s)]
*  You don't know in the NFL or like pickleball pickleball. [[02:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7735.02s)]
*  I think you'd be really good at pickleball. [[02:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7739.26s)]
*  Come on, man. [[02:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7741.02s)]
*  We have a lot of guys that play it. [[02:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7741.740000000001s)]
*  I love that game. [[02:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7742.660000000001s)]
*  What about in maybe the USFL? [[02:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7743.26s)]
*  Like what position you want, dog? [[02:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7746.14s)]
*  Huh? [[02:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7747.18s)]
*  Well, I'm saying anything on the field and you were my trainer, man. [[02:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7747.5s)]
*  And I don't get, and I would never give up. [[02:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7751.46s)]
*  You could long snap. [[02:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7753.42s)]
*  I have a good long snap. [[02:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7755.46s)]
*  But I mean, you'd have to, how much do you weigh right now? [[02:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7756.42s)]
*  Probably 186, 184. [[02:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7758.860000000001s)]
*  You'd have to get like 220. [[02:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7760.820000000001s)]
*  Fuck dude. [[02:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7762.5s)]
*  Well, you have to, you have to, you have to hold some weight because like in the [[02:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7763.620000000001s)]
*  NFL, when there's a small long snapper, they'll just put like a defensive lineman [[02:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7766.14s)]
*  on them and it just crushes them. [[02:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7769.18s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[02:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7771.26s)]
*  So like there's a, you have to have a little size to you at least, but you [[02:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7771.9400000000005s)]
*  could do that. [[02:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7775.58s)]
*  I just want to have to wake up and eat at night, like in the middle of the night, [[02:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7775.900000000001s)]
*  like a baby. [[02:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7778.9400000000005s)]
*  Dude. [[02:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7779.860000000001s)]
*  So in college, I had a really difficult time, like I couldn't get past 225. [[02:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7780.1s)]
*  I couldn't do it for like three years. [[02:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7784.18s)]
*  And so in my third year, I drank eight Gatorade protein shakes a day. [[02:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7785.9800000000005s)]
*  And like literally I had, so let's just say I wake up at 6 AM for my lift. [[02:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7790.9800000000005s)]
*  I drink a protein shake. [[02:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7796.5s)]
*  Then I get to my lift and before I get, before I start the lift, before I start [[02:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7797.38s)]
*  the warm up, I drink another protein shake. [[02:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7802.58s)]
*  I go through the warmup, come in, drink a protein shake before I get on the [[02:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7803.860000000001s)]
*  scale, this is just to try to keep my weight on. [[02:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7807.46s)]
*  Uh, after the lift, I drink a protein shake. [[02:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7810.0599999999995s)]
*  I take three or I think I'm at four. [[02:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7812.34s)]
*  I think I'm at four there. [[02:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7814.62s)]
*  I leave and then for lunch, I have a protein shake. [[02:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7815.82s)]
*  I'm in class. [[02:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7818.54s)]
*  I have a protein shake. [[02:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7819.18s)]
*  Is your truck just full of dirty protein shake containers? [[02:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7820.46s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7822.66s)]
*  Like do you ever see the old Gatorade cans? [[02:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7822.74s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7824.78s)]
*  Like those big thick ones. [[02:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7825.34s)]
*  They do. [[02:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7826.82s)]
*  No, I'm lying to you. [[02:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7827.1s)]
*  Hold on. [[02:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7827.86s)]
*  Bring it up. [[02:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7828.1s)]
*  Hold that up. [[02:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7828.5s)]
*  Look up Gatorade protein shake can, aluminum, like metal can, but I would drink [[02:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7828.9s)]
*  those, I had so many of them at my house. [[02:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7833.22s)]
*  And then I'd have one with dent, like before I go to bed and I would set an alarm. [[02:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7835.34s)]
*  Uh, if I was really struggling, if I would set an alarm for 3 a.m. [[02:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7839.0599999999995s)]
*  or no 2 a.m. [[02:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7841.78s)]

*  To have them again. [[02:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7843.0599999999995s)]

*  That's because that was the easiest thing for me. [[02:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7844.82s)]
*  I didn't eat like, oh yeah, that thing. [[02:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7846.179999999999s)]
*  Do you could kill someone with that? [[02:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7848.5s)]
*  Like it was, it was a brick. [[02:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7849.62s)]
*  I don't even see that. [[02:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7851.139999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7852.299999999999s)]
*  I don't think that's available to the, just to the public. [[02:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7852.46s)]
*  It's not available anymore. [[02:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7854.38s)]
*  But also like I literally was insane. [[02:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7855.5s)]

*  Well, yeah, that's actually weird. [[02:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7865.0199999999995s)]
*  I didn't even know Gatorade did protein until I got to Iowa and I was like, oh, [[02:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7866.18s)]
*  whoa, no one knew it until just now. [[02:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7868.860000000001s)]
*  Probably every college football athlete knew that was in a lot of places. [[02:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7872.18s)]
*  But yeah, so that was, uh, so you got to have that weight on. [[02:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7874.900000000001s)]
*  So that's a number one thing to even be able to play. [[02:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7877.22s)]
*  You really have to have some weight on you. [[02:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7879.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7880.780000000001s)]
*  To an extent. [[02:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7880.9800000000005s)]
*  Like, I mean, like I was, like I said, I was, if I weighed 225 pounds right now, [[02:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7881.5s)]
*  I wouldn't be in the NFL. [[02:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7885.14s)]

*  Like I have to be at least 240 for me to like be able to move people still. [[02:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7887.820000000001s)]
*  To even show up. [[02:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7891.34s)]

*  couple of times or, um, but yeah, he's like a gentlest giant. [[02:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7911.139999999999s)]

*  He's a cool guy. [[02:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7918.0599999999995s)]
*  I haven't met a ton of NFL players, but I got to see Brandon Marshall at the [[02:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7918.94s)]
*  Super Bowl, real nice guy. [[02:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7922.94s)]
*  He's cool too. [[02:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7924.38s)]
*  He's huge. [[02:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7925.219999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7926.179999999999s)]
*  He was very tall. [[02:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7926.46s)]
*  I thought it was thick too. [[02:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7927.5s)]
*  White Howard at first. [[02:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7928.86s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7930.099999999999s)]
*  That's funny. [[02:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7930.78s)]
*  But yeah, that is, he's bigger than I am too. [[02:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7931.5s)]
*  And he played wide receiver. [[02:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7933.7s)]
*  Think about that for a sec. [[02:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7934.86s)]
*  It's like Brandon, why don't you just play tight end dude? [[02:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7936.42s)]
*  Well, less money, but I was like, I mean, you could have already played [[02:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7937.9s)]
*  another couple of years. [[02:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7941.0599999999995s)]
*  Why do y'all get less money? [[02:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7941.9s)]
*  I don't know. [[02:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7943.94s)]
*  Let's figure that out. [[02:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7945.5s)]
*  You, I'll call in and you're going to figure it out. [[02:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7946.299999999999s)]
*  Cause you're doing more. [[02:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7948.0599999999995s)]
*  Thank you. [[02:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7949.259999999999s)]
*  I never realized that. [[02:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7950.62s)]
*  Get, get this. [[02:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7951.82s)]
*  So, um, Travis Kelsey, this guy, 1300 yards, 10, 10 touchdowns a year for [[02:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7952.7s)]
*  like the last seven years, basically. [[02:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7957.82s)]
*  But it gets more ball thrown home than you. [[02:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7959.54s)]
*  Sure. [[02:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7961.139999999999s)]
*  But my point is, is that if he was a wide receiver, his contract, he'd be the [[02:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7961.46s)]
*  26th highest paid wide receiver in the NFL. [[02:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7966.82s)]
*  Does that make sense? [[02:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7969.22s)]
*  No, no, he should probably be top five. [[02:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7970.0199999999995s)]
*  So that's like, I don't know. [[02:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7972.78s)]
*  He should probably be making if like there's wide receivers out there [[02:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7974.38s)]
*  making over $25 million that don't get his stats. [[02:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7976.82s)]
*  Like why would he not get paid more? [[02:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7980.62s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7982.46s)]
*  Right. [[02:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7983.14s)]
*  I mean, like I was, I think I was 30 in the NFL and touchdowns this year. [[02:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7983.5s)]
*  And yeah, I mean, there's 20 receivers that make more money than me. [[02:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7986.9s)]
*  That's unfair. [[02:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7991.3s)]
*  No, yeah. [[02:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7992.34s)]
*  And like, I'm happy for them. [[02:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7992.78s)]
*  I'm happy for them that they're making their money. [[02:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7993.86s)]
*  No, it's nothing against them. [[02:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7995.9800000000005s)]
*  It's just like, that's the Titan market. [[02:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7996.82s)]
*  Like our franchise tag is like $10 million, which is like, if a team doesn't [[02:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=7998.1s)]
*  like, um, Evan Ingram, Titan for the Jackson, he was franchise tag, which [[02:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=8002.14s)]
*  means like, they don't want to do a new deal yet, but they're going to give you [[02:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=8006.58s)]
*  a one year deal and it's based on the average of like the top couple contracts [[02:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=8008.78s)]
*  of your position. [[02:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=8012.98s)]
*  So like his was $10 million and then the quarterback franchise tag is $30 million. [[02:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=8013.9s)]
*  For that one season. [[02:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=8017.98s)]
*  And I get the quarterback is the most, that's the most important position, but [[02:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=8019.62s)]
*  like wide receiver franchise tag is, I want to say like 20 something. [[02:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=8022.42s)]
*  What's like, are they really double the value? [[02:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=8025.86s)]
*  No, I don't think so. [[02:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=8027.7s)]
*  Especially. [[02:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=8029.099999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=8029.74s)]
*  I don't think. [[02:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=8030.34s)]
*  No, I don't. [[02:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=8031.46s)]
*  Especially now when you get into all these hybrid, you have like taste them Hill. [[02:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=8031.82s)]
*  You have a hybrid player that could possibly do it all. [[02:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=8034.62s)]
*  Yeah, sure. [[02:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=8036.34s)]
*  Like, and like, no, not the thing when you get in, you, you have to be great at [[02:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=8036.9s)]
*  all those things for it to be a value of you in a contract negotiation too. [[02:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=8042.5s)]
*  Right. [[02:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=8046.139999999999s)]
*  That's a good point. [[02:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=8046.379999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=8046.9s)]
*  So you have to be great. [[02:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=8047.139999999999s)]
*  Like if you, and if you can just, if you can just do several things, but you do [[02:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=8047.82s)]
*  them average Lee, I'd rather have like a guy that does this grade and a guy that [[02:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=8052.58s)]
*  does this grade than having a guy that doesn't both average. [[02:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=8057.0599999999995s)]
*  Right. [[02:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=8059.0599999999995s)]
*  That's a good point. [[02:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=8059.54s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=8060.259999999999s)]
*  So like, that's a part of it too, but it's just like, is there, is there a position [[02:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=8060.42s)]
*  that we don't know that you could possibly play on the field that people [[02:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=8063.86s)]
*  wouldn't really realize maybe? [[02:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=8066.34s)]
*  Dude, I would love to play like outside linebacker in a three, four defense. [[02:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=8067.74s)]
*  Kind of like, I know I'm not going to say like, I'm not going to say off. [[02:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=8072.3s)]
*  I'm going to be amazing at it, but I think I would have a real shot at it. [[02:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=8075.5s)]
*  If I could get up to like two 60, two 65, maybe two 70 and set an edge. [[02:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=8078.22s)]
*  I think I'd do that. [[02:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=8083.02s)]
*  I'm a really good athlete and like, you don't have to run as much. [[02:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=8083.74s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=8086.7s)]
*  Which is really nice. [[02:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=8086.860000000001s)]
*  I get tired sometimes, dude. [[02:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=8087.58s)]
*  Oh, I get tired watching. [[02:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=8089.18s)]

*  I never knocked wood on an American flag. [[02:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=8441.94s)]
*  That's gotta be good luck. [[02:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=8443.34s)]
*  That's gotta be good luck. [[02:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=8444.38s)]

*  Yeah. [[02:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=8446.54s)]
*  But so that's how hard was it when like did, um, our fourth [[02:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=8446.7s)]
*  quarterback was Josh, by the way. [[02:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=8451.3s)]
*  Great. [[02:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=8452.9s)]
*  Josh, Josh Johnson. [[02:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=8453.46s)]
*  That was the last guy who got hurt. [[02:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=8454.62s)]
*  That was the last guy that got hurt. [[02:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=8455.9s)]
*  And then, so after that, who was there, was there any talk or that [[02:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=8457.14s)]
*  somebody else could go in there? [[02:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=8460.62s)]
*  So like you, like you, you tentatively game plan for like an [[02:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=8462.22s)]
*  emergency quarterback and Kyle, you check our fullback was our [[02:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=8465.9s)]
*  emergency quarterback, but like, there's only like, he doesn't [[02:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=8468.3s)]
*  know all the footwork stuff for plays. [[02:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=8474.06s)]
*  Like the playbook was like four play like four to eight plays. [[02:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=8475.22s)]
*  Cause it's crazy. [[02:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=8477.66s)]
*  Cause Shannon coach Shanahan, Kyle Shanahan, he's been NFL, [[02:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=8479.58s)]
*  like, I want to say like 15 to 20 years, like being a part of [[02:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=8482.539999999999s)]
*  coaching in it. [[02:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=8485.26s)]
*  And he's never had it happen to him. [[02:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=8486.22s)]
*  His dad, Mike Shanahan never, never seen it in his career. [[02:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=8487.859999999999s)]
*  He can't even text his dad at halftime. [[02:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=8491.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=8492.42s)]
*  What do I do? [[02:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=8492.82s)]
*  Like he never experienced it either. [[02:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=8493.539999999999s)]
*  And then we have our running backs coach. [[02:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=8495.18s)]
*  And he's like, he's in year like 60 and he's never seen it either. [[02:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=8496.5s)]
*  And like at any level. [[02:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=8499.66s)]
*  And so it's just like, it doesn't happen often. [[02:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=8500.62s)]
*  So like you're mildly and everyone's like, well, why aren't you more [[02:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=8503.1s)]
*  prepared? Cause it doesn't happen. [[02:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=8505.26s)]
*  Like, you don't say you're not prepared, but were you guys like looking around [[02:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=8506.74s)]
*  the sideline, like who's even lean enough here to even throw it? [[02:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=8509.58s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[02:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=8512.380000000001s)]
*  Like, cause at that point it's also like a stat. [[02:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=8512.82s)]
*  You can't have like, the only thing that I wanted to see just for like, even [[02:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=8514.66s)]
*  at the point, like, cause like after, after Josh got hurt, like, and we were [[02:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=8518.18s)]
*  down and like, it's, I think at that, when he, Josh got hurt, where I think [[02:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=8522.5s)]
*  we're only down set, like we might've been down seven or no, we were down [[02:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=8525.619999999999s)]
*  21 to seven, excuse me, when he got hurt. [[02:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=8528.5s)]
*  And so at that point, you're like, okay, we can't throw. [[02:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=8531.699999999999s)]
*  We like the next couple of minutes, like you're like, okay, we might have a shot [[02:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=8534.859999999999s)]
*  here, but I think they went down and scored it's 28 to seven. [[02:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=8537.619999999999s)]
*  And you're just like, we can't physically throw the football and they're just [[02:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=8540.38s)]
*  going to put 11 people in the box. [[02:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=8543.5s)]
*  All right. [[02:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=8545.58s)]
*  Like sure. [[02:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=8545.939999999999s)]
*  Like how creative can you get? [[02:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=8546.699999999999s)]
*  I know, uh, Joanne Jennings, one of our wide receivers, he played at Tennessee. [[02:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=8548.5s)]
*  He was like a top five quarterback recruit in high school, which was kind of, [[02:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=8551.9s)]
*  so like, maybe I wanted to see that, but like at the end of the day, like, [[02:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=8554.9s)]
*  you're not going to, it's not high school where you just put your best athlete at [[02:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=8558.34s)]
*  quarterback or college where you can just put a really fast guy at quarterback. [[02:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=8560.78s)]
*  Can you just run around the edge and do cool stuff? [[02:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=8563.06s)]
*  Like that doesn't exist in the NFL. [[02:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=8564.78s)]
*  Like it just doesn't happen. [[02:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=8567.5s)]
*  Like there's too many good athletes. [[02:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=8568.38s)]
*  So it's like, but like, Hey, if you would've gotten in and like, we were to [[02:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=8569.3s)]
*  throw on the ball, he throws interception. [[02:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=8572.699999999999s)]
*  It is what it is. [[02:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=8573.94s)]
*  Like we're like, you try and ever you can to not like, oh, we're going to lose [[02:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=8574.66s)]
*  this game, but it's like we, the most important position we don't have. [[02:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=8578.26s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=8581.859999999999s)]
*  Fuck. [[02:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=8582.46s)]
*  I was so it's like playing chess. [[02:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=8582.779999999999s)]
*  You don't have a king. [[02:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=8584.06s)]
*  Oh, you lost. [[02:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=8585.38s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=8586.5s)]
*  Like, I mean, the only other team I've seen do is the Denver Broncos during [[02:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=8586.66s)]
*  COVID, they had all their quarterbacks had COVID and so he put a wide receiver [[02:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=8589.179999999998s)]
*  in, but they had a week to prepare at least, or a couple of days at least. [[02:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=8592.38s)]
*  But it's just like, what are you supposed to do? [[02:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=8595.179999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=8597.34s)]

*  It was such a bummer, man. [[02:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=8598.3s)]
*  I'm so sorry. [[02:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=8599.179999999998s)]
*  It wasn't any fun to watch. [[02:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=8600.019999999999s)]
*  No. [[02:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=8601.06s)]
*  And like, Hey, if you're an Eagles football player and Eagles fan, probably loved it. [[02:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=8602.099999999999s)]
*  And good, like you should, like, [[02:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=8606.42s)]

*  Then you're sick too. [[02:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=8610.62s)]
*  Sure. [[02:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=8612.06s)]
*  I'll hate that dude. [[02:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=8612.38s)]
*  Well, like they brought, they loved winning, but like winning in that way is [[02:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=8613.74s)]
*  like, it's not exciting. [[02:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=8616.539999999999s)]
*  Right. [[02:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=8617.7s)]
*  If there's nothing, like there's not really any exciting about that. [[02:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=8618.62s)]
*  No. [[02:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=8621.02s)]
*  And it's you're cheering then or. [[02:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=8621.78s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=8623.58s)]
*  It's like, sure. [[02:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=8623.74s)]
*  Like, Hey, you guys are score. [[02:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=8624.66s)]
*  Like they're winning the game and they're beating it. [[02:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=8625.46s)]
*  Like, yeah, there's not much you're beating somebody who is like hands [[02:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=8626.98s)]
*  are tied behind their back and like, Hey, they won and they, [[02:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=8630.3s)]
*  you're not saying no, but I feel you. [[02:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=8633.9s)]
*  Like at least it would have been an entertaining game. [[02:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=8635.58s)]
*  If like, even if like, well, they should take their quarterback out. [[02:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=8637.98s)]
*  Both of them that'd be wild. [[02:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=8641.1s)]
*  If they go, well, how about this? [[02:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=8642.9s)]
*  That's insane. [[02:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=8644.46s)]
*  I shouldn't even say that. [[02:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=8645.14s)]
*  Do you think it's fair that the, that the overtime team just goes to [[02:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=8646.22s)]
*  kick that field goal? [[02:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=8649.42s)]
*  It seems kind of lame each time. [[02:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=8650.42s)]
*  Like for the win, that rule changed like five years ago. [[02:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=8652.86s)]
*  Oh, it did. [[02:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=8655.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=8655.9s)]
*  So that good. [[02:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=8656.1s)]
*  So then it went to like, you got to, if you score a touchdown, you automatically [[02:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=8656.98s)]
*  win and then this past season in the playoffs and overtime, both teams get a [[02:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=8659.9s)]
*  chance. [[02:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=8665.060000000001s)]
*  Whether it's a touchdown or not, because I remember the bills chiefs game from [[02:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=8666.42s)]
*  last year and went back and forth and everyone's like, well, if the bill, like [[02:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=8669.02s)]
*  the offenses were so high powered, if the, if the bills would have gotten a shot, [[02:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=8672.220000000001s)]
*  they would have gone out and scored. [[02:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=8674.98s)]
*  And so they changed the rule for the playoffs. [[02:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=8675.86s)]
*  If that happened, that both teams get an opportunity to add it, which was [[02:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=8677.54s)]
*  interesting to see. [[02:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=8680.74s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=8681.7s)]
*  I think it's more exciting. [[02:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=8682.140000000001s)]
*  It can make the game a little bit longer. [[02:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=8683.18s)]
*  It definitely makes it more exciting as a fan. [[02:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=8684.34s)]
*  I think, I mean, I think college has overtime. [[02:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=8685.78s)]
*  Perfect. [[02:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=8688.54s)]
*  Like just so much fun. [[02:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=8689.220000000001s)]
*  It's so much like 11th overtime. [[02:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=8690.380000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=8692.060000000001s)]
*  Do you like that? [[02:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=8692.18s)]
*  And then also like for the people watching, like those touchdowns count. [[02:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=8693.46s)]
*  And like, there's multiple of those. [[02:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=8697.58s)]
*  So I was just like, a guy could go and like, what was like the, there's like an [[02:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=8698.66s)]
*  LSU Ole Miss game that it was like tied like 17 to 17 and it ended 53 to 48 or [[02:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=8701.18s)]
*  something like that, or 53 to 47, something like that. [[02:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=8705.74s)]
*  But it's like a guy in that game, a wide receiver, like at the end of the game, [[02:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=8709.3s)]
*  he had like five catches for 60 yards and a touchdown at the end of the game. [[02:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=8712.18s)]
*  He had, uh, eight catches for four touchdowns and a hundred yards. [[02:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=8715.1s)]
*  It's just like, what, where this come from? [[02:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=8719.86s)]
*  It's a four over time. [[02:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=8721.22s)]
*  So I think the NFL should just start at the 35 yard line because then if you go [[02:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=8721.78s)]
*  three and now it's still a 52 yard kick, like that's not easy, right? [[02:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=8725.7s)]
*  52 yards from the 35 and just have them do it that way. [[02:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=8728.900000000001s)]
*  It'd be so much fun. [[02:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=8731.900000000001s)]
*  I mean, just like, you're just taking shots for touchdowns at that point, man. [[02:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=8733.460000000001s)]
*  Like it'd be sick. [[02:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=8735.820000000002s)]
*  Dude. [[02:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=8737.42s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=8737.74s)]
*  That'd be a blast. [[02:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=8737.980000000001s)]
*  Like, dude, the stats too, like fantasy football players, fantasy football guys [[02:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=8738.74s)]
*  would love that because, Hey, now Devante at the end of overtime where he has 10 [[02:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=8742.380000000001s)]
*  catches for 120 at two touchdowns. [[02:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=8746.26s)]
*  Now he has 14 catches for six touchdowns. [[02:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=8748.02s)]
*  They'd never, yeah. [[02:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=8751.18s)]
*  Fantasy football guys would be crazy. [[02:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=8751.78s)]
*  They'd never even talk to their wives anymore. [[02:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=8753.300000000001s)]
*  Do you think, uh, and we'll get you out of here in a second. [[02:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=8756.7s)]
*  Um, what was you were talking about? [[02:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=8760.820000000002s)]
*  Like, um, uh, Oh, do you think that, um, who do you think will be [[02:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=8762.62s)]
*  else quarterback next year? [[02:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=8768.900000000001s)]
*  Um, Brock will get a fair shot at it. [[02:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=8770.78s)]
*  Do you think? [[02:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=8772.740000000002s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[02:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=8773.42s)]
*  I mean, he didn't, he hasn't lost a game yet. [[02:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=8773.740000000002s)]
*  Like he got hurt at his first, like the fifth play of the game. [[02:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=8775.58s)]
*  And so like, he hasn't really lost a game yet. [[02:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=8778.300000000001s)]
*  He should get it. [[02:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=8780.220000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=8780.98s)]
*  I mean, so it's also a very competitive room over there. [[02:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=8781.140000000001s)]
*  It's a super competitive room. [[02:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=8783.140000000001s)]
*  Well, right now we don't Trey Lance. [[02:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=8784.1s)]
*  I think he, he just got cleared. [[02:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=8786.060000000001s)]
*  It's like, he's out throwing and stuff again. [[02:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=8787.300000000001s)]
*  So that's awesome. [[02:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=8788.74s)]
*  I'm very happy for him. [[02:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=8789.380000000001s)]
*  Like, cause he's a very, he's a very special talent who has the ability [[02:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=8790.220000000001s)]
*  to be a very good football player. [[02:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=8794.42s)]
*  He just needs reps and that guy, he just, he's young. [[02:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=8795.7s)]
*  He hasn't played a lot of football. [[02:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=8797.94s)]
*  And he sees reps. [[02:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=8798.74s)]
*  So it'll be a good battle between them. [[02:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=8799.94s)]
*  Um, and Garoppolo, y'all still have him? [[02:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=8801.78s)]
*  No, he's a free agent. [[02:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=8803.62s)]
*  Oh, he's going to leave. [[02:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=8804.74s)]
*  Probably. [[02:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=8805.460000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=8805.78s)]
*  He's out. [[02:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=8806.02s)]
*  Oh dang. [[02:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=8806.62s)]
*  I think it's a, um, if Brady came back, would he be able to go to y'all or not? [[02:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=8810.02s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=8813.86s)]
*  He's a free agent. [[02:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=8814.060000000001s)]
*  That'd be wild. [[02:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=8815.54s)]
*  That'd be wild. [[02:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=8817.9s)]
*  Huh? [[02:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=8818.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=8819.060000000001s)]
*  I mean, he's from the Bay. [[02:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=8819.18s)]
*  He is. [[02:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=8820.460000000001s)]
*  He is from the Bay. [[02:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=8821.060000000001s)]
*  That's crazy. [[02:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=8822.1s)]
*  Interesting. [[02:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=8825.26s)]
*  Anyways, but, um, Purdy, I, like I said, like pretty one, a games. [[02:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=8827.74s)]
*  You can't like bench, you can't, you can't bench him. [[02:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=8832.54s)]
*  So I think it's a, it's a, it's a quarterback competition. [[02:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=8835.02s)]
*  I think when you go to, and again, [[02:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=8838.140000000001s)]
*  but I can't win eight games doing just even betting money line every week. [[02:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=8839.74s)]
*  It's crazy. [[02:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=8842.54s)]
*  But like, and I, and again, like he's hurt right now. [[02:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=8843.300000000001s)]
*  Right. [[02:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=8845.220000000001s)]
*  So I think he does, I think he had surgery today maybe on his UCL, which is [[02:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=8845.34s)]
*  like the ACL of your elbow, I guess. [[02:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=8848.78s)]
*  Oh, they got a third one now. [[02:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=8850.300000000001s)]

*  So like, it's going to be, it's going to be an interesting training camp to see [[02:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=8855.220000000001s)]
*  how the reps are split and stuff like that. [[02:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=8858.78s)]
*  It's going to be exciting. [[02:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=8860.42s)]
*  It will be exciting. [[02:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=8861.18s)]
*  And that's my entire, my entire career, I've had QB controversy. [[02:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=8862.220000000001s)]
*  So let's ride dude, another year of a baby. [[02:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=8865.54s)]
*  I love it. [[02:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=8867.82s)]
*  That's exciting. [[02:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=8868.34s)]
*  Bring it. [[02:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=8868.98s)]
*  You, you, you, one last thing for you. [[02:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=8869.779999999999s)]
*  If I want to get you were talking about like speaking things in a [[02:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=8871.22s)]
*  existence. [[02:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=8873.98s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=8874.46s)]
*  You wanted to bring it back that up. [[02:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=8874.619999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=8876.42s)]
*  Cause you kind of talked about it. [[02:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=8876.619999999999s)]
*  It's interesting how little we like speak out into the world what we want. [[02:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=8877.539999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=8881.06s)]
*  Like how, like how often do like I'll sit and complain in my head or think about [[02:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=8881.699999999999s)]
*  things or worry bro all for years. [[02:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=8885.779999999999s)]
*  But rarely will I say this is what I fucking want. [[02:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=8888.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=8892.06s)]
*  You know, and say you're going to do it. [[02:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=8892.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=8893.94s)]
*  So you're going to get it. [[02:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=8894.34s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=8895.1s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=8895.5s)]
*  Like I'm big, like, I don't know if you journal very much, but I got big into [[02:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=8895.66s)]
*  that this literally like the last 12 months, uh, met a former player who, uh, [[02:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=8898.7s)]
*  who kind of talked about how he did it too. [[02:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=8902.9s)]
*  And like just writing down, like what you expect the season to be, like what [[02:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=8904.82s)]
*  your, what your goals are or writing about them in the past tense too. [[02:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=8909.14s)]
*  That was kind of a cool thing to take me, give me an example of that. [[02:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=8912.98s)]
*  So like, you could talk about winning the super bowl or you could talk about [[02:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=8916.02s)]
*  like, I won the super bowl. [[02:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=8920.02s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=8921.34s)]
*  And then you talk about confetti fall and you talk about like, and you speak [[02:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=8921.460000000001s)]
*  it into existence, like there's a creativeness to it. [[02:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=8924.46s)]
*  And so like, it's kind of why, cause then once you see it and you've, it's [[02:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=8927.06s)]
*  kind of like the same as football. [[02:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=8929.859999999999s)]
*  Like I do a visualization a lot. [[02:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=8930.74s)]
*  So like I rep the plays in my head. [[02:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=8932.46s)]
*  And so then by the time I get to them and practice, or whether it's the game, [[02:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=8934.5s)]
*  I've already done them in my head, like 10 times. [[02:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=8937.259999999998s)]
*  So when you call the play and I've nothing to worry about, cause I've already done [[02:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=8939.3s)]
*  it and so it's like speaking into existence too, it's like you visualize it [[02:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=8941.46s)]
*  happening and then so like, I don't know if you speak it into existence or like [[02:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=8945.46s)]
*  once the moment comes, you're ready for it. [[02:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=8949.14s)]
*  What's really interesting, man. [[02:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=8950.74s)]
*  It makes me think of EMDR. [[02:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=8951.9s)]
*  You know, have you heard of this? [[02:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=8953.78s)]
*  Maybe, I don't know. [[02:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=8954.900000000001s)]
*  Explain it to me. [[02:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=8955.62s)]
*  Can you bring it up? [[02:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=8956.300000000001s)]
*  I think my wife is Coleman. [[02:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=8960.26s)]
*  So EMDR eye movement, decent, desensitization and reprocessing [[02:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=8962.34s)]
*  therapy is a mental health treatment technique. [[02:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=8968.66s)]
*  The method involves moving your eyes. [[02:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=8970.5s)]
*  Goal is to help you heal from trauma or other distress. [[02:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=8972.820000000002s)]
*  So anyway, what's interesting about EMDR is it, they take you back to times in [[02:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=8975.58s)]
*  your life, right? [[02:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=8979.060000000001s)]
*  That were traumatic for you and they, you, you, you talk through with a therapist [[02:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=8980.140000000001s)]
*  to, to put a new experience into that time of your life. [[02:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=8988.380000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=8993.300000000001s)]
*  So then when you come out of the, the, the like a modality or the, the [[02:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=8993.86s)]
*  experience of doing EMDR, the therapy, then the past part of your life that was [[02:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=9000.1s)]
*  hurting you, it's now filled with a different part of your life that's positive. [[02:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=9006.62s)]
*  So where you are at now currently will eventually start to feel different [[02:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=9010.62s)]
*  because of the past, the popples have been filled in. [[02:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=9014.14s)]
*  So it's almost like a reverse of doing that, which you're saying. [[02:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=9016.82s)]
*  Yeah, sure. [[02:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=9020.78s)]
*  Like you're creating those in the future. [[02:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=9021.26s)]
*  And so then by the time you get to them, it's like, well, you're looking back on [[02:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=9023.94s)]
*  your past, you're writing into your own past that hasn't even happened yet. [[02:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=9026.74s)]
*  You're writing your own past and saying these things happen. [[02:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=9030.74s)]
*  It's wild. [[02:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=9033.42s)]
*  And like, yeah, like, and I, I did it every single day for the entire season. [[02:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=9033.980000000001s)]
*  Wow. [[02:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=9037.7s)]
*  It's wild. [[02:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=9038.34s)]
*  And whether you're writing, like whether your goals are personally for the season, [[02:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=9038.66s)]
*  whether it's goals, like whatever it is, but like kind of talking about in the [[02:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=9041.1s)]
*  past sense, it was, it's really weird. [[02:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=9044.140000000001s)]
*  Like it's like to get used to writing like that it's cause I've never done [[02:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=9046.34s)]
*  anything like that before. [[02:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=9049.34s)]
*  It's like, that was a different experience for me. [[02:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=9050.060000000001s)]
*  Um, but you're talking about like that type of therapy. [[02:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=9052.34s)]
*  Have you seen the type of therapy that's like, let's just say you have like, you [[02:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=9054.94s)]
*  go to therapy right now and like, everyone has certain traumas in their life. [[02:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=9058.86s)]
*  And the theory, I can't remember exactly what it's called, but it's like, like, so [[02:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=9062.300000000001s)]
*  10 year old you, something happened. [[02:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=9067.66s)]
*  Right. [[02:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=9069.980000000001s)]
*  And like that version of you, like that version of you, like the state that you [[02:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=9070.62s)]
*  went into, like to recover from that is still a part of your personality. [[02:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=9074.460000000001s)]
*  And right. [[02:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=9078.1s)]
*  So like, whether it's like, and like how you manage with it. [[02:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=9078.42s)]
*  So like, okay, let me, let's just say you're 10 years is bad. [[02:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=9080.58s)]
*  Let's say like you're a 25 year old and something bad happens and you turn to [[02:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=9083.74s)]
*  drinking or something like that. [[02:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=9086.02s)]
*  Right. [[02:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=9086.980000000001s)]
*  And whenever something bad happens, you kind of go back to that, right. [[02:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=9087.74s)]
*  You go back to that and because like, that's your therapy for it. [[02:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=9090.58s)]
*  So like this goes into, you kind of revisit, you have a conversation with [[02:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=9092.7s)]
*  that 25 year old you and you're like, and then you try to get them to accept it [[02:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=9096.58s)]
*  because like you have these different parts of you inside of you, like for [[02:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=9101.94s)]
*  these different experiences, whether it's like, um, yeah, like that type of [[02:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=9104.02s)]
*  experience or like, I'm trying to explain it the best way I can, but it's like, [[02:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=9107.42s)]
*  you have to have these conversations with this old passive you to kind of let go. [[02:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=9111.7s)]
*  And like, you kind of hold onto stuff. [[02:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=9114.9s)]
*  Ah, interesting. [[02:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=9116.3s)]
*  So you're going back to like a injured part of you or an injured you [[02:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=9116.94s)]
*  and you're trying to help them get through it because like you can't talk to it. [[02:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=9120.02s)]
*  Like it's just say you had a bad call. [[02:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=9122.699999999999s)]
*  Let's get a really bad experience in college, like with a coach or something [[02:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=9124.779999999999s)]
*  like that and they like verbally abused you. [[02:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=9127.34s)]
*  Right. [[02:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=9128.74s)]
*  And like that part of you is like still there. [[02:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=9129.42s)]
*  Like it's, it is so there and like, you go to therapy, you talk about it. [[02:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=9131.18s)]
*  Like if you just kind of hold onto it, that part of you is always still kind [[02:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=9133.74s)]
*  of like this dark anger and so you have to kind of go back there and talk to them [[02:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=9136.3s)]
*  and like talk to that 18 year old self. [[02:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=9141.1s)]
*  Right. [[02:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=9143.38s)]
*  Like almost making amends with your old, with, or like guiding them to the light [[02:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=9143.779999999999s)]
*  maybe sort of, but like just kind of let go of that anger. [[02:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=9147.78s)]
*  Cause if you never talked about it, you just kind of holding on, like you can push [[02:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=9149.86s)]
*  stuff down for so long, but like at some point you got to address it. [[02:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=9153.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=9157.9s)]
*  It says trauma can freeze your emotional response at the age you experienced it [[02:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=9158.1s)]

*  So like I have that, the aura ring stuff and I like seeing my sleep because I either there's like, it tells you how long you slept. [[02:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=9452.82s)]
*  It tells you how well you slept. [[02:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=9459.98s)]
*  And right. [[02:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=9461.9s)]
*  So this is my mindset. [[02:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=9462.3s)]
*  So like rather, if I get like green in one of those areas, Hey, I'm going to have a good day. [[02:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=9463.18s)]
*  Cause whether if let's say I got seven hours of sleep and that's red, but I, 90% of those super good deep sleep and I was healthy. [[02:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=9468.42s)]
*  You're like, okay, I'm going to have a great day today. [[02:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=9475.14s)]
*  Or if they're both in the red, my mindset is now, all right. [[02:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=9477.1s)]
*  I didn't give myself a good advantage today. [[02:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=9480.74s)]
*  So I got to try a little bit harder today because it's going to be a harder day. [[02:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=9482.42s)]
*  Cause I didn't sleep well and I didn't get a lot of hours. [[02:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=9485.1s)]
*  And so like that's like, people are like, well, I don't like to see them. [[02:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=9487.18s)]
*  I'm like, why? [[02:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=9489.34s)]
*  It's just another challenge that you got to accomplish today. [[02:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=9490.099999999999s)]
*  Well, that's a, I mean, I think that almost sums up just your entire approach, man. [[02:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=9492.14s)]
*  You're lucky that you are not lucky. [[02:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=9495.74s)]
*  I mean, obviously, you know, a lot of it comes from your own family experience and some, maybe some of your parents influence and stuff. [[02:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=9497.3s)]
*  But cause a lot of people, I get that number, I'd see that 60 out of 100 or whatever. [[02:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=9503.58s)]
*  Fuck. [[02:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=9509.22s)]
*  I'd start texting, fuck you to everybody right out of the gate, you know, and I'd even text myself. [[02:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=9509.66s)]
*  Fuck you. [[02:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=9513.98s)]
*  I feel you. [[02:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=9514.58s)]
*  No, I don't know, dude. [[02:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=9515.179999999998s)]
*  But then I would let it ruin me as opposed to me saying, okay, today's going to be a little bit more of a challenge. [[02:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=9516.86s)]
*  It's an uphill challenge. [[02:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=9523.02s)]
*  It's uphill, boy. [[02:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=9523.980000000001s)]
*  It's up. [[02:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=9525.34s)]
*  Well, like, so I mean, when you're in like, like right now I'm in the off season, right? [[02:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=9525.62s)]
*  So like one, my competitive, my competitive switch is much lower than when I'm in season. [[02:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=9529.1s)]
*  Um, but like when you're in season and it's a Tuesday night and I have to wake up and I have like, I have six hours of meetings before I go to a walkthrough. [[02:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=9534.62s)]
*  And then I have to go do a practice of plays that I learned at 8 a.m. [[02:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=9543.02s)]
*  that morning and have to study those plays before practice. [[02:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=9546.539999999999s)]
*  Like those six hours, like I can't be off. [[02:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=9548.98s)]
*  Right. [[02:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=9552.02s)]
*  Like that's, I can't be like, I can't let my guy, I can't let the guy next to me down. [[02:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=9552.3s)]
*  And I'm, I'm my expectation for him is that he's going to have, he can be as prepared as he can. [[02:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=9555.14s)]
*  So like, you don't have an, you don't have an option to be off. [[02:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=9558.22s)]
*  And so like, that's how I, that, so you have to find different ways to encourage yourself. [[02:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=9561.14s)]
*  And so, Hey, I had it, Hey, I slept eight hours and it's good. [[02:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=9564.42s)]
*  I'm gonna have a great day today. [[02:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=9568.06s)]
*  Or if it's one's bad, one's good. [[02:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=9569.5s)]
*  Hey, one of them's great. [[02:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=9571.38s)]
*  I'm going to be great. [[02:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=9572.42s)]
*  And then the last one's like, all right, well, I'm just going to kick my own ass today. [[02:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=9572.98s)]
*  Like bring it. [[02:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=9575.38s)]
*  And like, it's like, that's, that's what my mindset has to be now off season. [[02:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=9576.22s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=9579.78s)]
*  I might bitch him on a little bit more, but like it is what it is. [[02:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=9579.98s)]
*  Like I only have so many off days as like, I only have so many days anyways. [[02:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=9582.82s)]
*  So like, I'm gonna, I'm just going to keep going. [[02:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=9585.74s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=9587.7s)]
*  I think you got to give yourself some breaks here and there. [[02:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=9588.62s)]
*  I mean, even if you don't, even if you have a job that doesn't really even [[02:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=9591.06s)]
*  allow that many, you know, and you know, you're gonna take them when you can get them. [[02:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=9593.66s)]
*  It's a high, it's a high competition level you're in. [[02:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=9596.74s)]
*  It's a high competition, a profession. [[02:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=9599.58s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=9601.42s)]

*  hall of fame health, and they have an event and it's at the 1230 club. [[02:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=9726.42s)]
*  And it's there again this year, but this is funny. [[02:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=9729.619999999999s)]
*  So they were auctioning off footballs and there's like, I think there's like six [[02:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=9732.539999999999s)]
*  to 10 NFL guys that were there, but, uh, one of the footballs that got auctioned [[02:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=9735.14s)]
*  off, he bought it and it was signed by, um, Eddie George and George Kittle. [[02:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=9738.78s)]
*  Oh, cool. [[02:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=9744.619999999999s)]
*  It's probably the only football ever signed by us too. [[02:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=9745.18s)]
*  But the fact that his last name is my first name, I just, you don't see that [[02:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=9747.74s)]
*  very often, but I thought that was pretty funny, but yeah, I met him at that event. [[02:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=9751.02s)]
*  It was pretty funny. [[02:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=9754.06s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=9755.18s)]
*  That's it. [[02:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=9755.54s)]
*  I guess that's kind of interesting, I guess, but it doesn't excite you. [[02:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=9756.300000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=9759.62s)]
*  I think it's exciting. [[02:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=9759.78s)]
*  It doesn't excite me much, but it's not. [[02:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=9760.380000000001s)]
*  I mean, I just, George isn't a very common name. [[02:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=9762.94s)]
*  So when I see other people with it, it excites me. [[02:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=9765.02s)]
*  I guess that's true. [[02:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=9766.94s)]
*  And that's very fair actually. [[02:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=9767.9s)]
*  And I shouldn't have said that. [[02:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=9769.42s)]
*  Thank you. [[02:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=9770.54s)]

*  But is George still a pop? [[02:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=9775.22s)]
*  George isn't that popular of a name anymore. [[02:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmuGfrzQsM&t=9777.66s)]
