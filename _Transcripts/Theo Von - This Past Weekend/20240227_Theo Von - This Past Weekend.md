*  he is [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=6.28s)]
*  He is a fighter a kickboxer a artist [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=7.84s)]
*  He it's fascinating to watch him experience the world. He's a damn human van go of some type of sorts [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=13.120000000000001s)]
*  He's had one of the greatest runs as a UFC champion. I'm just grateful to spend time with him today [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=22.52s)]
*  Mr. Israel Adesanya [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=28.08s)]
*  Yeah [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=58.08s)]
*  Yeah, brother chishin good as I'm a look yeah, he's about it healthy eight [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=60.239999999999995s)]
*  I'm an eight. You're pretty happy. You're I mean, they don't have a lot of like [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=67.32s)]
*  Well, let's so fucking go down that road man. I can't call another fighter handsome. Yeah, you can look into I like the hair [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=71.75999999999999s)]
*  if I could [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=77.96s)]
*  Mullet I'd definitely do it like for season really. Yeah, fuck you [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=79.75999999999999s)]
*  Well, they need someone and I don't want to say who but someone of certain culture [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=83.3s)]
*  Yeah, would be neat to see the Jerry curl really? [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=88.89999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I know what you mean. I used to have Jerry curls when I was younger [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=92.58s)]
*  It was a thing maybe in the late 90s early 2000s, but then it's not good for your scalp [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=96.46s)]
*  No, I'm good for you. I know all the chemicals in there you also the last time I did it. I burnt my scalp [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=102.06s)]
*  Oh, yeah, I left it on too long. So then I was like right we're done with that [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=107.34s)]
*  But also it's not good for your scalp for your hair because my hair is meant to be as you say nappy like [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=111.34s)]
*  Texturized, you know, yeah having to burn it out to straighten it and then perm and all that stuff is not [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=116.18s)]
*  Oh, you got to do that. So it's like you got to straighten it and then so the relaxor straightens it and [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=121.86s)]
*  Then you can put the Jerry curl in there and then makes it curly. But yeah, I never had it long [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=127.34s)]
*  I had it short but still I mean a mother would be nice though. Yeah, it'll be a real cool fight [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=132.02s)]
*  Miguel Torres Ricky Simone Ricky Simone. Yeah, he's got a nice one. Yeah a lot of guys at the gym [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=137.58s)]
*  Oh, well, who else Ortega has did he have one? [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=142.9s)]
*  He's had locks like nice Arnold Allen. Did you? [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=146.62s)]
*  I'm trying to think a lot of Kiwi guys like my guy toes him up a lot of the guys and a lot of damn women [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=150.54s)]
*  in this [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=155.82s)]
*  You're not wrong [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=157.82s)]
*  You'll see a grandma with a hatchet in this [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=160.1s)]
*  But it would be awesome on some of the highlight videos just to see the fucking [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=166.22s)]
*  We hit someone bang just over getting hit [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=170.98s)]
*  That's one thing out what I'm grateful for is like because I know it looks worse [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=173.62s)]
*  Sometimes when you have long hair you get hit and maybe even if you roll with the shot. Yeah, the crowd goes. Oh [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=177.5s)]
*  Yeah, and then you're like fuck they thought that bro that a whiz past me but it looked like you go ahead because of the [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=183.68s)]
*  Dude, that's what's interesting about you. You're that intricate to detail that you want to even man it like you want to have a say [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=191.28s)]
*  So and how you even get hit if that makes any sense like how does that look to people? Yeah, you know [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=198.82s)]
*  Like you're such an entertainer. It's like I even want to make that look as perfect as possible [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=204.72s)]
*  Yeah, I try not to get hit but if I'm gonna get hit I mean hit by the best [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=209.95999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, a lot of them so um, and they're always iconic moments [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=214.23999999999998s)]
*  But still like yeah, the game is hit and don't get hit so I can preserve my my noggin [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=218.16s)]
*  Yeah, my brain want to keep this intact so I can keep doing this and I don't have to [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=224.38s)]
*  To [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=230.14s)]
*  You don't want that it's kind of crazy like reporters will totally look over that a guy can't even speak just to be like hey [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=235.45999999999998s)]
*  How do you feel about this? Yeah, I mean, that's why Joe shouts at him. He stopped [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=242.57999999999998s)]
*  interviewing guys after they've been knocked out cuz oh [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=247.85999999999999s)]
*  Really? Yeah, he said that I think it was after one of the over him after the over him fight and over him [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=251.01999999999998s)]
*  There's a famous meme or scenes as I clearly felt a tap [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=256.53999999999996s)]
*  Because he had steep and a guillotine. He thought he tapped but again, he just got rocked [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=260.14s)]
*  So, you know, your brains not really all the I've been knocked out before like cold once shots of perera [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=264.7s)]
*  Yeah, Perera is that he say? Yeah, but it I'll export Tom Perera. Oh, he's a he's he's really yeah [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=271.65999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, of course, yeah, I look people think I'm not an ater man. I'm a guy who [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=280.58s)]
*  We're all in this game together, right? We're all trying to better our [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=286.34s)]
*  Lives for our family and all and generations and all that and he's achieved it [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=290.18s)]
*  You know in the beginning when he first came to the UFC granted [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=294.86s)]
*  He didn't have the run that I had he got to the spot [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=297.74s)]
*  He got because he already beat me in kickboxing and I don't want to hop on too much about this [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=300.3s)]
*  Like I'm but I want to give you the history [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=304.91999999999996s)]
*  For those who don't know okay. Yeah, cuz I'm sure new people will be watching this so they understand [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=307.09999999999997s)]
*  It was literally three nil or to it. No to a note to a note. So technically the first fight [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=311.74s)]
*  I thought I won, you know anyone who watched it [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=317.48s)]
*  Oh, he edged that out and they gave it to him and I was like what okay cool second fight. We go to Brazil [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=320.62s)]
*  Thanks, Sao Paulo beautiful and I was there on kind of all [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=326.71999999999997s)]
*  Man, I was cutting weight so I couldn't be outside [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=330.84s)]
*  But I'll tell you what oh [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=334.96s)]
*  I'll never forget this I go downstairs from the hotel when I get to Sao Paulo because I'm you have to get like a [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=336.68s)]

*  Plug that works, you know [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=343.84s)]
*  And then I my phone was on 1% so I left it in my room. I go downstairs and [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=345.84s)]
*  I'll never forget it [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=350.8s)]
*  I see this guy and two girls and then one of them kind of looked back to see what was behind her and smiled and [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=352.12s)]
*  Just had the most [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=358.68s)]
*  beautiful racial [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=360.36s)]
*  Aesthetics I've ever seen in my life and I remember thinking like fuck. I wish I could capture this moment, but I just [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=361.84s)]
*  Right there I just right there so I think they were hookers though [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=369.92s)]
*  It was getting it was probably like 2 a.m. We landed or something. So he was getting some for to go. Yeah. Yeah [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=374.68s)]
*  But um, yeah that that was beautiful just right there anyway back to the fight so I fight Alex and then [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=383.8s)]
*  Oh, especially getting eaten in a couple days. Oh man, you know, I'm hungry [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=390.0s)]
*  hungry, but um [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=394.44s)]
*  Yeah, I get to the fight [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=396.20000000000005s)]
*  Doing work beating them and then catches me because I rocked him in the second round and third round [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=398.48s)]
*  He just came back rallied up and just caught me flatlining me [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=403.40000000000003s)]
*  That's the only time I've ever been knocked out and was that the kickboxing? Yeah kickbox. Okay, and then yeah when I came [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=406.44s)]
*  I was I came to all and I remember like they were rushing me trying to put oxygen mask on me [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=413.14000000000004s)]
*  I was like, I need that hold up and they tried to take me on a stretcher as well [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=418.36s)]
*  I was like chill champ [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=421.02000000000004s)]
*  It's not that deep [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=423.20000000000005s)]
*  but then I walked to the back and I remember me and you'll just walk silently to the back to this white space and [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=425.2s)]
*  Just kind of like [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=430.28s)]
*  What do you hit me with he goes left hook? [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=432.32s)]
*  He straightaway just told me left hook. So you're handing come back fast enough other. Ah, but again in that [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=434.32s)]
*  That time from being knocked out to that moment having a mic in my face and then so how do you feel about this fight? [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=441.08s)]
*  That wouldn't be ideal. So I'm glad Joe stopped doing that [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=447.84s)]
*  Just so the guys don't have to embarrass themselves or say something that they might regret later on yeah [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=451.44s)]
*  Yeah, I never I didn't think about how crazy that is that they even do that [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=456.64s)]
*  It's almost like you like kind of like when you have to do that dizzy back game [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=460.24s)]
*  You know where you spin your head in my gym [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=463.54s)]
*  We have this drill that we haven't done in a while actually [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=465.34000000000003s)]
*  But the dizzy back game and then you do it ten times then you get up and you have to hit the pads [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=467.96000000000004s)]
*  Just in case you never know in a fight where you might get rocked and then you have to keep your keep your composure [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=474.2s)]
*  So yeah dizzy back game in a you know most times it's like you have to run straight [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=479.26s)]
*  But this one you have to write down one two, ba-ba one two three and you're just [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=482.94s)]
*  But again, that's what it's like when you get rock sometimes and you're just like oh shit [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=486.82s)]
*  You have to keep your composure. So oh, that's interesting [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=490.14s)]
*  It's an old-school drill that the league our boys about more league our boys had so Eugene's done it a few times [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=492.94s)]
*  But I might bring it back for some fun. Actually that might do it for some content. That'd be a good idea [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=497.28s)]
*  It's in it. I feel like it'd be fascinating. I've seen that you ever trade [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=500.86s)]
*  Uh, yeah, I've trained but I'm just a one-stripe white belt. I see nice, but there's still some possibility [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=504.26s)]
*  Like you stole his levels. Yeah [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=509.1s)]
*  Three stripes imagine that fuck you're badass. Oh fuck somebody up outside of it [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=512.78s)]
*  Dude I watched the documentary man, it was really cool. Thank you [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=522.34s)]
*  it was really interesting for you to just like share about like it felt like what it's like to to like [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=525.94s)]
*  Not only kind of to be to have some of your history [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=532.3s)]
*  But then also to like the pressures of how things change once you achieve [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=535.9s)]
*  Your dreams and your goals and then how some of that feels like it doesn't really [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=542.3s)]
*  Fulfill maybe what you thought it was gonna do. Mm-hmm. Yeah [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=548.5s)]
*  Like I could relate to that a time. I'm sure wait, when did you when did you kind of like? [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=552.3s)]
*  Like blow up what what age would you say? I would say like five years ago [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=557.22s)]
*  I think work started getting busier for me probably maybe about five years ago you'd have been here [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=561.34s)]
*  I'm glad I didn't find [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=565.54s)]
*  Fame at a young age like say 25 year old Izzy with everything that I have now bad idea. Yeah [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=568.62s)]
*  Hey Theo bad idea as that sets a story for later on but um, yeah, I'm glad I found fame later on but but still [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=575.66s)]
*  You know, they say be careful what you wish for. Yeah, and I don't regret anything. I'm ready. I prepared for this life, but [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=584.6999999999999s)]
*  It's it's still surprising. Yeah, there's levels. There's all these variables you don't expect and [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=591.9s)]
*  I've kind of set myself up now to the point where okay, I've expressed enough like how I example [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=597.38s)]
*  What's one? Um after the UFC two three two four three in Melbourne. I defended my belt against Whitaker against Whitaker [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=604.9s)]
*  So I defended my belt the first time I like to put it and then [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=611.9s)]
*  Going to the airport. I remember just thinking in the car like fuck cuz I was kind of just is so much stimulus [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=615.62s)]
*  Because I just did what I did and still the to this date the highest attendance in UFC history was six [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=621.58s)]
*  57,000 127 people and [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=627.7s)]
*  All these everywhere I went, you know, it was just crazy even the week fight week [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=630.5s)]
*  I went down the strip just walked alone just cuz I was like, let me enjoy this while I can [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=635.98s)]
*  You know cuz I didn't know how long I would have that for I can still do it now [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=640.26s)]
*  But because I have boundaries now, I didn't have that for a long time [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=643.66s)]
*  But what I did on the way to the airport going back to NZ [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=647.26s)]
*  I just put out a thing on my story or tweet just saying I look if you see me at the airport [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=649.66s)]
*  Just approached me cautiously. You don't have to come yelling because when we all oh my god, yes, very scary [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=653.6999999999999s)]
*  Sometimes you think you're on fire the bit in the movie where I didn't even plan it and they just kind of like drove [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=660.5799999999999s)]
*  By and I'm like, what the fuck? Oh, yeah, it raised my adrenaline up and then they came to my door and [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=666.1s)]
*  that's why I moved houses because people would just come to my door and oh [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=671.18s)]
*  My god, and this is like 9 p.m. At night I'm like yo and that's a [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=675.38s)]
*  some key [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=679.78s)]
*  Guys try to sell me a watch once [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=682.46s)]
*  Hold up and I went upstairs came back down. I was like I already got this watch bro [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=686.22s)]
*  There's a g-shock like a black and gold one classic. But then for me, I just boundaries [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=691.18s)]
*  I had to learn boundaries for myself. Yeah, cuz you burn out [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=696.38s)]
*  Yeah, it's earned you after I do any kind of media stuff or anything with fans [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=698.98s)]
*  My people just know my friends my security they just know okay [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=703.9s)]
*  I just go to my room and I just read regroup or replenish my social battery if you will and I'm sure you've had to [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=707.1s)]
*  Deal with this as well. Yeah, I didn't know that I had to do that when it like about two and a half years ago [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=712.78s)]
*  Things were going well, you know, I was like [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=717.46s)]
*  Being able to sell tickets and stuff and just like you work so hard for it [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=720.0600000000001s)]
*  You know and I didn't know like I would go meet every fan after I didn't know I [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=724.38s)]
*  Felt like I it was I could never do enough. Yeah to make people think that I was enough [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=729.9s)]
*  No, you got it. There's more they'll never there's never enough cuz it's good you give them an inch. I'll take a mile [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=735.5s)]
*  I haven't stopped signing. Um [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=740.8000000000001s)]
*  These are guys who just come camp at the fighter hotel. I don't even stay at the fighter hotel anymore [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=742.82s)]
*  I always get my own space now just cuz I [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=747.7s)]
*  Remember like oh, can you sign this please and then they'll have like a stack of shit? Oh, totally [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=750.08s)]
*  And then you know, I didn't want to be the bad guy [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=754.14s)]
*  So I'd signed everything but got to a point where I might hang on that's not just for you [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=756.92s)]
*  You're selling that and you know, just be honest [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=761.14s)]
*  But again, don't take the piss and have like 20 fucking gloves for me to sign. I'm like, yo [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=763.72s)]
*  I know you're not you're just on this for my daughter. You saw this from like my grandson [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=768.24s)]
*  Oh my god, they're when they use their kids months old. I don't like it when they use their kids [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=772.68s)]
*  Yeah Trojan horse they come with the kid on my [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=776.02s)]
*  Don't I don't mind. Do you want to take a picture? [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=779.06s)]
*  Cuz sometimes the kid would be like the fuck's this guy [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=781.28s)]
*  Yeah, do you want to take a picture or does your dad want to take a picture? [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=783.8199999999999s)]
*  Cuz if he just said oh bro, I'm a big fan, you know, can't take a picture. That's cool [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=787.42s)]
*  But again, it's just boundaries boundaries and respect like I just came back from the gym [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=791.3199999999999s)]
*  I actually go to a public gym once in a while now cuz after the last lockdown [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=795.7199999999999s)]
*  Again, I come out into the world and people are all locked down. They excited the energy was always just [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=802.0s)]
*  And I just didn't know how to deal with it cuz again, I'm human [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=808.0s)]
*  And I'd get really anxious and sometimes a little bit short with my fuse. Oh me too for sure, bro [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=811.1999999999999s)]
*  What the fuck like come? Yeah, let's take a photo but chill and I realized now I gotta fix this [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=817.4s)]
*  So I went to a public gym just cuz I was like immersed myself in people and again, I'd have to tell people [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=821.5999999999999s)]
*  Not right now. I'm working. So that was my way of learning the reps of saying no [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=827.2399999999999s)]
*  You have to learn how to say no because if you don't say no [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=831.3199999999999s)]
*  They'll just take they'll take and they'll hold you hostage with their conversation as well. Yeah, I don't like that [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=834.68s)]
*  Oh, they're like we face time my stepmother's dying, you know [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=839.64s)]
*  What am I gonna do tell us some jokes and then I get on there and she's like [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=847.5s)]
*  Give a fuck she has bigger problems. She's trying to die. Yeah, she's trying. Yeah, she's trying [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=854.5s)]
*  She's trying to like hide whatever bad stuff is left in her home [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=861.18s)]
*  And now she has to like pretend that we can talk [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=866.26s)]
*  But no, I just found it to be fascinating because I ever thought that once I got to a certain part of success [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=869.74s)]
*  Maybe or if enough people knew me [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=876.5s)]
*  I thought everything inside of me would be cool and it bro it when it wasn't it I mean it knocked me out [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=879.1s)]
*  Because I was like if this doesn't fix whatever is going on inside of me then I don't know what else could fix it [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=886.8199999999999s)]
*  You know, it's never external. It's always here [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=892.88s)]
*  Internal so I had to learn that from watching other people like example Rashad Evans when he won the belt [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=895.94s)]
*  UFC 92 he said [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=902.82s)]
*  Just he thought it would be different but nah didn't feel any different. He just felt [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=905.7800000000001s)]
*  Meh kind of like okay, I've done it and I felt the same way [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=910.46s)]
*  So when I won the belt I was I would did it feel different [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=913.6400000000001s)]
*  I was like I still feel the same because I always felt like I was the best [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=916.26s)]
*  I always said this is just a fancy tiara. It comes with me. Just keep winning [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=919.46s)]
*  So I never chased a belt ever. I've never chased a belt [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=924.36s)]
*  I've never even identified myself on my bio or to people as unless for promo [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=927.62s)]
*  I say UFC middleweight champion, but apart from that, no, I just I know who I am [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=933.78s)]
*  So I never I don't the belt doesn't make me I make the belt [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=938.66s)]
*  I'm still mean look how many people are calling me out and I'm not even the champion currently [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=943.0600000000001s)]
*  I'm Israel dissing. I feel like my name has transcended the belt itself [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=947.74s)]
*  I don't need the belt to show I'm a champion because how you carry yourself is is what makes you a champion [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=952.36s)]
*  Yeah, I'm still learning though constantly every day [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=957.52s)]
*  You know, that's what I got from the documentary too. It was cool, man. It was inspiring. It was inspiring [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=960.96s)]
*  Appreciate that it really was man because a lot of that I could relate to too [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=965.2s)]
*  Like I remember like when I was growing up, I just wanted to be singing [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=968.72s)]
*  I remember you saying that at one point and it was like for some reason I just I was like [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=971.8000000000001s)]
*  I'm gonna make people see me and I don't even know what it meant or anything [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=977.0400000000001s)]
*  It was just it was like a like a lighthouse that was inside of me. I just got like were you a bully? [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=981.42s)]
*  I wasn't a bully. I just didn't get any attention now this haircut [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=988.14s)]
*  You're like the same size [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=995.14s)]
*  Give me your lunch. Look I was feared in a lot of softball circles because of my haircut. They're like this guy's dangerous [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=997.8199999999999s)]
*  Yeah [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=1004.02s)]
*  But no, I think I just did I think I just felt like I didn't want anything to define me except for me [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=1008.0799999999999s)]
*  Yeah, that was like cute [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=1014.4s)]
*  It was like and I don't even know where it came from [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=1016.0s)]
*  But it was like I didn't want to attach myself to anything. I wanted to walk to school and not take the bus [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=1017.72s)]
*  I didn't want anybody determining [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=1023.12s)]
*  The only way you were gonna learn about me was through me. Wow, that was it. There was nobody else you could add there was it was all [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=1026.04s)]
*  Especially my voice was the only thing that I had that was mine. Yeah, and so it was like I'm gonna use this [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=1033.14s)]
*  Are you an only child? No, I got three siblings, but I think I felt like an only human probably [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=1038.4s)]
*  Oh, I felt like an only human a lot of like solitude [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=1043.74s)]
*  We're growing up. Yeah, just a lot of like lack of connection and like with family just like felt like I was in my own world [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=1046.7s)]

*  Fighting and a lot of violence and it was like it just didn't feel like anything [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=1072.32s)]
*  So it felt like I'm never gonna let anything define me again [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=1076.1999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, you know not like God got me one time with where I'm born, you know, like yeah [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=1079.52s)]

*  Because I like to move and also when you move sometimes a new thought can come into your head [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=2343.7799999999997s)]
*  Because you hit a motion, and that's what keeps me inspired [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=2348.7s)]

*  Use your instrument it will use you kind of in a way and you know sometimes I feel like a sword yeah [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=2368.4s)]

*  But they can be a little less exciting yeah [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=2400.9s)]
*  Especially for the fans because they're being there since five hours six hours drinking and they just like standing my ref [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=2403.84s)]

*  That's the thing and how many UFC fights and people think oh he's about to get exposed in this fight [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=2416.64s)]
*  It's like I show the person would know yawn, but he didn't do anything [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=2422.32s)]
*  He just used his weight then try and finish me yeah, really try and beat me up to the last like eight seconds [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=2425.7799999999997s)]
*  But yeah, he just wanted to win the round so he kept me and use his weight [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=2431.06s)]
*  And I wasn't really used to that at the at the minute at the time so um it's a good point [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=2434.2599999999998s)]
*  Yeah, Costa couldn't catch a lot of the guys. They can't catch you so you can't say hey this guy doesn't like to go to the ground [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=2439.58s)]
*  It's like well if you can't get him on the ground. He shouldn't lay down there meet a guy down there [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=2445.46s)]
*  What am I gonna do but scoot like come on, buddy? [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=2449.8199999999997s)]

*  I enjoy the clinch I enjoy I enjoy the ground as well [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=2458.42s)]
*  But in the gym it's different than in a fight [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=2461.84s)]
*  And I'm getting more comfortable on the ground in the gym which makes me you know even better in a fight [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=2464.76s)]
*  But um yeah, just no one's being able to like take me and keep me there to see anything [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=2469.52s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, that shouldn't be like yeah, that's not a fault of yours. It's interesting cuz I don't you'll just hear a lead [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=2475.8s)]

*  But I just know I know I'm the shit but I know ain't shit. That's like a good balance to have it's always fluctuating [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=3385.58s)]
*  I know I'm the shit and sometimes I ain't shit. So it's a good it's a good balance [[00:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=3391.54s)]
*  I think it's a good balance for anybody it is and yeah, you're right [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=3396.02s)]
*  I think the society here maybe they have a different approach to some of that [[00:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=3399.54s)]
*  But and maybe some of that needs to evolve, you know, but yeah [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=3404.02s)]
*  Yeah, I think it's it's okay to [[00:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=3407.32s)]
*  You're just learning about your own spirit. And how do I navigate this? [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=3410.2200000000003s)]
*  No one gave me a book of me like this is how you now you're famous. Here's what you do [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=3413.92s)]
*  Nah, even me sometimes I might not be in the mood. I might be having a shit day the day my cat died [[00:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=3418.52s)]
*  I was having a really shit day and a guy at the gas station again was oh my god, bro, bro [[00:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=3424.44s)]
*  Hold up. Hold up. It's poor Adesanya. Bro. Can you talk my cuz I'm like [[00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=3429.38s)]
*  Bro, my cat just died this morning [[00:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=3432.96s)]
*  I'm not and he's like, oh good G. Oh, I'm like and I know you bad and I give me the phone and then I grabbed [[00:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=3435.54s)]
*  The phone I was talking to him. I was like, wait, hang on. They got I'm pumping gas like fuck go away [[00:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=3442.02s)]
*  I was like bro, and then I'm a bad guy forever. And then that's the only story they have about me [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=3446.5800000000004s)]
*  But again, I'm comfortable with that now when people have a bad story about me [[00:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=3450.86s)]
*  I'm like they probably deserved it because when people bring manners and respect I reflect that back and they get more out of me [[00:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=3454.1600000000003s)]
*  I stick around with them and I even if [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=3460.7000000000003s)]
*  Even if I'm too I'm in a rush. I still try and make people feel seen [[00:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=3463.74s)]
*  Yeah, I still want to make them feel like we connected. Yeah, you know just even for a brief moment like bro [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=3468.42s)]
*  I'm gonna do photos right now. I'm in a rush, but I love you. I love you. I love you and I just move [[00:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=3473.2799999999997s)]
*  Yeah, but again, I'll try and connect with them and let them know I really appreciate you [[00:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=3477.2599999999998s)]
*  But I think it's a bet that you can do man. I really do. I'm human. Yeah [[00:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=3481.06s)]
*  I'm human and it's a crazy thing that you don't learn how to be and it's [[00:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=3485.06s)]
*  There's there's so many like nice parts about it, but there's there's parts about it that are [[00:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=3489.3s)]
*  Like especially nowadays with like the virulence of things you can't ever [[00:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=3494.38s)]
*  Go back, you know, and so then it's um, anyway, we're gonna start to sound like a couple [[00:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=3499.6200000000003s)]
*  But thing is it's relatable it's to you and me it's relatable because you you live this life as well [[00:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=3508.1s)]
*  I don't get to talk about this with most people. That's a good point man [[00:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=3513.2000000000003s)]
*  My friends they can understand cuz they see it, you know, but most people don't get it [[00:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=3515.62s)]
*  Yeah, they'll never get it because they're not in this position [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=3520.42s)]
*  Yeah, I've been afraid just like I've been afraid sometimes to get like like I have a nice home [[00:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=3523.06s)]
*  You know, I've been afraid to like even go look sometimes like a real like fancy home or something or maybe they had a little bit [[00:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=3527.1s)]
*  More space or a garage or I could put two cars or something, you know, like you can only put one in your garage now [[00:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=3533.06s)]
*  Yeah, really? So I just like cuz I think there's a big part of me that humble [[00:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=3537.6s)]
*  Well, it's like I don't know who would I be [[00:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=3543.2200000000003s)]
*  Yeah, I don't know how I who I am if I'm in this if you find the extra space for the car [[00:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=3545.5s)]
*  Yeah, I think it's like I just I know I it's [[00:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=3551.46s)]
*  so much of my life I've been able to like [[00:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=3555.46s)]
*  Like manage what's going on and it's gotten a little bit tougher for sure over the past few years [[00:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=3558.7400000000002s)]
*  But I'm like if I had another element then will I even know my like am I gonna get further away from like you'll be fine [[00:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=3564.5s)]
*  Myself I guess knowing who you are you'd be fine. You'd be able to handle having a nicer house [[00:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=3571.72s)]
*  It's just bit things are easier, you know, but [[00:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=3576.04s)]
*  Money would have changed me if it was gonna change me would have changed me years ago probably about [[00:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=3579.68s)]
*  Four years ago, it would have changed me if money was gonna change me [[00:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=3586.12s)]
*  You get to a certain point when you make so many [[00:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=3589.96s)]
*  M's and you just like it doesn't really matter cuz you're already as long as I can put a full tank of gas in [[00:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=3593.2s)]
*  I don't even check the price of gas. I just put a full tank in that's when I know I'm good [[00:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=3598.22s)]

*  That's when I know I'm comfortable and as long as I can do that, I'm good. Anything else is just bonuses [[01:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=3619.5s)]
*  Yeah, you know, it's just bonuses [[01:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=3625.16s)]

*  But I do I do appreciate the fame because it brought me this life [[01:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=3629.2599999999998s)]

*  Move this entertainer along so more people can see him. Yeah, you know [[01:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=3645.0s)]

*  No, it's interesting well [[01:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=3760.52s)]

*  And that's when I started for the first time in my life before that I'd been kind of a bad bad [[01:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=3768.04s)]
*  It wasn't crazy bad, but it was getting like a little bit. You were just living your life [[01:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=3772.8399999999997s)]

*  So I got afraid to have a beer because I was worried I would have cocaine one leads to the other [[01:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=3780.96s)]
*  Yeah, and I never had a drinking problem, but I was just if I do have a beer then if somebody has cocaine [[01:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=3785.24s)]

*  Then there was some reports [[01:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=3802.24s)]
*  I couldn't speak about it then because it was still an ongoing court case [[01:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=3803.7599999999998s)]
*  But then there was reports coming out saying he was two times over the legal limit and all this and there's no excuse [[01:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=3806.58s)]

*  The head looks too cute I think their their PR is so cute you're like happy feet. Yeah. Yeah [[01:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=3951.96s)]
*  Sorry happy feet [[01:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=3960.16s)]
*  Yeah, they're the damn French Bulldogs of the North, you know actual yeah, they kind of look like that without the face [[01:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=3961.76s)]
*  Yes, and maybe I don't know but I'm I got to email him back [[01:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=3967.58s)]
*  but yeah, so when you do look at like so you've had some time off and stuff when you [[01:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=3970.2400000000002s)]
*  Was it like did you want to recalibrate what you because you've? [[01:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=3974.88s)]
*  You've gotten to achieve your dreams right and there's something over and over and over again [[01:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=3978.94s)]
*  Yeah, like I mean it's unprecedented, you know, like you've you mastered what you set out to do [[01:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=3983.58s)]
*  So then it's interesting because now you're a master [[01:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=3989.9s)]
*  Who is? [[01:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=3993.14s)]
*  Who's already achieved everything you can achieve in the game, but there's still more that I want to do for myself, right? [[01:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=3994.98s)]
*  That's one. All right [[01:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=4001.58s)]
*  I guess I'm wondering like how does that how do you start to separate those two and what is that even you know? [[01:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=4002.1800000000003s)]
*  Master the game yet. I'm still learning every day even right now [[01:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=4006.8999999999996s)]
*  we're working again on my jab because [[01:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=4009.66s)]
*  I'm changing it up now because there's so much footage on me people can watch the smart coaches and they can kind of game plan [[01:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=4012.06s)]
*  Like my question mark it was fucking everyone up early on [[01:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=4019.22s)]
*  Got to like maybe after the rubber Whitaker fight, maybe the Romero fight. No cost the fight [[01:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=4022.4199999999996s)]
*  Actually cost it avoided it, but he he didn't fall he fell for a different kick [[01:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=4028.3399999999997s)]
*  But um, so from that fight people kind of like know the question marks coming so they all scared of it my jab [[01:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=4032.4199999999996s)]
*  Was vicious still is but I'm just bringing it back. I'm tuning it up again [[01:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=4038.98s)]
*  So it's it's it's constant evolution constant learning every time and my grappling as well. I want to show it off [[01:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=4042.56s)]
*  I do want to show it off in the cage [[01:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=4048.06s)]
*  I did a little bit in my fight with Alex in New York a little bit but um, you want to more [[01:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=4049.62s)]
*  Yeah, I want to let things you want to do. Okay. Oh, well fuck the belt and all that. It's more about highlights [[01:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=4055.66s)]
*  Yeah for me. I'm a highlight guy. Yeah, I know that's what's interesting. It's like that's what I was wondering [[01:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=4061.48s)]
*  I was like does he miss some of the trash talking and just the fucking you know, like when it's raw when it's honest [[01:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=4066.68s)]
*  Yeah, like me and Costa it was good cuz I didn't like the guy. He didn't like me [[01:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=4072.18s)]
*  Is anything watching? [[01:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=4077.08s)]
*  Whatever [[01:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=4080.28s)]
*  Yeah [[01:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=4081.32s)]
*  so again like he's a guy that when I fought him and [[01:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=4082.28s)]
*  again [[01:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=4085.2000000000003s)]
*  I had a lackluster performance against Romero because he didn't want to engage so people were like [[01:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=4085.7000000000003s)]
*  Fuck him and it was I have the most exciting title fight in history and the most boring title fight in history. I do it all [[01:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=4090.4s)]
*  But um after that fight people were talking shit like oh this and that right around a rod [[01:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=4098.52s)]
*  He's a boring fighter and it's weird. I see it now. They just forget they forget and I'm like I gave you so much classics [[01:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=4103.08s)]
*  So quick people forget man. Yeah, but then um for me when that fight came about I [[01:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=4109.88s)]
*  Didn't like him and he reminded me of every joke. Oh, yeah [[01:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=4114.8s)]
*  Very you know good looking [[01:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=4119.64s)]
*  Yeah, oh brother guy and he was talking so much everyone and then the streets was like he went three rounds of Romero [[01:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=4125.160000000001s)]
*  He went three rounds around like yeah, I went five rounds of Merrill. He didn't do shit fucking [[01:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=4131.200000000001s)]
*  I was like, I can't watch this watch this so when I fought him, I remember I just I was so I was dialed in bro [[01:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=4135.360000000001s)]
*  I was dying watching that we went to after the show [[01:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=4141.700000000001s)]
*  We went to a bar think we're in Indiana somewhere [[01:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=4144.76s)]
*  We're in the apex at the time not the apex of the fight island. That was a fight island. And yeah, I am I took him out [[01:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=4146.9800000000005s)]
*  I took him for a ride. I took it [[01:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=4153.280000000001s)]
*  No, he didn't touch me once apart from the legs. I did seeing that. Yeah, and he just approved 100% [[01:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=4156.76s)]
*  Well, it's also in some cultures. It's more it's dominance. It's just more appropriate to yeah [[01:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=4162.400000000001s)]
*  But I mean like for me, I just felt there was the most dominating thing I could do to him because he was in that position [[01:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=4167.88s)]
*  So yeah in Brazil being engaged just like two guys dancing. Yeah, or just high five. Yeah [[01:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=4172.4s)]
*  Technique look at the squat on the man [[01:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=4180.88s)]
*  It was a good time I enjoyed it no regrets what did you think of his of his fight with Whitaker? [[01:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=4188.92s)]
*  It's good fight. I liked it. I liked this jab in that fight [[01:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=4194.36s)]
*  Yeah, I was like, okay he came back but man that earned in the first round when you when you rock them with the wheel kick [[01:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=4196.44s)]
*  Yeah, whoo did not expect that and then again at the end of the round [[01:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=4201.12s)]
*  So he got saved by the bell came back and Whitaker just just out guts them. He just out guts him [[01:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=4205.48s)]
*  I thought it was close. I thought maybe me maybe Costa might have won [[01:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=4211.32s)]
*  I felt he might have won but then when he gave to Whitaker, I was like, huh? [[01:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=4214.58s)]
*  Okay, well wasn't a robbery, but I thought Costa probably had it [[01:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=4218.16s)]
*  Yeah, he was good. He looked good in that fight. He's he wasn't the same after this [[01:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=4222.5199999999995s)]
*  Everyone keeps telling me that you ruin that man. Really you think that? [[01:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=4227.04s)]
*  I don't think after that fight. He wasn't the same. He was on a run. He had this [[01:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=4231.68s)]
*  I'll tell you this you look at the fight [[01:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=4236.36s)]
*  you look at the first round the way he looked at me and they look at the second round when he's like [[01:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=4238.24s)]
*  Like you see his face the demeanor changed I love those moments you take their soul away [[01:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=4244.5599999999995s)]
*  You just know like this guy knows he doesn't want to be locked in here with me [[01:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=4249.5599999999995s)]
*  It's like during a video game, but their controllers gone. Yeah [[01:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=4252.8s)]
*  Bad dream for him bad dream for him. So it's like yeah, I like that moment [[01:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=4256.080000000001s)]
*  Um, but yeah, I like the guy he's funny. He's I think he's entertainer [[01:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=4261.6s)]
*  He's good on Twitter. He's got a secret juice secret juice and all that. It's fun. There's there's so many uh [[01:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=4265.06s)]
*  That's one thing. I was wondering do you miss sometimes just in the past year being off or so? [[01:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=4273.360000000001s)]
*  like do you miss some of the entertain like [[01:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=4277.360000000001s)]
*  like cuz there's been a lot of great like the trash talk and everything's that it kind of like, you know, like like [[01:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=4279.820000000001s)]
*  Strickland so ridiculous like him and MGK are you like that shit is why it's hilarious though [[01:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=4284.88s)]
*  Yeah, do you laugh at some of it like like it's just I really I didn't really pay attention to us [[01:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=4290.14s)]
*  Oh Strickland, I mean strictly you put him in public. It's a it's a different story [[01:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=4294.8s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah, he's always got something to say man. Yeah [[01:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=4299.64s)]
*  Is that a fight that you feel like you want to go like a hundred percent? Yeah hundred percent. Come on, man [[01:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=4303.76s)]
*  I don't know. I don't know what like if guys get like that's it [[01:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=4308.400000000001s)]
*  I care about going in bit revisiting that not because of the fight but just because you care not care [[01:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=4312.68s)]
*  So for me when Pereira beat me, he beat me the first time I went to Brazil [[01:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=4317.76s)]
*  He beat me knocked me out and I didn't chase it [[01:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=4321.860000000001s)]
*  I was like, you know what? I'm done with kickboxing and then he said he got motivated because he saw me [[01:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=4325.240000000001s)]
*  You know talking about him and then decided I'm gonna go MMA and chase this guy and he did and then go to the [[01:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=4331.68s)]
*  UFC they fast-tracked him. He got to me [[01:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=4338.240000000001s)]
*  And yeah, I mean it is what it is. I don't blame them. It was a look at what we have now. We have classics. So [[01:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=4340.62s)]
*  He beat me and it's almost similar fashion in the way I was beating his ass and then in the last round [[01:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=4348.3s)]
*  He just had that spirit and just [[01:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=4353.46s)]
*  Something behind him some kind of Shinigami. He just came and just beat me and I was just like fuck again [[01:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=4355.66s)]
*  How is this guy and then I let it go and then I just knew this is the last one like after this [[01:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=4361.7s)]
*  I'm done with this guy, but I have to get him now [[01:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=4367.38s)]
*  I have to get him now and in that moment when I when I got it done, I got it done [[01:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=4369.76s)]
*  It took me six years and then I went after his kids to yeah [[01:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=4373.22s)]
*  Where you at? Because I'm a petty motherfucker. Sometimes you want to end, you know, just let the lineage know what's up [[01:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=4377.78s)]
*  Of course not like cuz you don't want their kid fighting your kid at school or something [[01:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=4382.38s)]
*  Yeah, I won't even go to the same school. But like the fact is I have to teach his kids a lesson because of what they did prior and [[01:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=4386.02s)]
*  This took me what six years to accomplish was strictly and it won't take me that long [[01:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=4392.5s)]
*  Let me just get through DDP first, let me handle I look I look to the next fight never I look ahead like a little [[01:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=4396.620000000001s)]
*  Peak at the future, but I don't try and focus on it [[01:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=4404.8s)]
*  And I just know the strictly if I will come back around and I'm in a good place now health-wise [[01:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=4407.42s)]
*  Mentally, and I know exactly what happened in that fight. That just wasn't for me. He's a great fighter put up [[01:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=4413.860000000001s)]
*  He's also a good champion [[01:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=4419.58s)]
*  What a rain? I mean he did what he did [[01:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=4421.34s)]
*  Yeah [[01:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=4424.56s)]
*  But I mean like he did what he did [[01:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=4425.88s)]
*  Everybody can beat me outside [[01:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=4428.04s)]
*  I mean I did what he did look even the way he beat me. It was spectacular. It was his moment [[01:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=4430.04s)]
*  It was his moment. Yeah, like sometimes Dave Chappelle said something in this dreamer special. He said oh [[01:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=4434.42s)]
*  How did he put it? Hold up? I got I have it saved here. I have to find it [[01:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=4441.120000000001s)]
*  Then I have it saved here. Give me two seconds up or player right now in five four three [[01:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=4445.3s)]
*  Two one [[01:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=4452.240000000001s)]
*  They said that in the new special I think dreamer and I felt that I was like yeah cuz look [[01:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=4471.240000000001s)]
*  Life is a game. I would use as a Monaco of player one and [[01:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=4479.46s)]
*  Even people sometimes think oh, he's so [[01:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=4484.86s)]
*  Nostalgic he thinks he's player one like don't you are you a bot like? [[01:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=4488.54s)]
*  Everyone can grab the controller and play the fucking game, but most people don't most people [[01:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=4494.18s)]
*  I'm sure you see it most people just go through life [[01:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=4498.22s)]
*  Just on the programming they just go with the flow whatever it's good to go with the flow [[01:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=4500.78s)]
*  But whose flow are you going with? Oh, yeah, so for me, I had to like pause and question everything and I realized [[01:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=4505.56s)]

*  You know what they tell me and over time through life. I've had moments when I've done stuff, and I'm just like why did I do that? [[01:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=5356.3s)]
*  What did I feel that way and then again? [[01:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=5364.22s)]
*  I call it like you identified a monster that you can kill it so once I identify the feeling of you know [[01:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=5366.82s)]
*  Maybe envy or anger or sadness. I'm like why am I feeling this way and I can [[01:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=5372.299999999999s)]
*  Backwards engineer it or something so go go into that a little bit because I think that's important man because I think a lot [[01:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=5378.0599999999995s)]
*  Of people deal with that mm-hmm [[01:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=5382.9s)]
*  So say if somebody's kind of going through that like what like what kind of process you kind of talking about okay? [[01:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=5384.259999999999s)]
*  So if you can have if um [[01:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=5388.78s)]
*  say [[01:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=5391.219999999999s)]
*  Okay [[01:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=5392.5s)]
*  It's it takes a skill to be happy for someone and I've noticed this because when I was younger and growing up in NZ [[01:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=5393.74s)]
*  The culture kind of caught me a little bit where if someone's doing well [[01:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=5399.42s)]
*  You know it might it might look like [[01:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=5403.22s)]
*  Because I noticed myself one of my friends old friend [[01:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=5407.0599999999995s)]
*  I noticed myself like distancing myself away from him because he was doing so well [[01:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=5410.0199999999995s)]
*  Yeah, and then I realized I was like wait hang on so I had to kind of cuz I was out [[01:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=5414.9s)]
*  This my boy. I was like why am I? [[01:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=5419.5s)]
*  Why am I feeling this way? [[01:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=5422.58s)]
*  Why am I feeling like I'm jealous of him when he's not doing anything to me? [[01:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=5424.0199999999995s)]
*  And I've seen people do it to me as well the bigger [[01:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=5428.94s)]
*  I got it kept on getting people who start must be nice type type shit [[01:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=5431.0599999999995s)]
*  You know yeah like oh, and then you see them start to treat me differently [[01:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=5434.74s)]
*  So for me I thought I noticed myself starting to treat him differently and distance myself from him [[01:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=5438.54s)]
*  So I pulled the brakes [[01:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=5442.28s)]
*  Sat with it for a few weeks probably and just kind of identify like why I should be happy for him [[01:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=5444.74s)]
*  And it takes a skill to learn that and then becomes your second nature over time once you become like reps reps reps reps [[01:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=5449.78s)]
*  Because to learn to be a hater was just natural in the environment [[01:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=5456.099999999999s)]
*  I was in so I had to learn nah [[01:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=5460.74s)]
*  That's not the way I want to be so you can unlearn behaviors as well even as I get older things [[01:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=5462.82s)]
*  Yeah, things were even women I have to unlearn certain behaviors and be like yeah, you have to know like this is [[01:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=5467.9s)]
*  Maybe approaching that being more honest or being more communicative and all that kind of stuff you have to unlearn [[01:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=5474.38s)]
*  And constantly learn new ways of being [[01:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=5479.74s)]
*  When you [[01:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=5484.26s)]
*  When you look at the UFC today like who really kind of [[01:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=5486.54s)]
*  Excites you like other guys you're like oh, this is fun. I like this storyline like [[01:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=5490.7s)]
*  Are you able to get a different look at it being away from it a little bit like do you have yeah? [[01:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=5496.26s)]
*  Thing is before the UFC. I watched everything I would watch all the embeddeds all the countdowns all the shows [[01:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=5500.26s)]
*  They have on the UFC websites. I would watch everything but then [[01:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=5507.54s)]
*  Even when I was in it. I was watching everything but then over time [[01:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=5512.54s)]
*  I'm starting to understand sometimes the way [[01:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=5517.42s)]
*  Maybe Nate and Nick Diaz feel because you've you've you've done so much for this game [[01:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=5520.58s)]
*  You've put so much in this game, and then you still feel sometimes [[01:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=5525.82s)]
*  Disrespected and then you just like man fuck this shit like fuck this game [[01:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=5529.82s)]
*  But I because I don't remember the last time I watched the countdown I remember the last time I watched I don't even [[01:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=5534.219999999999s)]
*  Watch the embeddeds anymore. I've kind of like it's played out to me in a way [[01:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=5539.139999999999s)]
*  But I was watching it when I was coming up and that that helped me a lot because when I got to the UFC [[01:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=5543.9s)]
*  It was I just knew what to expect. I was oh yeah, I've seen this before oh, I see yeah [[01:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=5548.299999999999s)]
*  Well cuz at that point you're also surveying this like of the stage [[01:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=5553.7s)]
*  So you know like I know where the cameras here. I know where to look up right there [[01:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=5556.54s)]
*  Why I have these moments man these people think it's all it's all like not a chance [[01:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=5560.38s)]
*  No, I have these moments cuz again the shower I operate there [[01:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=5564.14s)]
*  And I just know like example the speech I gave after I knocked out Alex. I remember being in the shower [[01:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=5567.38s)]
*  visualizing winning in Miami and just like [[01:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=5573.18s)]
*  Cuz I I put myself I immersed myself because of my imagination in that moment [[01:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=5577.5s)]
*  I remember feeling so happy and in that moment. I was like I just fuck [[01:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=5581.9800000000005s)]
*  I just want everyone to feel how happy I am and that's all I wanted to say yeah [[01:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=5586.5s)]
*  And then the rest came vessel. I was just like blah blah blah blah, and I just said what I said and [[01:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=5590.38s)]
*  People fuck with it, and it became this moment [[01:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=5597.3s)]
*  And I'm glad I'm glad I became that moment because people still does to this day. That's like man [[01:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=5599.34s)]

*  I'm yeah, but like I think from doing it over time now with reps even one of my my boys is a [[01:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=5629.14s)]
*  I was one I was a groomsman at this wedding. I didn't write shit for the speech [[01:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=5636.02s)]
*  I just spoke from the heart and I was like man. I killed that shit [[01:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=5640.46s)]
*  and yeah, it's [[01:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=5644.02s)]

*  They weren't caught by the media because then one thing is like sometimes if someone goes through something [[01:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=6340.76s)]
*  You want to go through it alone without the world watching you because there's already like a magnifying glass on your life [[01:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynRJMIjlqSQ&t=6347.96s)]
