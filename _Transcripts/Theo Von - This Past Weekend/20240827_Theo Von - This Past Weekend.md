*  um, just let him know I was thankful for his time. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SRzc6YnT3A&t=1126.5s)]
*  And, and then we sat down and sorry if this is getting boring. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SRzc6YnT3A&t=1130.0600000000002s)]
*  I'm just trying to think, uh, we sat down and yeah, and then, yeah, we just [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SRzc6YnT3A&t=1136.14s)]
*  went through the interview, you know? [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SRzc6YnT3A&t=1141.74s)]
*  Um, and I thought one thing that was nice, I thought it was nice that he said [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SRzc6YnT3A&t=1144.46s)]
*  that his, uh, son, um, had, had, uh, had been the plug to have me come in, you [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SRzc6YnT3A&t=1149.58s)]
*  know? [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SRzc6YnT3A&t=1157.06s)]
*  Um, I know Dana white had, had obviously helped a ton and made it happen, but, [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SRzc6YnT3A&t=1157.82s)]
*  um, that he'd asked his son, is this a guy's, uh, podcast that I should do? [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SRzc6YnT3A&t=1163.86s)]
*  So I thought that was kind of neat just to know that he like, you know, checks [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SRzc6YnT3A&t=1168.58s)]
*  in with his son Baron or whatever about, um, about different stuff, you know? [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SRzc6YnT3A&t=1172.22s)]
*  Uh, so that was, that was, yeah, it was cool. [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SRzc6YnT3A&t=1177.66s)]
*  It just went so fast. [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SRzc6YnT3A&t=1182.18s)]
*  I only had a kind of a limited amount of time and it went so fast. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SRzc6YnT3A&t=1183.18s)]
*  And the next thing you know, we had to wrap it up and I was like, I couldn't, I [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SRzc6YnT3A&t=1187.26s)]
*  wanted to ask like one more good question, but I didn't know what to ask. [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SRzc6YnT3A&t=1192.14s)]
*  Um, and I know that, um, sorry, I'm saying, um, a lot guys, I think I'm nervous [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SRzc6YnT3A&t=1196.42s)]
*  even reciting this for some reason. [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SRzc6YnT3A&t=1202.18s)]
*  I think I just feel, um, yeah, I just feel like, uh, a lot. [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SRzc6YnT3A&t=1203.86s)]
*  I think I just feel like a lot of energy or something. [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SRzc6YnT3A&t=1214.34s)]
*  I'm not sure. [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SRzc6YnT3A&t=1217.5s)]
*  Um, I feel kind of activated, I guess that's where I'm at today. [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SRzc6YnT3A&t=1218.86s)]
*  So, Oh, so I had one more question and I wanted to ask him, uh, Michael Jackson [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SRzc6YnT3A&t=1224.58s)]
*  used to live in one of the buildings that he owned. [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SRzc6YnT3A&t=1230.54s)]
*  So I wanted to ask him about that because, you know, we've been trying [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SRzc6YnT3A&t=1234.34s)]
*  to learn about Michael Jackson. [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SRzc6YnT3A&t=1238.06s)]
*  So yeah, that was it. [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SRzc6YnT3A&t=1240.22s)]
*  And then it went pretty quick and then he had to go do something. [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SRzc6YnT3A&t=1243.1s)]
*  There was some, you know, the next thing that he had to go do. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SRzc6YnT3A&t=1246.42s)]
*  And then some of the workers came up, uh, that worked at the golf course and we [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SRzc6YnT3A&t=1249.98s)]
*  walked around and took some photos. [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SRzc6YnT3A&t=1255.6599999999999s)]
*  Um, I got to meet, uh, Ivanka Trump and her husband, Jared, which was pretty cool. [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SRzc6YnT3A&t=1257.62s)]
*  And it's rich there, dude. [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SRzc6YnT3A&t=1264.3s)]
*  They got a nice, they got a pool where all the umbrellas are nice. [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SRzc6YnT3A&t=1265.3799999999999s)]
*  You know what I'm talking about? [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SRzc6YnT3A&t=1272.54s)]
*  The umbrellas are nicer than, um, it's the kind of umbrella where they [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SRzc6YnT3A&t=1273.58s)]
*  take it away when the rain comes. [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SRzc6YnT3A&t=1278.3799999999999s)]
*  You ever been at somebody's place like that? [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SRzc6YnT3A&t=1281.94s)]
*  Like when it rains, they put the umbrellas away cause they don't want them to get [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SRzc6YnT3A&t=1283.7s)]
*  messed up and it's like, well, that's its job. [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SRzc6YnT3A&t=1287.74s)]
*  So they had nice umbrellas. [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SRzc6YnT3A&t=1291.3000000000002s)]
*  They were like probably 200 thread counter 700. [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SRzc6YnT3A&t=1292.98s)]
*  And, um, yeah. [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SRzc6YnT3A&t=1296.38s)]
*  And the umbrellas, I think had a special pattern on them or something. [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SRzc6YnT3A&t=1301.46s)]
*  This was what somebody was telling me. [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SRzc6YnT3A&t=1303.9s)]
*  One of the security guys was telling me there's a special pattern on the [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SRzc6YnT3A&t=1305.22s)]
*  umbrellas where birds will not defecate on that, on that umbrella. [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SRzc6YnT3A&t=1307.94s)]
*  If they're passing by because it's like an optical illusion or something. [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SRzc6YnT3A&t=1312.6599999999999s)]
*  So I thought that that was pretty cool, man. [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SRzc6YnT3A&t=1316.74s)]
*  When you got enough money or enough nice stuff where you're, you know, the [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SRzc6YnT3A&t=1318.34s)]
*  birds aren't even shitting on you. [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SRzc6YnT3A&t=1322.3799999999999s)]
*  You're like, damn, that's nice. [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SRzc6YnT3A&t=1325.02s)]
*  You know, and that's crazy to know that just cause if you're poor, [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SRzc6YnT3A&t=1327.9399999999998s)]
*  the bird shit on you. [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SRzc6YnT3A&t=1331.8999999999999s)]
*  So that was like, that kind of blew my mind. [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SRzc6YnT3A&t=1333.98s)]
*  I was like, damn, I want to make enough money one day where the bird, the [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SRzc6YnT3A&t=1336.58s)]
*  where, where, you know, I'm free of these, you know, these chains of bird [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SRzc6YnT3A&t=1341.46s)]
*  shit or whatever that bind us. [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SRzc6YnT3A&t=1346.74s)]
*  Um, what else was interesting about it? [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SRzc6YnT3A&t=1348.74s)]
*  I'm not trying to brag about it. [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SRzc6YnT3A&t=1353.18s)]
*  I just think that some people would think that it's interesting. [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SRzc6YnT3A&t=1354.3s)]
*  You know, I wanted to talk with him. [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SRzc6YnT3A&t=1357.5s)]
*  I wanted to learn more about just his family a little bit. [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SRzc6YnT3A&t=1358.78s)]
*  If I could. [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SRzc6YnT3A&t=1362.38s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SRzc6YnT3A&t=1363.66s)]
*  I wanted to ask that Michael Jackson question. [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SRzc6YnT3A&t=1363.82s)]
*  And I forgot. [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SRzc6YnT3A&t=1365.66s)]
*  I wanted to ask if I thought that if he, if he thought that he had a better [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SRzc6YnT3A&t=1367.38s)]
*  chance of running against Biden or, uh, Kamala and yeah, and then I just [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SRzc6YnT3A&t=1371.7s)]
*  wanted to talk to him, you know, I wanted to, you know, I know he had a [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SRzc6YnT3A&t=1379.6200000000001s)]
*  brother that passed away from alcoholism and I wanted to, uh, just to talk about [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SRzc6YnT3A&t=1383.3000000000002s)]
*  that, just to learn about it a little bit and, and see what that was like, [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SRzc6YnT3A&t=1389.74s)]
*  you know, cause I know that a lot of times we talk about that stuff on here. [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SRzc6YnT3A&t=1395.18s)]
*  And if people, if there's a way to talk about it with people, so, but [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SRzc6YnT3A&t=1398.78s)]
*  yeah, I was super nervous. [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SRzc6YnT3A&t=1403.94s)]
*  It even makes me nervous. [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SRzc6YnT3A&t=1404.98s)]
*  I think even thinking about it, uh, I wore like a suit coat or something. [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SRzc6YnT3A&t=1405.94s)]
*  Um, and that made me know, you know, that just makes you fucking nervous. [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SRzc6YnT3A&t=1412.9s)]
*  You, you know, you just feel like a damn stuffed animal when you put those [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SRzc6YnT3A&t=1417.3s)]
*  things on, you feel like just a little teddy bear or something, you know, you [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SRzc6YnT3A&t=1421.3s)]
*  feel like you're disposed to date, you know, like you're just supposed to get [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SRzc6YnT3A&t=1425.02s)]
*  angry at your secretary or something and, uh, and then cheat on your spouse or [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SRzc6YnT3A&t=1428.5s)]
*  whatever, you know, just, you know, you just feel like you just can't handle it. [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SRzc6YnT3A&t=1433.42s)]
*  Kind of shit. [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SRzc6YnT3A&t=1438.22s)]
*  Like those jackets kind of make me feel like that too, but I wanted to, um, be [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SRzc6YnT3A&t=1438.82s)]
*  respectful, you know, it's definitely, it's a respectful environment and I've [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SRzc6YnT3A&t=1443.7s)]
*  never gotten to talk to a president. [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SRzc6YnT3A&t=1451.54s)]
*  I mean, you know, I'd gotten to say, you know, see one kind of in passing and, um, [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SRzc6YnT3A&t=1453.26s)]
*  but it was just fascinating. [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SRzc6YnT3A&t=1458.3400000000001s)]
*  So that was, yeah, that was fascinating, man. [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SRzc6YnT3A&t=1459.7s)]
*  Um, and then, oh, this was one thing that was really cool. [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SRzc6YnT3A&t=1462.46s)]
*  So afterwards there's a restaurant at the, at the golf club in Bedminster. [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SRzc6YnT3A&t=1467.5s)]
*  You know, it's really, I mean, it's beautiful, but the grass all looks [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SRzc6YnT3A&t=1474.14s)]
*  like it actually went to super cuts, you know, not like a, just somebody did it [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SRzc6YnT3A&t=1478.86s)]
*  with a mower, it's like, so, you know, like somebody, you know, it's like the, [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SRzc6YnT3A&t=1483.58s)]
*  the, the lawn looks like it waited in a chair for its appointment with a barber. [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SRzc6YnT3A&t=1490.2199999999998s)]
*  It's just nice. [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SRzc6YnT3A&t=1494.74s)]
*  And, um, oh, and there's secret service. [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SRzc6YnT3A&t=1496.4199999999998s)]
*  This is the craziest part. [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SRzc6YnT3A&t=1499.26s)]
*  So there's people playing golf and then there's just secret little [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SRzc6YnT3A&t=1500.86s)]
*  setups of secret service people with. [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SRzc6YnT3A&t=1504.78s)]
*  Can't, I don't know if they're cannons or whatever, you know, hand [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SRzc6YnT3A&t=1507.5s)]
*  cannons or something, you know, artillery just placed in different spots. [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SRzc6YnT3A&t=1510.74s)]
*  So, yeah, I think you just gotta be careful where you hit, where you [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SRzc6YnT3A&t=1515.46s)]
*  hit your ball over there, but so there's a restaurant, so we go up there and [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SRzc6YnT3A&t=1519.6200000000001s)]
*  I'm sitting and I'm eating dinner. [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SRzc6YnT3A&t=1524.54s)]
*  Uh, before I have to leave, I'm getting some dinner with one of his staff members [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SRzc6YnT3A&t=1526.46s)]
*  and we're sitting at a table. [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SRzc6YnT3A&t=1532.42s)]
*  It's just me and him. [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SRzc6YnT3A&t=1533.5s)]
*  Um, the guy I'd been communicating with his name is Alex. [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SRzc6YnT3A&t=1534.86s)]
*  Nice guy, really creative guy. [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SRzc6YnT3A&t=1537.6599999999999s)]
*  And then Trump comes up for dinner at some point. [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SRzc6YnT3A&t=1540.78s)]
*  I didn't know this and they play the song proud to be an American when he comes up. [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SRzc6YnT3A&t=1542.74s)]
*  Right. [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SRzc6YnT3A&t=1547.34s)]
*  Which is kind of, it's crazy. [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SRzc6YnT3A&t=1547.58s)]
*  You know, it's a vibe and, and, uh, but they play it. [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SRzc6YnT3A&t=1550.5s)]
*  And so the song, so everybody's standing up and kind of clapping and, um, and you [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SRzc6YnT3A&t=1555.8999999999999s)]
*  think the song's over, right? [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SRzc6YnT3A&t=1560.78s)]
*  It's a kind of a long song. [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SRzc6YnT3A&t=1562.1399999999999s)]
*  And then it's like, you think it's like over and then it's like, and I'm proud of [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SRzc6YnT3A&t=1564.1s)]
*  it does it one more time. [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SRzc6YnT3A&t=1569.42s)]
*  You're like, all right, let's go for this ride again. [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SRzc6YnT3A&t=1570.82s)]
*  And then he sits there. [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SRzc6YnT3A&t=1573.78s)]
*  He keeps at his table. [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SRzc6YnT3A&t=1575.58s)]
*  He keeps the iPad with the aux cord or whatever. [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SRzc6YnT3A&t=1576.78s)]
*  And so throughout the meal, he's just playing songs. [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SRzc6YnT3A&t=1579.5s)]
*  You know, he played, what did he play? [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SRzc6YnT3A&t=1583.02s)]
*  He played some poison, I think unskinny bop at one point, I think trying to [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SRzc6YnT3A&t=1586.6599999999999s)]

*  I want to look through a little bit of news here. [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SRzc6YnT3A&t=2028.5s)]
*  Um, what happened? [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SRzc6YnT3A&t=2031.26s)]
*  I see, Oh, Trump brought out RFK jr. [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SRzc6YnT3A&t=2032.8200000000002s)]
*  In Arizona. [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SRzc6YnT3A&t=2035.7s)]
*  Um, you know, we got to have Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump come on. [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SRzc6YnT3A&t=2038.26s)]
*  You know, I loved, uh, Bernie Sanders. [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SRzc6YnT3A&t=2043.18s)]
*  I felt like he got really just screwed over by his party. [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SRzc6YnT3A&t=2046.06s)]
*  I thought that that was really messed up. [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SRzc6YnT3A&t=2049.8199999999997s)]
*  I'd always hoped that they would have had a Trump and Sanders ticket. [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SRzc6YnT3A&t=2051.98s)]
*  I thought that that would have been interesting. [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SRzc6YnT3A&t=2055.22s)]
*  You know, I know people don't like politics and stuff and I'm not, uh, I'm [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SRzc6YnT3A&t=2058.06s)]
*  not, I don't really care who people support. [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SRzc6YnT3A&t=2063.3799999999997s)]
*  You know, I think it's good to vote for sure. [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SRzc6YnT3A&t=2066.5s)]
*  I sometimes wonder what our vote means anymore, but, but that's out [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SRzc6YnT3A&t=2070.1s)]
*  of our control right now. [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SRzc6YnT3A&t=2073.62s)]
*  Um, you just do the best you can and you go vote. [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SRzc6YnT3A&t=2075.74s)]
*  Um, that's what I feel like for me. [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SRzc6YnT3A&t=2078.46s)]
*  You know, I'm not telling anybody to do you do whatever you want. [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SRzc6YnT3A&t=2081.6600000000003s)]
*  Um, but I thought this was interesting though. [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SRzc6YnT3A&t=2084.86s)]
*  Uh, Oh, because I always thought it would be interesting if you had. [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SRzc6YnT3A&t=2089.7400000000002s)]
*  Like whoever didn't win the presidency should be the vice president. [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SRzc6YnT3A&t=2096.02s)]
*  That way you still, you have to have like a, not an enemy, but somebody who has [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SRzc6YnT3A&t=2099.3s)]
*  different views in your same thing so that you guys have to like negotiate and [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SRzc6YnT3A&t=2103.7s)]
*  figure out the best thing for everyone. [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SRzc6YnT3A&t=2108.8199999999997s)]
*  You know, that's something that I always kind of wished, uh, that that's the [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SRzc6YnT3A&t=2112.58s)]
*  way that things were, you know? [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SRzc6YnT3A&t=2116.2599999999998s)]
*  Um, so like if a Republican won, then the Democratic nominee was the vice [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SRzc6YnT3A&t=2118.5s)]
*  president and if the Democratic one, then the Republican nominee was the vice [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SRzc6YnT3A&t=2125.1s)]
*  president, I always thought that that would be interesting because then it [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SRzc6YnT3A&t=2128.3799999999997s)]
*  creates constant constantly where it would seem like you're having to work [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SRzc6YnT3A&t=2131.42s)]
*  together to get, um, a solution on different topics and stuff, but I'm [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SRzc6YnT3A&t=2135.14s)]
*  novice and things like that. [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SRzc6YnT3A&t=2140.78s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SRzc6YnT3A&t=2142.02s)]
*  Um, but yeah, getting to meet with Bernie was amazing as well. [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SRzc6YnT3A&t=2143.02s)]
*  Uh, I'll talk more about that next week. [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SRzc6YnT3A&t=2147.82s)]
*  Um, what else was I thinking? [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SRzc6YnT3A&t=2151.62s)]
*  Oh, but Trump brought out RFK junior, you know, and I love Bobby Kennedy. [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SRzc6YnT3A&t=2153.42s)]
*  You know, he and I've been friends for years. [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SRzc6YnT3A&t=2159.5s)]
*  Uh, he is, people can think whatever, he's an awesome guy. [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SRzc6YnT3A&t=2161.8199999999997s)]
*  You know, he's just a good guy. [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SRzc6YnT3A&t=2167.46s)]
*  He's, he's, I feel like he's just dedicated. [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SRzc6YnT3A&t=2168.5s)]
*  He cares. [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SRzc6YnT3A&t=2170.98s)]
*  He's smart. [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SRzc6YnT3A&t=2171.5s)]
*  Um, and I think he wants wellness for people. [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SRzc6YnT3A&t=2172.58s)]
*  And so that's why I think it was pretty fascinating that, um, that Trump offered [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SRzc6YnT3A&t=2176.46s)]
*  him a spot if, if he gets the election and the Democrats kind of shot themselves in [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SRzc6YnT3A&t=2182.3399999999997s)]
*  the, uh, in the wiener or the trans wiener or whatever people have to have. [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SRzc6YnT3A&t=2186.58s)]
*  And I'm not claiming anybody has anything, but because they should have, [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SRzc6YnT3A&t=2191.86s)]
*  you know, they didn't really make it. [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SRzc6YnT3A&t=2195.8199999999997s)]
*  They made it so hard on Bobby to get on the ballots that he didn't really have a [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SRzc6YnT3A&t=2197.38s)]
*  choice except to, um, kind of join a side with, with the hopes and the promise. [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SRzc6YnT3A&t=2202.22s)]
*  It seems like that he will get to be, um, in charge of, or spearhead the things that [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SRzc6YnT3A&t=2211.02s)]
*  he cares about most, which are people's health, uh, and, um, getting like big [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SRzc6YnT3A&t=2218.86s)]
*  pharma out of, out of our bodies, you know, and out of our influence and everything, [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SRzc6YnT3A&t=2225.18s)]
*  I guess, I don't know, I'm rambling. [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SRzc6YnT3A&t=2231.9s)]
*  I'm going to get off politics now because, uh, people have different thoughts about it. [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SRzc6YnT3A&t=2233.3s)]
*  But anyway, I just thought that that, that, that was interesting. [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SRzc6YnT3A&t=2237.1s)]
*  It's funny because it seems like Trump is just being different. [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SRzc6YnT3A&t=2240.06s)]
*  You know, even when you saw, like when he brought out Bobby Kennedy, he, like, it [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SRzc6YnT3A&t=2244.78s)]
*  was just more, it's felt more thoughtful than he had like spoken in the past. [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SRzc6YnT3A&t=2248.54s)]
*  Um, you know, I don't know, just seemed kind of interesting, but that, but I [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SRzc6YnT3A&t=2254.66s)]
*  thought that that was that that's super that, that Bobby has a chance to get a job, [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SRzc6YnT3A&t=2260.94s)]
*  uh, or not a job, but, uh, cause he doesn't need a job, but, but that he has a chance [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SRzc6YnT3A&t=2265.78s)]
*  to get like, to do what he really cares about. [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SRzc6YnT3A&t=2271.5s)]
*  I thought that that was pretty super. [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SRzc6YnT3A&t=2275.42s)]
*  So, um, and then people, you know, you know, people say, Oh, well Trump, you [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SRzc6YnT3A&t=2276.7000000000003s)]
*  know, people often refer to Trump as like a shady businessman, but it's funny [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SRzc6YnT3A&t=2288.14s)]
*  because politics now it's not like who's the best person or anything anymore. [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SRzc6YnT3A&t=2294.34s)]
*  Really politics. [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SRzc6YnT3A&t=2298.38s)]
*  The whole thing is a shady business. [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SRzc6YnT3A&t=2300.5s)]
*  It's a dirty fucking business that's compromised at every corner. [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SRzc6YnT3A&t=2303.86s)]
*  It's not about who's the best. [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SRzc6YnT3A&t=2309.6600000000003s)]
*  It's, it's, it's about the, it's so you need a dog in there. [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SRzc6YnT3A&t=2311.26s)]
*  I think that's one thing I'm realizing. [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SRzc6YnT3A&t=2316.2200000000003s)]
*  You need a dog in there. [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SRzc6YnT3A&t=2318.86s)]
*  Cause yeah, politics is just a dirty business. [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SRzc6YnT3A&t=2321.58s)]
*  So yeah, you don't, you don't, you don't hire a peacekeeper to do a thugs job. [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SRzc6YnT3A&t=2323.54s)]
*  I know that. [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SRzc6YnT3A&t=2328.46s)]
*  Uh, so anyway, what else happened? [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SRzc6YnT3A&t=2329.5s)]
*  There's a U S pilot. [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SRzc6YnT3A&t=2333.7s)]
*  It says here who took magic mushrooms and tried to cut the engines while they were [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SRzc6YnT3A&t=2334.86s)]
*  in, in midair, I guess. [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SRzc6YnT3A&t=2339.46s)]
*  Oh, this is pretty interesting. [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SRzc6YnT3A&t=2341.02s)]
*  Um, an Alaskan airlines pilot who attempted to shut off the engines of a passenger [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SRzc6YnT3A&t=2344.7799999999997s)]
*  plane mid flight after ingesting magic mushrooms said his actions were unfathomable. [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SRzc6YnT3A&t=2348.82s)]
*  And some of his first public remarks after he was indicted on 83 counts of [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SRzc6YnT3A&t=2354.6600000000003s)]
*  reckless endangerment. [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SRzc6YnT3A&t=2358.0600000000004s)]
*  Wow. [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SRzc6YnT3A&t=2359.1000000000004s)]
*  Unless he was listening to that song. [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SRzc6YnT3A&t=2360.82s)]
*  I just want to fly by sugar ray. [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SRzc6YnT3A&t=2362.46s)]
*  If he played that while he did it, that's kind of a vibe. [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SRzc6YnT3A&t=2366.0600000000004s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SRzc6YnT3A&t=2368.6200000000003s)]
*  I've never been a pilot on drugs. [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SRzc6YnT3A&t=2369.82s)]
*  What else? [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SRzc6YnT3A&t=2374.5400000000004s)]
*  The Taliban says it wants people to visit Afghanistan. [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SRzc6YnT3A&t=2374.86s)]

*  A long time fan, first time caller. [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SRzc6YnT3A&t=2988.86s)]
*  And I just had a thought yesterday. [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SRzc6YnT3A&t=2991.66s)]
*  I was, you know, I was on the lake. [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SRzc6YnT3A&t=2993.7799999999997s)]
*  I was surfing, having a good old time and we're, we're driving by and I see this [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SRzc6YnT3A&t=2995.54s)]
*  woman on this pontoon boat and I, I'm telling you, she may be weighed a buck 50, [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SRzc6YnT3A&t=3000.22s)]
*  but those breasts probably took up 125 pounds of it. [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SRzc6YnT3A&t=3005.86s)]
*  And, and I looked at her and I didn't even get aroused per se. [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SRzc6YnT3A&t=3010.14s)]
*  I just thought I was like, man, you need to get on my credit score. [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SRzc6YnT3A&t=3013.98s)]
*  You know, you ever seen a woman that's so beautiful, a rack so nice, whether it [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SRzc6YnT3A&t=3017.9s)]

*  Let's take another call here. [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SRzc6YnT3A&t=3136.42s)]
*  Hey Theo. [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SRzc6YnT3A&t=3139.98s)]
*  This is John from Kansas city. [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SRzc6YnT3A&t=3140.98s)]
*  Hey John, thank you for calling Kansas city. [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SRzc6YnT3A&t=3143.42s)]
*  We got a show coming up there, I believe. [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SRzc6YnT3A&t=3146.5400000000004s)]
*  And, and I'm excited about that, but let's hear more brother onward. [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SRzc6YnT3A&t=3148.1400000000003s)]
*  And I got a question for you. [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SRzc6YnT3A&t=3153.5800000000004s)]
*  So my dad is currently, you know, doing that. [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SRzc6YnT3A&t=3155.82s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SRzc6YnT3A&t=3160.14s)]
*  That powder and he's been doing it for a while now. [[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SRzc6YnT3A&t=3161.3399999999997s)]
*  I just, he'll get these episodes where he's just angry and I [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SRzc6YnT3A&t=3164.8199999999997s)]
*  don't know what to do about it. [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SRzc6YnT3A&t=3169.54s)]
*  So I've always, I want to try to figure out how to help him get back to normal, [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SRzc6YnT3A&t=3172.9s)]
*  get back to being the dad that I remember because it's scary. [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SRzc6YnT3A&t=3177.2599999999998s)]
*  But anyways, I just wanted to see your thoughts about it. [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SRzc6YnT3A&t=3182.2999999999997s)]
*  See if you can maybe, you know, give me some insights on what I should do. [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SRzc6YnT3A&t=3184.7s)]
*  Gang man. [[00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SRzc6YnT3A&t=3191.62s)]
*  Um, thanks for calling dude. [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SRzc6YnT3A&t=3192.58s)]
*  Uh, yeah, I'm sorry that your dad's going through that. [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SRzc6YnT3A&t=3194.98s)]
*  You know, I don't know if he's an addict or if it's just something [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SRzc6YnT3A&t=3199.9399999999996s)]
*  that he's doing for fun, but obviously it's affecting you. [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SRzc6YnT3A&t=3203.5s)]
*  I think, yeah, I mean, maybe just try to sit and talk with them and say, [[00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SRzc6YnT3A&t=3207.2599999999998s)]
*  Hey dad, I feel like, you know, don't accuse him, but say, Hey, you know, [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SRzc6YnT3A&t=3212.34s)]
*  maybe I feel like this is something that's going on. [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SRzc6YnT3A&t=3216.26s)]
*  You know, do you feel like that's something you want to be doing or do [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SRzc6YnT3A&t=3219.6600000000003s)]
*  you feel like it's a problem? [[00:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SRzc6YnT3A&t=3223.54s)]
*  You know, I don't know. [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SRzc6YnT3A&t=3226.6200000000003s)]
*  Um, you know, the only things, the only way that I had, have had success [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SRzc6YnT3A&t=3228.02s)]
*  is through a 12 step recovery. [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SRzc6YnT3A&t=3234.42s)]
*  That's the only way I've had success. [[00:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SRzc6YnT3A&t=3237.3s)]
*  And, you know, I've had some relapses, but that's the main way that I've, [[00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SRzc6YnT3A&t=3239.62s)]
*  uh, found sobriety in my life. [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SRzc6YnT3A&t=3245.22s)]
*  And, you know, they have NA narcotics anonymous for drug use, and there's [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SRzc6YnT3A&t=3248.46s)]
*  probably even a CA for cocaine use. [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SRzc6YnT3A&t=3255.82s)]
*  There is. [[00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SRzc6YnT3A&t=3257.46s)]
*  So I don't know, maybe you could offer to go to a meeting with him. [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SRzc6YnT3A&t=3258.62s)]
*  Um, maybe you could go to a meeting and ask some people there if they had any [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SRzc6YnT3A&t=3264.18s)]
*  suggestions, um, but yeah, just letting, letting him know that you care, you know? [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SRzc6YnT3A&t=3269.3799999999997s)]
*  Uh, and then, you know, you could even ask him if he doesn't want to talk about it. [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SRzc6YnT3A&t=3278.8999999999996s)]
*  You could ask him, Hey, is it okay to ask you about it again? [[00:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SRzc6YnT3A&t=3284.4599999999996s)]
*  You know, in a few weeks or something, is it okay if I check back in with you about [[00:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SRzc6YnT3A&t=3287.8599999999997s)]
*  this? [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SRzc6YnT3A&t=3291.22s)]
*  Because even then you're opening on a little bit, if he, if he's willing to say, [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SRzc6YnT3A&t=3293.02s)]
*  yes, you're opening a little bit of a door, you know, cause people have to be [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SRzc6YnT3A&t=3296.18s)]
*  willing to get help for themselves, I think. [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SRzc6YnT3A&t=3300.9399999999996s)]
*  And I'm not preaching. [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SRzc6YnT3A&t=3304.7s)]
*  This is just, um, some of my own experience and things that I've seen. [[00:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SRzc6YnT3A&t=3305.54s)]
*  Um, we have to be willing to get help for ourselves, but sometimes I'll notice. [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SRzc6YnT3A&t=3312.2599999999998s)]
*  Like if, like if, like I have a friend that's used that trick on me before, and [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SRzc6YnT3A&t=3318.3s)]
*  it's a trick really, but it's not really, you know, you know, he asked me about [[00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SRzc6YnT3A&t=3325.06s)]
*  something, if I was having a problem with some, he's like, do you want to talk [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SRzc6YnT3A&t=3329.7s)]
*  about it? [[00:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SRzc6YnT3A&t=3332.42s)]
*  I'd be like, I don't want to, you know, I don't want to talk about it. [[00:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SRzc6YnT3A&t=3332.62s)]
*  But then he'd be like, Hey, is it okay if I talk to you about it? [[00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SRzc6YnT3A&t=3334.3s)]
*  If I ask you about it again, sometime, can I check back in with you about it [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SRzc6YnT3A&t=3336.1s)]
*  again in a few weeks? [[00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SRzc6YnT3A&t=3339.42s)]
*  I want to make sure you're okay. [[00:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SRzc6YnT3A&t=3341.1s)]
*  And by saying, and I would agree to that. [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SRzc6YnT3A&t=3342.98s)]
*  And by agreeing to that, it's slowly making me a little bit willing to hear [[00:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SRzc6YnT3A&t=3344.7799999999997s)]
*  something different, right? [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SRzc6YnT3A&t=3350.74s)]
*  Cause that's all your, that's all you're that an addict needs is willingness. [[00:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SRzc6YnT3A&t=3353.74s)]
*  They just have to get a little willing and then willingness will grow. [[00:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SRzc6YnT3A&t=3359.1s)]
*  Right? [[00:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SRzc6YnT3A&t=3362.7s)]
*  So sometimes that's a way you, that you can maybe, you know, I'm not trying to [[00:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SRzc6YnT3A&t=3363.5s)]
*  trick your dad, but it's also a way where you can create a, a, a, a, a [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SRzc6YnT3A&t=3368.4199999999996s)]
*  way, Hey, I'm going to check back in about this. [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SRzc6YnT3A&t=3374.46s)]
*  And then when you do check back out in with an addict, it reminds them, Oh, [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SRzc6YnT3A&t=3377.2200000000003s)]
*  this person cares. [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SRzc6YnT3A&t=3380.5s)]
*  And, um, and connection is the, is the, is really the, is one of the biggest [[00:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SRzc6YnT3A&t=3381.94s)]
*  remedies for addiction is connection. [[00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SRzc6YnT3A&t=3392.14s)]
*  Um, so anyway, I'm not sure if some of that makes sense, but you want to get a [[00:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SRzc6YnT3A&t=3395.9s)]
*  little bit of willingness out of somebody. [[00:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SRzc6YnT3A&t=3400.42s)]
*  So sometimes if you get a no, it's like, Hey, can I check back in with you about [[00:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SRzc6YnT3A&t=3403.0600000000004s)]
*  it? [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SRzc6YnT3A&t=3406.26s)]
*  Um, but I'm sorry, you're going through that man and I'm happy that you care [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SRzc6YnT3A&t=3406.94s)]
*  about your dad and, and I bet he's not happy about it, you know, and he probably [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SRzc6YnT3A&t=3410.94s)]
*  doesn't know where to start. [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SRzc6YnT3A&t=3419.3s)]
*  Um, but yeah, it's, you know, people have to want to help themselves, but sometimes [[00:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SRzc6YnT3A&t=3421.1000000000004s)]
*  we can, um, we can help plan a little bit of seat of willingness by creating [[00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SRzc6YnT3A&t=3429.34s)]
*  some patience and a chance for a little bit of mild accountability in the sense [[00:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SRzc6YnT3A&t=3436.3s)]
*  like, Hey, can I check back in with you? [[00:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SRzc6YnT3A&t=3442.1000000000004s)]
*  So anyway, man, I love you brother and, uh, hang in there and, um, we'll holler [[00:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SRzc6YnT3A&t=3444.2200000000003s)]
*  man, I'm going to, I'm coming to Kansas city and if you want to bring your dad [[00:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SRzc6YnT3A&t=3451.78s)]
*  out to a show, I'm happy to get you guys some tickets. [[00:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SRzc6YnT3A&t=3454.86s)]
