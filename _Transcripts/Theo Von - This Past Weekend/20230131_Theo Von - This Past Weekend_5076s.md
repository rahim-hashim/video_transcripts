*  Five nine. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to24WDozHJg&t=349.0s)]
*  That's kind of small, bro. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to24WDozHJg&t=350.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to24WDozHJg&t=352.0s)]
*  He's a smaller guy. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to24WDozHJg&t=353.0s)]
*  Damn. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to24WDozHJg&t=354.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to24WDozHJg&t=355.0s)]
*  Because he started looking Asian at the end. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to24WDozHJg&t=356.0s)]
*  He switched up. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to24WDozHJg&t=359.0s)]
*  He made a big switch up. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to24WDozHJg&t=360.0s)]
*  He went through all, he went every, he didn't fucking miss a gender. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to24WDozHJg&t=361.0s)]
*  He didn't miss ethnicity. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to24WDozHJg&t=364.0s)]
*  He hit Mexican. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to24WDozHJg&t=366.0s)]
*  He hit them all, man. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to24WDozHJg&t=367.0s)]
*  He hit them all for real. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to24WDozHJg&t=369.0s)]
*  Then he went past white. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to24WDozHJg&t=371.0s)]
*  Like the white he went was like, pass what the fuck white is. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to24WDozHJg&t=372.0s)]
*  We're like, oh, he's the one that did slavery, bro. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to24WDozHJg&t=376.0s)]
*  We were all pointing at him. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to24WDozHJg&t=379.0s)]
*  We're like, that motherfucker did it, bro. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to24WDozHJg&t=381.0s)]
*  We were pointing at him, dude. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to24WDozHJg&t=383.0s)]
*  He looked like Jackie O at the end, bro. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to24WDozHJg&t=385.0s)]
*  Pull up Jackie O, man. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to24WDozHJg&t=388.0s)]
*  Dang, cuz he went all the way, right? [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to24WDozHJg&t=390.0s)]
*  Dang, bro. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to24WDozHJg&t=393.0s)]
*  You know, his dad was beating the shit out of them, though. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to24WDozHJg&t=394.0s)]
*  Oh, he was beating the shit out of them. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to24WDozHJg&t=396.0s)]
*  That's probably why his dad looked like that now. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to24WDozHJg&t=397.0s)]
*  Like a damn ball sack. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to24WDozHJg&t=399.0s)]
*  But a lot of black guys can sing anyway. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to24WDozHJg&t=400.0s)]
*  It's like, why would you even beat your kid in the singing? [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to24WDozHJg&t=402.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to24WDozHJg&t=405.0s)]
*  But he was talented. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to24WDozHJg&t=406.0s)]
*  I think he just wanted them to be perfect, though. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to24WDozHJg&t=407.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to24WDozHJg&t=409.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to24WDozHJg&t=410.0s)]
*  Damn, bro. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to24WDozHJg&t=411.0s)]
*  Sometimes you get excellence out of that, though. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to24WDozHJg&t=412.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to24WDozHJg&t=414.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to24WDozHJg&t=415.0s)]
*  Yeah, I wonder if you could beat somebody into excellence. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to24WDozHJg&t=416.0s)]
*  Maybe that's an example of it, huh? [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to24WDozHJg&t=418.0s)]
*  That's an example, but you know, they lose their mind after it. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to24WDozHJg&t=420.0s)]
*  So it's a bad trail, just this downhill trail, man. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to24WDozHJg&t=423.0s)]
*  It's sad. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to24WDozHJg&t=427.0s)]
*  I'm friends with his daughter. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to24WDozHJg&t=428.0s)]
*  She's awesome. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to24WDozHJg&t=429.0s)]
*  Janet Jackson? [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to24WDozHJg&t=431.0s)]
*  No, Paris Jackson. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to24WDozHJg&t=432.0s)]
*  Who the fuck is that? [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to24WDozHJg&t=433.0s)]
*  Oh, Michael Jackson's daughter. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to24WDozHJg&t=435.0s)]
*  Daughter, yeah. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to24WDozHJg&t=436.0s)]
*  Are you real? [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to24WDozHJg&t=437.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to24WDozHJg&t=438.0s)]
*  She's sweetheart. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to24WDozHJg&t=439.0s)]
*  Wow. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to24WDozHJg&t=440.0s)]
*  Where's Blanket? [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to24WDozHJg&t=441.0s)]
*  Can we? [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to24WDozHJg&t=442.0s)]
*  Where is Blanket? [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to24WDozHJg&t=443.0s)]
*  Pull up Blanket, baby. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to24WDozHJg&t=444.0s)]
*  Pull up Blanket, baby. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to24WDozHJg&t=445.0s)]
*  No, Blanket disappeared, right? [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to24WDozHJg&t=446.0s)]
*  Oh, I don't know. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to24WDozHJg&t=447.0s)]
*  I think he changed his name and everything. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to24WDozHJg&t=448.0s)]
*  Uh-huh, really? [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to24WDozHJg&t=450.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to24WDozHJg&t=451.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to24WDozHJg&t=452.0s)]
*  Yeah, I don't think Blanket Jackson is... [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to24WDozHJg&t=453.0s)]
*  Fucking throw rug or something. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to24WDozHJg&t=455.0s)]
*  Damn. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to24WDozHJg&t=457.0s)]
*  You look different. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to24WDozHJg&t=458.0s)]
*  Blanket is like a... [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to24WDozHJg&t=459.0s)]
*  Because a lot of brothers used to have crazy names back in the day. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to24WDozHJg&t=460.0s)]
*  Blanket, Whisker. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to24WDozHJg&t=463.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to24WDozHJg&t=464.0s)]
*  You'd meet a brother named Whisker. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to24WDozHJg&t=465.0s)]
*  I think he changed his name, didn't he? [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to24WDozHJg&t=466.0s)]
*  Damn, he kind of had that Native American look. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to24WDozHJg&t=468.0s)]
*  Uh-huh. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to24WDozHJg&t=470.0s)]
*  Wow. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to24WDozHJg&t=471.0s)]
*  Did Michael Jackson use his own nut to make his kids? [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to24WDozHJg&t=472.0s)]
*  Ooh. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to24WDozHJg&t=475.0s)]
*  Couldn't have. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to24WDozHJg&t=476.0s)]
*  You mean into a woman? [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to24WDozHJg&t=477.0s)]
*  He look Indian. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to24WDozHJg&t=479.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to24WDozHJg&t=480.0s)]
*  There's no way. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to24WDozHJg&t=481.0s)]
*  There ain't no black gene in that. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to24WDozHJg&t=482.0s)]
*  He look like Full Moonwalk. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to24WDozHJg&t=483.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to24WDozHJg&t=485.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to24WDozHJg&t=486.0s)]
*  That's... [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to24WDozHJg&t=487.0s)]
*  Yeah, there's no black gene in that blood right there. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to24WDozHJg&t=488.0s)]
*  I think so, yeah. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to24WDozHJg&t=491.0s)]
*  But that's a good question, right? [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to24WDozHJg&t=492.0s)]
*  I think even the parents, Jackson, how does she look? [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to24WDozHJg&t=493.0s)]
*  She's completely white, right? [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to24WDozHJg&t=495.0s)]
*  She has more of a white look. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to24WDozHJg&t=496.0s)]
*  She has a little bit, I think she gets... [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to24WDozHJg&t=498.0s)]
*  You can see a little bit of, um... [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to24WDozHJg&t=500.0s)]
*  Like... [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to24WDozHJg&t=503.0s)]
*  There you go. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to24WDozHJg&t=505.0s)]
*  Yeah, ain't no black in that blood. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to24WDozHJg&t=506.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to24WDozHJg&t=508.0s)]
*  She got a little bit urban in the eyes, I think. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to24WDozHJg&t=509.0s)]
*  In the eyes? [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to24WDozHJg&t=511.0s)]
*  I think so. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to24WDozHJg&t=512.0s)]
*  They're fucking blue. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to24WDozHJg&t=513.0s)]
*  Yeah, but they fucking want to be black. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to24WDozHJg&t=514.0s)]
*  How do they want to be black? [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to24WDozHJg&t=517.0s)]
*  You can see looking at them, bitch, zoom in, Zach. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to24WDozHJg&t=520.0s)]
*  Dang. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to24WDozHJg&t=522.0s)]
*  Come on, man. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to24WDozHJg&t=523.0s)]

*  We guessing? [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to24WDozHJg&t=525.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to24WDozHJg&t=526.0s)]
*  Yeah, nah, I don't see any black there, man, other than the pupils. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to24WDozHJg&t=527.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's a little. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to24WDozHJg&t=530.0s)]
*  That's about it. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to24WDozHJg&t=531.0s)]
*  Yeah, nah, he didn't make that with his nut. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to24WDozHJg&t=532.0s)]
*  He didn't make that with his nut, man, I'm telling you. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to24WDozHJg&t=534.0s)]
*  I don't know, that's funny, yeah, because I guess if you are not... [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to24WDozHJg&t=537.0s)]
*  Because I don't know if he was attracted to... [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to24WDozHJg&t=540.0s)]
*  I guess he was attracted to women, huh? [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to24WDozHJg&t=542.0s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to24WDozHJg&t=543.0s)]

*  Yeah, dude. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to24WDozHJg&t=548.0s)]
*  He probably did a lot of secretive stuff. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to24WDozHJg&t=549.0s)]
*  Druske, thanks for coming, bro. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to24WDozHJg&t=550.0s)]
*  Thank you, brother. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to24WDozHJg&t=551.0s)]

*  I've seen some clips but what is it like and is that hard on you when you go out there? [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to24WDozHJg&t=712.78s)]
*  Yeah, I think it's a lot of pressure. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to24WDozHJg&t=717.14s)]
*  A lot of people want to know if I'm going to do stand up. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to24WDozHJg&t=718.14s)]
*  A lot of people, you know, the OGs I've talked to want to know if I'm going to do stand up. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to24WDozHJg&t=720.14s)]
*  Just giving the fans what they want, man. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to24WDozHJg&t=724.06s)]
*  When they come on this tour, they're going to see. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to24WDozHJg&t=726.18s)]
*  I haven't given out too much of what I'm going to do on this tour. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to24WDozHJg&t=728.18s)]
*  Yeah, that's why even when we- [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to24WDozHJg&t=730.18s)]
*  It's going to be very interesting. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to24WDozHJg&t=731.18s)]
*  When we spoke about it, it was kind of- [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to24WDozHJg&t=732.18s)]
*  It's a comedy show, though. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to24WDozHJg&t=734.18s)]
*  It's not like bullshit. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to24WDozHJg&t=735.18s)]
*  Right. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to24WDozHJg&t=736.18s)]
*  And so who else is on the tour with you? [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to24WDozHJg&t=737.18s)]
*  I know you all got a huge name to it. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to24WDozHJg&t=738.66s)]
*  Yeah, no, no, no. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to24WDozHJg&t=740.14s)]
*  We didn't put too many big names. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to24WDozHJg&t=741.14s)]
*  It's just me. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to24WDozHJg&t=742.5s)]
*  We have an opener, but it's undecided right now. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to24WDozHJg&t=743.78s)]
*  So we're in the process of seeing. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to24WDozHJg&t=746.18s)]
*  It's definitely a comedian that will do stand up as an opener, but we're seeing right now. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to24WDozHJg&t=748.22s)]
*  It's just going to be a great show, man. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to24WDozHJg&t=753.02s)]
*  And I'm super excited. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to24WDozHJg&t=756.98s)]
*  I have all the emotions. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to24WDozHJg&t=757.98s)]
*  I'm excited, nervous, fucking going through it every night in my head, thinking about [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to24WDozHJg&t=759.5799999999999s)]
*  what this shit looks like. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to24WDozHJg&t=766.74s)]
*  You know, this is my first tour by myself. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to24WDozHJg&t=768.06s)]
*  Other tours I've gone on, I've opened up for other people. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to24WDozHJg&t=770.6999999999999s)]
*  Oh, maybe that's what I was looking at. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to24WDozHJg&t=773.26s)]
*  I knew you were doing your own, but I think I saw something you were working with, you [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to24WDozHJg&t=774.58s)]
*  were doing with, I don't know if it was musicians, right? [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to24WDozHJg&t=777.58s)]
*  Was there one you were doing? [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to24WDozHJg&t=779.86s)]
*  I opened up on J. Cole and Chris Brown's tour before. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to24WDozHJg&t=781.02s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to24WDozHJg&t=786.38s)]
*  So did that feel kind of hard? [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to24WDozHJg&t=787.38s)]
*  Because you walk, I mean, you're walking out there, there's 20,000 people out there, you [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to24WDozHJg&t=788.38s)]
*  know, whatever. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to24WDozHJg&t=791.4200000000001s)]
*  But you know, a lot of, I was surprised. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to24WDozHJg&t=792.4200000000001s)]
*  A lot of the people love me. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to24WDozHJg&t=793.4200000000001s)]
*  Like they, I was going out there like no material, just, you know, fucking with the crowd and [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to24WDozHJg&t=794.78s)]
*  going out there, just improv, fucking with the crowd. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to24WDozHJg&t=800.9s)]
*  I think it was, it was a great experience. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to24WDozHJg&t=803.1800000000001s)]
*  But yeah, now it's time for me to show my talent off to my fans, because I've been doing [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to24WDozHJg&t=804.78s)]
*  this for like six years and I haven't done anything for my fans. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to24WDozHJg&t=809.14s)]
*  I've done some meet and greets and stuff, but nothing to entertain my own fans that I [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to24WDozHJg&t=813.26s)]
*  built up to this point, you know? [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to24WDozHJg&t=817.42s)]
*  So, yeah. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to24WDozHJg&t=818.86s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to24WDozHJg&t=820.0600000000001s)]
*  Dang. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to24WDozHJg&t=821.0600000000001s)]
*  Same with you, man. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to24WDozHJg&t=821.86s)]
*  You know, we went on the trip to Louisiana. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to24WDozHJg&t=822.74s)]
*  You were telling me about how you only like to do, you know, small shows. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to24WDozHJg&t=825.14s)]
*  And if you were able to do big shows that you probably wouldn't even do it. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to24WDozHJg&t=828.54s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to24WDozHJg&t=831.74s)]
*  And I don't know why you said that. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to24WDozHJg&t=832.1s)]
*  That kind of threw me off. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to24WDozHJg&t=833.34s)]
*  What was the reason, man? [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to24WDozHJg&t=834.42s)]
*  Because I like to know that the guy, like I like to almost be able to see the guy in [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to24WDozHJg&t=835.62s)]
*  the back of the room so I can get an idea if he's having a good time or not. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to24WDozHJg&t=839.78s)]
*  I feel like if you get above like three, like three thousand in a place, you can't [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to24WDozHJg&t=843.46s)]
*  really tell if that guy in the back. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to24WDozHJg&t=848.46s)]
*  Like, so I would rather do like four, if I could sell like in Baton Rouge, we sold [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to24WDozHJg&t=851.66s)]
*  a, I mean, I think we sold like eight thousand tickets. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to24WDozHJg&t=855.94s)]
*  So you'll do it. You just don't enjoy the big, big, big ones. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to24WDozHJg&t=858.26s)]
*  Right. Because it feels like, I don't know, for some reason, I think I feel like a [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to24WDozHJg&t=862.18s)]

*  I think I definitely feel more open to it. [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to24WDozHJg&t=2001.86s)]
*  When I was young, I think black girls were a lot more intimidating because they seemed [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to24WDozHJg&t=2005.26s)]
*  a lot more like confident and... [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to24WDozHJg&t=2009.26s)]

*  It always feels like it's fourth down. [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to24WDozHJg&t=2223.26s)]
*  I get nervous. [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to24WDozHJg&t=2225.26s)]

*  That's it. [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to24WDozHJg&t=2239.26s)]
*  So it's not long. [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to24WDozHJg&t=2241.26s)]
*  You just go... [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to24WDozHJg&t=2242.26s)]
*  You don't have a long duration of time when you start, man. [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to24WDozHJg&t=2243.26s)]
*  It just happens. [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to24WDozHJg&t=2246.26s)]
*  You're already in fourth quarter when it starts. [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to24WDozHJg&t=2247.26s)]
*  We got one play, dog. [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to24WDozHJg&t=2249.26s)]

*  So I got to... [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to24WDozHJg&t=2254.26s)]
*  I think I got to try a little bit better. [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to24WDozHJg&t=2255.26s)]
*  So that's definitely one thing that's intimidating about black guys is there's definitely a thing [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to24WDozHJg&t=2257.26s)]
*  that it seemed like they have... [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to24WDozHJg&t=2262.26s)]
*  They're going to be better at sex. [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to24WDozHJg&t=2264.26s)]
*  So then you got to feel like, what can I do now? [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to24WDozHJg&t=2266.26s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to24WDozHJg&t=2269.26s)]

*  You know, that just come with it, man. [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to24WDozHJg&t=2272.26s)]
*  But that's probably got to be a lot of pressure, though. [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to24WDozHJg&t=2274.26s)]
*  Are there black guys that are not good at sex? [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to24WDozHJg&t=2277.26s)]
*  It's got to be, bro. [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to24WDozHJg&t=2279.26s)]
*  There's girls out there that talk about dudes that got fucking huge cocks that can't do shit with it. [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to24WDozHJg&t=2281.26s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to24WDozHJg&t=2286.26s)]
*  They're just fucking loading it up in there. [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to24WDozHJg&t=2287.26s)]
*  Just like just feeding it in there. [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to24WDozHJg&t=2289.26s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to24WDozHJg&t=2291.26s)]
*  And they're hurting them, you know. [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to24WDozHJg&t=2292.26s)]
*  So it depends on how you use it. [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to24WDozHJg&t=2293.26s)]
*  That's why I'm a big motion in the ocean guy. [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to24WDozHJg&t=2295.26s)]
*  Yeah, I'm big on that. [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to24WDozHJg&t=2297.26s)]
