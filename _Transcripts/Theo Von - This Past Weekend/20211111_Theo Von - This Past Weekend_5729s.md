*  And he is a, he's a world-class gold medalist in scooter games and in BMX, bicycling. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=13.08s)]
*  This man has done things and you and I could never fathom doing. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=25.740000000000002s)]
*  In our dreams, we can't do the things that this man does in actuality. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=29.62s)]
*  He's a member of the Nitro Circus. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=35.14s)]
*  He's won countless gold medals. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=37.3s)]
*  He's from Australia and we are so happy to have him here today. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=39.160000000000004s)]
*  Mr. Ryan Williams. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=44.260000000000005s)]
*  All right, mate. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=59.62s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=83.92s)]

*  Yeah. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=87.92s)]
*  I'm sitting here with Ryan Williams, who was a real cyclist, I guess, is a, you know, a [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=89.08s)]
*  real astronaut, cyclist, almost ex-gamer. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=97.62s)]
*  What's kind of the appropriate term for somebody like you? [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=102.46000000000001s)]
*  I guess you would say professional BMX rider and a professional scooter rider. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=105.42s)]
*  Okay. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=109.82000000000001s)]
*  Action sports athlete. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=110.82000000000001s)]
*  Okay. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=111.82000000000001s)]
*  I try to do it all. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=112.82000000000001s)]

*  Okay. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=115.82000000000001s)]
*  Action sports, like, so when you, when people say action sports, that encompasses what? [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=117.11999999999999s)]
*  Anything that's kind of like, I guess, I guess slightly dangerous and considered a [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=125.63999999999999s)]
*  sport. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=130.6s)]
*  Okay. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=131.6s)]

*  Yeah. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=133.6s)]
*  And, and I saw you last night. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=134.6s)]
*  We went to the comedy show. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=136.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=137.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=138.44s)]
*  It was sick. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=139.44s)]
*  Did you have a good time? [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=140.44s)]

*  And I was like, I don't know. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=142.44s)]
*  I went to the comedy store like before that. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=143.78s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=147.14s)]
*  And then, so this was like the second time going somewhere in Hollywood. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=148.14s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=150.66s)]

*  So yeah, you guys, yeah, that was such a surprise, dude. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=153.66s)]
*  So do you have, do you go to a place, so you live in Australia, right? [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=156.94s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=160.46s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=161.46s)]
*  And do you, is there a comedy place you go to there? [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=162.46s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=163.46s)]
*  No, I've actually never seen a comedy show in Australia. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=164.46s)]
*  Wow. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=166.62s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=167.62s)]
*  But, so yeah, I'm living here in Huntington Beach, but usually Sunshine Coast and Australia. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=168.62s)]
*  And you've been to Australia, right? [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=173.42s)]
*  Yeah, I've been to Australia, man. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=174.92s)]
*  I really like Australia. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=176.67999999999998s)]
*  You know, I like a lot of, I like how it all started with the inmates and everything, putting [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=178.72s)]
*  all like the seedy people over there. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=182.56s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=184.56s)]
*  I love seedy people. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=185.56s)]
*  And so I think I love that about it, you know, just seeing the children and grandchildren [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=187.1s)]
*  of seedy people and just seeing like the, you know, all the unique animals. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=190.88s)]
*  It feels almost like a, it feels almost like a, like a secret location kind of, you know? [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=196.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=204.26s)]
*  Or it seems like a, like a practice facility for humanity. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=205.26s)]
*  And mother nature. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=211.18s)]
*  It feels like a training ground for like humans and mother nature. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=212.18s)]
*  That's what I feel like. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=214.74s)]
*  Just to see how it like mixes. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=215.9s)]
*  I feel like it helps. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=217.22s)]
*  It must be like in the blood because I feel like a lot of us have like a few screws loose [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=218.78s)]
*  and that's why you see us in action sports, like just sending it. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=222.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=226.2s)]
*  Oh, there's a different level. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=227.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=228.2s)]
*  Australians have a different thing inside of them. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=229.2s)]
*  And I don't know if it's a science, do they know if it's a scientific thing? [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=230.8s)]
*  You think like if it's like a, uh, maybe generational, I don't know. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=233.52s)]
*  I wonder if there's like that rebellious thing because, cause Australia started because I [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=237.4s)]
*  think they were inmates from England. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=241.96s)]
*  They put them there, right? [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=243.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=244.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=245.36s)]
*  So there was like convicts and they shipped them over cause there was like, they're like, [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=246.36s)]
*  Oh, we're going to free up some space here. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=248.36s)]
*  So send them off to the mainland. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=251.22000000000003s)]
*  We need a little more bandwidth over here at the prison. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=253.14000000000001s)]
*  So we're going to send, we're going to send a couple, a couple of bad boys over there. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=256.06s)]
*  Yeah, dude. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=260.26s)]
*  I love Australia, man. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=261.26s)]
*  I had a great time. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=262.26s)]
*  So how do you, so, so your world is mostly like, take me through how you kind of got [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=264.42s)]
*  started, man. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=268.62s)]
*  Cause I know you and I just met on IG. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=269.62s)]
*  I was in like, I love all your like tricks and it seems so extreme and like I get nervous [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=270.86s)]
*  being at like high speeds and stuff. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=275.94s)]
*  So when I see somebody like you, I'm like, damn, this guy, you know, he's really able [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=278.52s)]
*  to level up like in this, you know, this guy seems like a real, like a, you know, just [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=282.68s)]
*  like a real energy drink of a kind of guy. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=289.48s)]
*  I felt like, yeah. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=292.24s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=293.24s)]
*  I guess it started like where the action sports started was I watched the X games and I like, [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=294.24s)]
*  there was a movie called the ultimate X and it had like guys like Travis Pastrana, Tony [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=300.2s)]
*  Hawk and like I seen that and I think all I had at the time were like rollerblades because [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=304.18s)]
*  my mom took me to the roller drone, you know, so I was like, I want to go to the skate park [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=309.34000000000003s)]
*  now. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=312.98s)]
*  What do I have rollerblades? [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=313.98s)]
*  So I just like went to the skate park of my rollerblades and fell in my butt like 500 [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=315.62s)]
*  times. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=319.18s)]
*  And then pretty much from then on, I was just like the skate park rat, you know, skate park [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=320.18s)]
*  kid. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=324.34000000000003s)]
*  And so at skate parks over there, are people doing drugs and stuff or is it mostly just [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=325.34000000000003s)]
*  skating? [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=329.62s)]
*  I probably find drugs at the skate park, but I like there's certain skate parks like the [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=330.64s)]
*  skate park I mainly go to, it's got a fence around it. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=335.2s)]
*  So you don't just go chill there and do drugs. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=337.52s)]
*  You kind of like pay to go in and you're not going to pay twice to do drugs. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=339.36s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, that's true. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=342.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=343.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=344.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=345.6s)]
*  If you do your drugs and then you go in there, yeah, you want to save that money, I think [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=346.6s)]
*  and just do your drugs outside probably. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=351.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=353.4s)]
*  So when you started, like, did you find that you were good at it in the beginning? [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=354.76s)]
*  Because sometimes I wonder how much of a, to be like an extreme sports person, how much [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=358.41999999999996s)]
*  like, how much like, is it in you? [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=366.73999999999995s)]
*  And then how much is it that you can learn? [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=371.21999999999997s)]
*  Like, I've always felt like something like that is not in me, dude. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=373.26s)]
*  Like, you know, I'll even like, even, you know, sometimes people, like when the car [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=377.06s)]
*  stops real fast, people put their hand over the person. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=381.26s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=383.65999999999997s)]
*  I guess that's what makes people put their hand over me even if we're just kind of cruising [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=384.76000000000005s)]
*  along. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=387.28000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, I guess, I would say, I guess it is built in a little bit. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=388.28000000000003s)]
*  Like you kind of have to be a little bit wild because you've got to get over the hill, you [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=391.88000000000005s)]
*  know, you're going to crash. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=394.52000000000004s)]
*  You are going to crash. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=395.56s)]
*  There's like no way not to really, if you want to push that, that upper level. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=396.56s)]
*  But I guess it is something you could definitely learn. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=401.12s)]
*  Like obviously I started, I started just for fun and I was just like, all my homies were [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=403.64000000000004s)]
*  like down the skate park and then that's why I jumped on a scooter. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=407.96000000000004s)]
*  Because I was like the only rollerblade kid, just all like the lonely rollerblader basically [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=410.85999999999996s)]
*  down the skate park and all my mates rode scooters. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=415.21999999999997s)]
*  And I was like, man, I want to ride with, I want to learn with everybody else. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=417.85999999999996s)]
*  So I ended up like, I had to borrow like their scooter and their shoes because obviously [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=421.65999999999997s)]
*  I rolled later. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=425.46s)]
*  I didn't have shoes. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=426.46s)]
*  You can't rollerblade on the scooter. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=427.46s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=428.46s)]
*  No, well you can if you try hard enough. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=429.46s)]
*  But yeah, pretty much just, it was all fun at the start and then you like build up and [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=431.26s)]
*  just, I don't know, you slowly progress. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=435.46s)]
*  But I guess at the start you obviously have to be able to get hurt and not like cry about [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=437.64s)]
*  it kind of thing. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=442.44s)]
*  You have to like pick yourself up and keep going. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=443.44s)]
*  And if you see somebody with a helmet, like were you helmeted in the beginning or are [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=445.76s)]
*  people in helmets or not? [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=448.32s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, helmeted. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=449.56s)]
*  And is it well received by others if you wear a helmet or is it kind of? [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=450.56s)]
*  It's, it's, it depends what you're doing. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=454.36s)]
*  Like you're not going to go out there and do a triple backflip with no helmet on because [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=456.4s)]
*  if you crash, then you're not going to be doing any more flips after that. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=460.0s)]
*  You know, like you can get seriously hurt. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=464.0s)]
*  But definitely like the skateboarding realm is like, yeah, if you don't, you're not wearing [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=466.62s)]
*  a, if you're wearing a helmet, like only in a stair set, they're like, what are you doing? [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=470.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=474.34000000000003s)]
*  But it's kind of well received in scooter and BMX to wear the helmet because a lot of [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=475.34000000000003s)]
*  people have gotten hurt even with a helmet on and like can't ride anymore. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=479.18s)]
*  So it's like, if everyone wasn't wearing a helmet, then there'd be way less BMX riders [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=482.70000000000005s)]
*  because I think that. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=487.38s)]
*  Oh, it's dangerous. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=488.38s)]
*  It gets that dangerous, huh? [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=489.38s)]
*  It definitely does get dangerous. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=491.26000000000005s)]
*  And it's just like, why not have a helmet on and just protect your noggin? [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=492.64s)]
*  Yeah, I just always, I would never want my kids. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=496.44s)]
*  I don't think to see me in a helmet, you know, if I'm a dad, you know, yeah, like that's [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=498.92s)]
*  such a, yeah, I don't know. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=502.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=503.8s)]
*  I guess you might not suit a helmet. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=504.8s)]
*  I don't think I've ever seen a picture of you in a helmet. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=505.8s)]
*  So yeah. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=507.48s)]
*  And that's probably a reason for that. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=508.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=509.64s)]
*  It's probably a reason for it. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=510.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=511.64s)]
*  But I think, yeah, if a kid sees her dad in a helmet, I think it just does something to [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=512.64s)]
*  a kid that it's just hard to like, you guys' helmets is different because they're more like [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=515.0s)]
*  cool looking helmets. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=518.76s)]
*  But if you're in like one of like, if you're like on a bicycle, like in the neighborhood [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=520.26s)]
*  and you're and your dad drives up the driveway in the bike and he has on a helmet, I feel [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=523.58s)]
*  like it just, I don't know, I would feel so sad for my dad and then I would feel so sad [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=528.26s)]
*  for me, I think. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=532.9s)]
*  Yeah, I guess. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=533.9s)]
*  Like if you're wearing a cyclist helmet, the worst ones, I think, I don't know if you have [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=534.9s)]
*  like birds that sweep you here. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=538.98s)]
*  Like we have magpies in Australia and they like sweep you. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=540.58s)]
*  So you see cyclists, they'll have like a cycling helmet and then they'll have zip ties, like [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=543.38s)]
*  pointing up in the air. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=549.08s)]
*  To keep the birds out? [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=550.32s)]
*  To keep the birds from swooping their heads. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=551.32s)]
*  Yeah, that's crazy, dude. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=552.32s)]
*  Yeah, I used to paint this, I used to paint fences on this man's property and I used to [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=553.32s)]
*  do it with this big kind of urban gentleman and he died actually, but he was alive at [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=558.6800000000001s)]
*  this point and we used to, he also used to cut grass. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=564.84s)]
*  This dude, Johnny was his name, Big Johnny and he wore these, he had like, it was big, [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=567.04s)]
*  he had like real dark skin and he had a big chest hair and he would have these jewel, like [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=571.04s)]
*  a lot of gold and stuff and silver choice chains and stuff in it and he was a homosexual [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=575.3s)]
*  guy actually, I didn't know that at the time, but people said he was later. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=581.3399999999999s)]
*  But anyway, he, the birds would come, he and I would paint these fences and the birds would [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=585.18s)]
*  swoop down because he had a big aphrodisiac, so the birds would swoop down to get into [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=591.3399999999999s)]
*  his hair. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=595.22s)]
*  So at one point, my only responsibility was to have this like badminton racket and just [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=596.22s)]
*  fucking swat away all like these, I want to say it was nightingales, but it might have [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=601.28s)]
*  been something else. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=605.68s)]
*  They were trying to like nest? [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=606.68s)]
*  Yeah, they come in and try to nest at him, he's like, you got my back? [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=607.68s)]
*  I'm like, I got you, bud. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=610.2s)]
*  So I'm just sitting there all day just fucking, just love, love with mother nature, you know. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=611.2s)]
*  But anyway, yeah, so, because yeah, I think sometimes if I had that helmet, it would make [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=619.64s)]
*  me, if I saw my dad on a regular bicycle, but in your sport, you guys need the helmet. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=623.28s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, I'd suggest wearing a helmet just because you could like not even be trying [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=628.66s)]
*  anything crazy and just like fall over and just hit your head. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=633.38s)]
*  And there's like, there's a lot of guys that like have had brain injuries and then they [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=635.82s)]
*  can't ride. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=639.1s)]
*  And it's like if they, and there's big people that get hurt not wearing a helmet and can't [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=640.1s)]
*  ride. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=644.02s)]
*  So it's like, may as well just wear one, but I get where you're coming from, but I'll stick [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=645.02s)]
*  to wearing a helmet, I think. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=648.46s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=650.1s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=651.1s)]
*  Um, so what about this? [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=652.1s)]
*  So you get going, you get, now was it frowned upon that you're in there with the roller [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=653.38s)]
*  blades? [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=657.1999999999999s)]
*  Was that kind of like a? [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=658.1999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, well, yeah, it was because I rolled away for like four years, but it was kind of [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=659.1999999999999s)]
*  like that's all I had, you know? [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=663.52s)]
*  I was just my, I was, I grew up with a single mom and she was like, that's all we could [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=665.68s)]
*  afford right? [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=671.1999999999999s)]
*  We just had the roller blades. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=672.1999999999999s)]
*  And then it's like, I was like, sweet. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=673.1999999999999s)]
*  And then once I started, I was like, man, this is fun. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=674.76s)]
*  Like, this is so fun. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=676.88s)]
*  I'm just going to roll a blade because it's so fun. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=677.88s)]
*  It's the only thing I had tried. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=680.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=681.68s)]
*  So I did that for like four years. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=682.68s)]
*  I can't imagine rollerblading for four years, man. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=683.8199999999999s)]
*  Not straight. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=687.38s)]
*  Like on and off. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=688.38s)]
*  On and off. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=690.62s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=691.62s)]
*  Oh, thank God. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=692.62s)]
*  And so then you get up to the scooter. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=693.62s)]
*  So is that where you start to like make your, like, where do you start to kind of make your [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=694.9399999999999s)]
*  climb in like this fucking like astrophysicist on a scooter? [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=699.3399999999999s)]
*  Like you're like this, like, you're like a bullet kind of like, where do you start to [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=703.8599999999999s)]
*  make your climb then? [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=707.5799999999999s)]
*  Um, I would say like I jump on a scooter. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=708.5799999999999s)]
*  I think I rode for like maybe three or four years and then kind of got sponsored. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=711.68s)]
*  And then once I got sponsored, we did like a trip to the USA. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=717.56s)]
*  And that was like, when I was like, what? [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=721.68s)]
*  Like I'm riding a scooter and like they're flying me over to the USA to just ride skate [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=723.16s)]
*  parks. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=727.9599999999999s)]
*  This is like kind of like mind blowing. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=728.9599999999999s)]
*  This is crazy. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=729.9599999999999s)]
*  So where were you riding when you're riding before you just saw these skate parks locally? [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=730.9599999999999s)]
*  Just the skate parks. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=735.4399999999999s)]
*  And then for about, so yeah, for about five, five or six years, it was just the skate park [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=736.4399999999999s)]
*  stuff. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=740.86s)]
*  And then that's like after that Nitro Circus seen me on YouTube. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=741.86s)]
*  And they were like, oh, let's give this guy going this 40 foot jump and then see what [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=746.14s)]
*  he can do. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=749.26s)]
*  And I was like, let's go. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=750.26s)]
*  I was 17 years old, just like, ready to send it. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=751.26s)]
*  You didn't want it. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=754.5s)]
*  So you didn't have any, so like, yeah, was there a lot of fear or anything? [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=755.5s)]
*  Like what goes, what starts to go away? [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=758.02s)]
*  Does the fear start to go away or take me through some of that process? [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=760.4200000000001s)]
*  Cause you're, let's see if we can pull up one of you's, um, just pull up one of, uh, [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=764.0600000000001s)]
*  I just want to cut you to kind of take me through what's, what some of this is when [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=769.12s)]
*  you like, cause now you do some pretty, you're on like some pretty intense ramps, huh? [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=772.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=777.0s)]
*  Um. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=779.0s)]
*  Probably go like just a single trick. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=782.0s)]
*  Don't do the, just having like triple front flip. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=783.84s)]
*  That's a good one. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=789.72s)]
*  That's probably my hardest one on screwdart. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=790.72s)]
*  Okay. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=791.72s)]
*  Let's look for that one. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=792.72s)]
*  I'm flipping the top. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=793.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=795.72s)]
*  Ah, no, down one. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=801.72s)]
*  Yep. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=802.72s)]
*  There we go. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=803.72s)]
*  I'm probably just skipping a little bit, but this one was crazy because it was like, they [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=805.72s)]
*  built this jump just for me to do this trick. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=811.5s)]
*  Wow. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=814.62s)]
*  And like, the thing is, I'm always scared. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=815.62s)]
*  Like, I'm always scared. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=818.0600000000001s)]
*  The fear's always there. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=819.78s)]
*  It's just the confidence is built, built up, you know, I've gained confidence in my abilities [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=821.06s)]
*  in myself. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=825.56s)]
*  Hey, hold on. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=826.56s)]
*  We can hear that in here. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=827.56s)]
*  It's too loud in here. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=828.56s)]
*  Sorry. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=829.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=830.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=831.56s)]
*  I don't even think we need the audio of it if we can. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=832.56s)]
*  We can probably just look at the video. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=835.8s)]
*  Okay. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=837.1199999999999s)]
*  So right here. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=838.1199999999999s)]
*  So they're building this. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=839.1199999999999s)]
*  They built this ramp. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=840.1199999999999s)]
*  So this is at Travis Ostrona's house. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=841.1199999999999s)]
*  So is this when you, once you get on this, is this once you get over here to the U S [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=842.3599999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=845.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=846.92s)]
*  On that tour? [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=847.92s)]
*  Nah, not that first tour. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=848.92s)]
*  And then I'm like, this is when I'm kind of really starting my career. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=850.78s)]
*  Wow. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=855.14s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=856.14s)]
*  But this is [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=857.14s)]
*  You look like a full on Dame from fucking Adelaide, bro. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=858.14s)]
*  You look like a single mom from Adelaide. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=862.4599999999999s)]
*  I don't know what look I was going for there. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=864.4599999999999s)]
*  But yeah, they built this ramp just for this trick. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=866.62s)]
*  And I was so scared because no one had ever landed a triple front flip on BMX. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=869.14s)]
*  And it's still like one of the hardest tricks I've ever done, even though this is like, [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=872.4599999999999s)]
*  I don't know, seven years ago. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=875.74s)]
*  Dude, now did you, did these guys think you could do it? [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=878.08s)]
*  Are guys like sight for each other? [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=880.32s)]
*  Is it like a lot of camaraderie? [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=882.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=883.04s)]
*  That's the thing about action sports is that like, we know that if the other guy doesn't [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=884.04s)]
*  land it, like he can get really hurt. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=887.64s)]
*  So it's all just like, we're all homies. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=889.16s)]
*  Everyone's cheering everyone on. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=891.72s)]
*  No one wants anyone to fail. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=892.72s)]
*  We want everyone to win. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=894.4s)]
*  Right. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=895.72s)]
*  And this is my homie. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=896.72s)]
*  I was actually racing him to do the first one and he, he got, he got to do the first [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=897.72s)]
*  attempt and yeah, you'll see it's just explosion. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=902.08s)]
*  Jesus. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=905.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=906.78s)]
*  And is that a children's bike? [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=907.78s)]
*  I mean, kind of, it's a full, it's a full man bike. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=909.74s)]
*  Okay. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=912.78s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=913.78s)]
*  A kid could ride it though. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=914.78s)]
*  Yeah, it was not, it was, it was wild. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=915.78s)]
*  So when you're going up this, like what speed are you going to whenever you hit this, whenever [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=919.22s)]
*  you go up this ramp? [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=922.74s)]
*  I think we had a speed dominant and it was like 35 miles per hour, 35, 40. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=923.9399999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=930.7s)]
*  And so, all right, so you get on this bike. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=932.7s)]
*  I just like, what I do is kind of like, you can close your, you know, you can close your [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=936.16s)]
*  eyes and you can write your name, you know? [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=939.8s)]
*  Right. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=942.24s)]
*  You know, so it's like that I've, I've wrote a BMX so long that I can like picture it in [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=943.24s)]
*  my head before I even do it. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=948.56s)]
*  So it's like, I just close my eyes and I like have like a simulator in my brain that I've [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=950.16s)]
*  created over like 15 years of riding action sports and I can just play that trick out [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=955.56s)]
*  boom boom in my head 30 times before I drop in and then I drop in and it's like, okay, [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=959.88s)]
*  this is what I have to do. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=965.58s)]
*  I'm doing it and then as I'm doing it, I'm like calculating, okay, is this what was meant [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=966.58s)]
*  to be happening? [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=970.46s)]
*  Is this what I imagined was going to be happening? [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=971.46s)]
*  And if it is, I'm like, sweet, stay on. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=973.86s)]
*  And if I'm looking and I'm seeing something else, I'm like, all right, how am I not, how [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=976.82s)]
*  do I not land on my head right now? [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=980.66s)]
*  Right. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=982.1800000000001s)]
*  So at a certain point, it's just, you realize it's kind of survival. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=983.1800000000001s)]
*  Like if it's, if something feels a little bit off or something, you realize at that [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=985.22s)]
*  point I just needed to land, I need to land safely and redo it. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=988.0600000000001s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=991.1s)]
*  So like I'm a professional crasher, I would say as well. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=992.1s)]
*  To be a professional action sports athlete, you have to be a professional crasher because [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=994.58s)]
*  if you, if you can't crash, then you can't get back up and try again. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=998.96s)]
*  Manscaped has been busy and just launched the redefined body wash and two-in-one shampoo [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=1003.84s)]
*  plus conditioner. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=1009.3000000000001s)]
*  They have everything you need to take care of your body and keep your hair tidy. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=1010.6800000000001s)]
*  Damn it. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=1016.36s)]
*  Do well, look decent. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=1017.6800000000001s)]
*  It's your crotch. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=1019.32s)]

*  That was a triple front flip on BMX. [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=1216.66s)]
*  Okay. [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=1218.74s)]
*  And it had never been done before? [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=1219.74s)]
*  No. [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=1221.1s)]
*  Inhuman by human by anybody? [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=1222.1s)]
*  I don't think by anyone. [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=1224.18s)]
*  Okay. [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=1225.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=1226.18s)]
*  I haven't seen any animals do it either. [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=1227.18s)]
*  So if you, when you're going up, you're going up that ramp, how do you then get your bike [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=1228.18s)]
*  to flip frontward? [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=1232.74s)]
*  Because it would seem like you're going to go backwards. [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=1233.74s)]
*  Have you ever done a flip? [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=1236.66s)]
*  I've done a flip on a trampoline, yeah. [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=1237.66s)]
*  It's kind of similar to that, but it's like obviously wheels, different inertia. [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=1240.94s)]
*  But it's like, so what I do, the way I do it is I would ride up, right? [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=1244.7s)]
*  And then I initiate the front flip by throwing my upper body over the front of the bike, [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=1249.14s)]
*  right? [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=1254.66s)]
*  And then it's going to tip the bike up. [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=1255.66s)]
*  When do you do that? [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=1256.66s)]
*  Like, do you know when to do it? [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=1257.66s)]
*  Yeah, I have to do it a little bit early on that triple front flip because obviously it's [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=1258.66s)]
*  three flips, not one. [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=1261.46s)]
*  One flip you can be like, just chill. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=1263.06s)]
*  And it comes around. [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=1265.5s)]
*  Two flips, then you have to give it more. [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=1266.5s)]
*  Three flips is like, okay, I just have to put everything into it. [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=1268.46s)]
*  And I actually like nose manual, which is like where you go on the front wheel. [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=1270.98s)]
*  So I'll be going on one wheel up the ramp before I'm even off the top. [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=1274.32s)]
*  And then that's what just flicks me. [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=1278.3799999999999s)]
*  And then... [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=1280.1799999999998s)]
*  Wow. [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=1281.1799999999998s)]
*  So when you leave the ramp, you're only on that front wheel. [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=1282.1799999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=1283.4199999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=1284.4199999999998s)]
*  On that trick. [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=1285.4199999999998s)]
*  Wow. [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=1286.4199999999998s)]
*  Because I have to just give it everything. [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=1287.4199999999998s)]
*  Can you feel that front wheel catch the edge of that ramp at all or no? [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=1288.4199999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=1290.06s)]
*  It hits that trick. [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=1291.06s)]
*  I had bruises on my legs because the bike would press against my legs so hard because [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=1292.3s)]
*  I would throw so hard that the handlebars would hit me in the legs. [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=1297.58s)]
*  And that's how I knew I was spinning fast because I was like, oh yeah, I felt that. [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=1300.82s)]
*  And then you feel the flick and you just kind of hold on for the ride. [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=1304.82s)]
*  And so at that point, do you just hope that you land at the exact right kind of timing? [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=1307.82s)]
*  Or is the ramp built so that you could kind of, as long as you're coming, you can come [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=1312.3s)]
*  in at a lot of different angles and land? [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=1317.46s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=1319.22s)]
*  Obviously the ramp is like 50% of the trick, because it's like you got to have the right [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=1320.38s)]
*  trajectory. [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=1324.98s)]
*  If you're coming into a flat surface, you're just going to explode. [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=1325.98s)]
*  Oh wow. [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=1328.58s)]
*  So you need to like, it's almost like a plane. [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=1329.58s)]
*  It comes in around just smooth like that. [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=1330.58s)]
*  So it's like when we land, we want to be landing in the trajectory of the landing so that's [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=1333.02s)]
*  smoother. [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=1338.26s)]
*  But it's still a hard landing. [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=1339.26s)]
*  So all the places where you land, usually it has to be at an angle so that- [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=1340.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=1344.38s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=1345.38s)]
*  Because you couldn't just do it flat. [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=1346.38s)]
*  No, not safely. [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=1347.38s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=1348.5400000000002s)]
*  There is like a certain level. [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=1349.5400000000002s)]
*  And once you pass that level, your bones can't do it. [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=1351.8200000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=1355.7800000000002s)]
*  That's a fucking homemade Halloween, baby, you know? [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=1356.7800000000002s)]
*  Damn, bro. [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=1361.74s)]
*  That's crazy, man. [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=1362.8600000000001s)]
*  So okay. [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=1364.38s)]
*  So take me through some of this. [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=1365.38s)]
*  So you start to get, are you in school at this point? [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=1366.74s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=1369.5400000000002s)]
*  So I started- [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=1370.5400000000002s)]
*  So whenever you kind of get going, you get on the scooter, right? [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=1371.5400000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=1373.5800000000002s)]
*  And is scooter frowned upon? [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=1374.5800000000002s)]
*  I mean, scooter, like you see somebody on a scooter. [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=1375.5800000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=1377.78s)]
*  You don't think like, oh, look at this guy. [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=1378.78s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=1381.58s)]
*  And that's kind of a cool thing when I'm doing these nachlickers tours because especially [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=1382.58s)]
*  here in America, they're like, are you going to take that scooter down that ramp? [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=1386.5s)]
*  And I'm like, bro, I'm going to do way more than just take it down the ramp. [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=1390.98s)]
*  But yeah, when I first started, obviously scootering was like, it was just fun, man. [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=1394.82s)]
*  And we did get, it was like skateboarders would be like, why are you riding a scooter? [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=1399.54s)]
*  You're not going to get anywhere riding a scooter, dude. [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=1403.6599999999999s)]
*  I'm like, well, I'm just having fun, man. [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=1405.74s)]
*  I'm not really trying to get anywhere. [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=1408.18s)]
*  I'm just trying to get to the skate park and do some stunts. [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=1409.18s)]
*  But yeah, I got heaps of grief for that, like bullied, obviously. [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=1412.0200000000002s)]
*  But was there a lot of people scootering? [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=1416.0200000000002s)]
*  Were more people starting to do it? [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=1417.3400000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=1419.0600000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=1420.0600000000002s)]
*  And that was like blowing up. [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=1421.0600000000002s)]
*  Right. [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=1422.0600000000002s)]
*  And I was like on the forefront of that. [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=1423.0600000000002s)]
*  And then it's kind of like, that's why I got to catch this wave of like new age scooter [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=1424.0600000000002s)]
*  dudes, right? [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=1428.3000000000002s)]

*  So I was like in the forefront and I could create tricks because like the tricks that [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=1432.42s)]
*  I was doing 10 years ago, like 10,000 kids can do it now. [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=1437.1s)]
*  Whereas it was like a world's first 10 years ago. [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=1441.58s)]
*  It was like being at the front of like, it was like buying Bitcoin, you know? [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=1443.94s)]
*  It was like being at the forefront, like people were like, why are you going to buy Bitcoin? [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=1447.58s)]
*  And then like the dudes that did were like, yeah, now. [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=1450.98s)]
*  So it's like, that's what I'm doing. [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=1453.34s)]
*  It's like I got in that first wave of scooters and then now I'm here like, yeah. [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=1454.94s)]
*  Crazy. [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=1460.38s)]
*  Okay. [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=1461.38s)]
*  I see, man. [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=1462.38s)]
*  Wow. [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=1463.38s)]
*  And did you just feel like, did you try skateboarding as well? [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=1465.0200000000002s)]
*  Did you try other things in the beginning and you just felt most capable with the scooter [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=1468.18s)]
*  or what makes you stay with that? [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=1473.1000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I think that the biggest thing was just my mates did it, you know? [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=1474.5400000000002s)]
*  And I just wanted to hang out with all my friends and like if all my mates skateboarded, [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=1477.7800000000002s)]
*  I probably would have been a skateboarder. [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=1480.98s)]
*  I probably would have went that direction because I did have a skateboard and I would [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=1482.18s)]
*  skateboard when my mates skateboarded. [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=1485.66s)]
*  I would ride a BMX when my mates rode a BMX and that was kind of the thing. [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=1487.22s)]
*  I would go to the skate park. [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=1490.22s)]
*  I was like, I don't know, I was like a treasure trove of action sports. [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=1491.82s)]
*  I would just bring like everything I could to the skate park just in case like more people [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=1494.42s)]
*  were doing that. [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=1498.66s)]
*  I'd be like, okay, it's time for the skateboard today. [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=1499.66s)]
*  And then I would just do that. [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=1502.26s)]
*  And that's kind of like why I picked up scootering so much just because my mates are doing it. [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=1504.42s)]
*  And it was just the coolest vibe to go down to the skate park, have your mates, learn [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=1509.1399999999999s)]
*  new tricks and then. [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=1512.74s)]
*  Fuck, that's sick. [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=1513.94s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=1514.94s)]
*  So that's why I stick with the scooter, even though I got a lot of grief for it at the start. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=1515.94s)]
*  And at school, so it was just you were you an only child? [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=1521.78s)]

*  Come for the freaking dangerous animals stay for the free fruit. [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=1669.38s)]
*  So you got this park and now how much does this park kind of cost to that that kind of space? [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=1674.9s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=1680.66s)]
*  So I mean, the land's like over half a million for the land, but that's like, [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=1680.9s)]
*  you know, it's like that everywhere. [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=1686.98s)]
*  So it's like that's general. [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=1688.3400000000001s)]
*  But the ramp is like $5,000. [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=1689.38s)]
*  And then for that big airbag thing, [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=1692.9s)]
*  like it's a bag jump and that things like cost me like close to 50 grand. [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=1694.9s)]
*  Wow. [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=1700.02s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=1700.5800000000002s)]
*  But then I've got another one that's like a landing. [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=1700.8200000000002s)]
*  So like you switch you go from that. [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=1702.66s)]
*  That is what I practice my tricks on and like you can land on like your head and be kind of all right. [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=1705.14s)]
*  And then once you get your trick down, you switch it to the landing and then you can [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=1709.94s)]
*  like fully land the trick, you know, like claim the the new trick, you know. [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=1713.7s)]
*  Okay. [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=1717.8600000000001s)]
*  So you would then move that out of that space and put the ramp in that you know you can land on. [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=1718.1000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=1722.9s)]
*  Wow. [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=1723.86s)]
*  Is that a crazy day? [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=1724.26s)]
*  Oh man, it is like it's I've had it for like a year and a half now and it's just insane because [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=1725.54s)]
*  the best thing is I have my mates from the skate park. [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=1730.6599999999999s)]
*  Obviously, I got great opportunity with Nitro Circus. [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=1732.8999999999999s)]
*  You know, I got to ride these ramps and go to these places and like progress myself. [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=1735.1399999999999s)]
*  But my mates obviously stuck at home. [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=1739.9399999999998s)]
*  They didn't have anything like that. [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=1741.62s)]
*  So now it's so funny to see the mates that I grew up with like 10 years ago [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=1742.82s)]
*  that were just riding the skate park. [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=1747.3s)]
*  Now they're riding like this mega ramp at mine and doing tricks that like no one else has done as well. [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=1748.6599999999999s)]
*  So they're progressing and becoming the best rider they can be because I've got it. [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=1753.46s)]
*  And it's a trip as well because I get like young scooter kids, [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=1757.38s)]
*  like 10 year old kids coming in and doing double backflips. [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=1761.22s)]
*  And I'm like, what is even going on? [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=1764.26s)]
*  I was like, I don't even know what I was doing when I was 10. [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=1766.26s)]
*  You're going to see, yeah, like they're passing. [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=1768.82s)]
*  It's like, oh yeah, yeah, it's like it's I'm sure it's interesting to be a part of the [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=1770.82s)]
*  kind of the movement in a way. [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=1775.14s)]
*  Okay, so you get to this Nitro Circus. [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=1778.02s)]
*  Let's go back in time a little. [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=1779.78s)]
*  So you get onto this thing where you're going, now you're going to go tour in America. [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=1781.22s)]
*  Yeah, so you got signed the video. [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=1785.7s)]
*  You had some videos that got out and you got signed by Nitro Circus. [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=1788.1000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, so I did, I got signed by Nitro Circus and the first one was actually in Australia. [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=1791.46s)]
*  And it was just like some company Scooter Heart, they had paid to do advertising there. [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=1796.18s)]
*  And then Nitro Circus was like, oh, who are some scooter kids, like up and coming scooter kids [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=1800.98s)]
*  that can come jump this ramp? [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=1805.8600000000001s)]
*  And I was one of them. [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=1807.06s)]
*  And I just, on my first show, I did like a world's first double front flip on scooter. [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=1808.26s)]
*  And then from then on, it was like, I was just on and it was just, it was mind blowing. [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=1813.46s)]
*  I was like, oh, like this is insane. [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=1817.3s)]
*  And did you, so at this point, do you have like a girlfriend already at this point? [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=1819.14s)]
*  Do you have like? [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=1824.1000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I think I did have a girlfriend. [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=1824.74s)]
*  I was because I was in school in that and yeah, and it was like obviously traveling and stuff. [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=1826.5s)]
*  It was hard, but this was like when I'm 17. [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=1830.74s)]
*  So it was like a school girlfriend, you know? [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=1832.9s)]
*  Right. [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=1836.02s)]
*  And were you like, were you becoming like a lot of pretty popular in your area and stuff like that? [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=1836.58s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=1842.1s)]
*  Definitely at the skate park and like at school, people knew I was like flying. [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=1842.74s)]
*  I literally was doing school Monday to Friday and then flying out and doing a Nitro Circus show [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=1846.02s)]
*  and then flying home and doing school. [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=1851.46s)]
*  So it was like a trip, but yeah, I was kind of a nerd in school too. [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=1854.26s)]
*  So I finished school and got into university, but I didn't choose to do that. [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=1857.46s)]
*  Now in Australia, do you have to go to university or you don't have to? [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=1861.3s)]
*  Nah, you can drop out early. [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=1864.18s)]
*  I could have already been out of school when I was doing Nitro Circus and just being like a laborer. [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=1866.9s)]
*  Right. [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=1870.5800000000002s)]
*  But you can go, yeah. [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=1870.9s)]
*  It's pretty, it's like pretty, wow, West over there is sick. [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=1873.7s)]
*  Yeah, it's so good, man. [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=1876.66s)]
*  Okay, so then you get on this tour and you guys start to come to America. [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=1879.22s)]
*  Is your mom like stoked for you? [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=1882.02s)]
*  Is she disappointed? [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=1883.6200000000001s)]
*  Like is she bummed that you're leaving? [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=1884.74s)]
*  Like what are some of her thoughts? [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=1886.3400000000001s)]
*  Yeah, she was like, obviously she was worried at the start, you know? [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=1887.78s)]
*  I'm risking my life kind of and I could get really hurt. [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=1892.8200000000002s)]
*  So yeah, you're fucking around on a scooter. [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=1896.3400000000001s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=1898.02s)]
*  I'm saying like, there's always, until you make it and it's really professional, [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=1899.0600000000002s)]
*  whatever any child I think is doing for their parents, the parents are always like, [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=1905.0600000000002s)]
*  what the fuck? [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=1908.98s)]
*  You know, you're fucking around, you know? [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=1909.7s)]
*  I want you to do well, but you're fucking around here. [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=1911.38s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, for sure. [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=1913.54s)]
*  But until you really start to do well. [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=1914.5s)]
*  And then she obviously gained confidence in myself and I was pretty lucky with injury [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=1916.74s)]
*  and just like being calculated and not just like throwing myself out there. [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=1921.38s)]
*  Because that's always been the biggest thing. [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=1924.66s)]
*  It's like we're not daredevils. [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=1925.94s)]
*  We are in a way, but we're all, I'm like calculating the risk. [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=1927.7s)]
*  It's like, is it worth doing this? [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=1930.3400000000001s)]
*  Is the reward worth it? [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=1932.42s)]
*  Yes. [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=1934.1000000000001s)]
*  Okay. [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=1934.42s)]
*  Send it. [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=1934.9s)]
*  Oops, broke my leg, but was worth it. [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=1935.3000000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=1938.74s)]
*  But yeah, so I got on Nitro Circus and then that's kind of when things started to really [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=1939.46s)]
*  blow up for me. [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=1945.5400000000002s)]
*  And that's like when I started to really get a name. [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=1946.18s)]
*  And then that just made me more stoked to be writing and like do better because I was [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=1949.62s)]
*  like, man, me having fun doing these tricks that I love doing is like progressing me through [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=1953.4599999999998s)]
*  life. [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=1958.5s)]
*  This is like a trip. [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=1958.82s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=1960.02s)]
*  It is crazy when like your dream or something that you're really putting energy into [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=1960.9799999999998s)]
*  that the world kind of meets that, like starts to like kind of push that forward. [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=1965.06s)]
*  You're like, what? [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=1970.6599999999999s)]
*  This is crazy. [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=1971.4599999999998s)]
*  Like, why me? [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=1972.4199999999998s)]
*  Like, why do I get to have this? [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=1973.1399999999999s)]
*  Like this? [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=1975.2199999999998s)]
*  Why do I get to be met this way by the flow of life? [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=1977.06s)]
*  I think honestly, a huge thing for me too was the fact that I did get grief for riding a [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=1983.22s)]
*  scooter. [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=1989.62s)]
*  I got bullied for riding a scooter by like other people. [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=1990.1s)]
*  Oh, it's probably, dude, if I drove by, I yelled something. [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=1992.5s)]
*  But then that was like, that's like sick. [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=1996.02s)]
*  Like whatever, I just took it right on the chin and was like, I'm going to be so good [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=1997.78s)]
*  that you can't not be impressed. [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=2002.1799999999998s)]
*  That was like, that was it. [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=2004.82s)]
*  That's like, was my driving force. [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=2006.02s)]
*  Like my fire in my belly was like, all right, so you think that this is so bad that you [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=2007.86s)]
*  can't be cool. [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=2012.98s)]

*  Yeah. [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=2534.74s)]
*  So obviously when I first got on Nitro, it was like, I was 17 years old. [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=2534.98s)]
*  So I was, it was great money for them. [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=2539.7799999999997s)]

*  or not even that actually, probably, probably a year after starting with Nitro. [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=2550.6600000000003s)]
*  Then I was like, okay, I can literally do this for a job. [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=2554.1800000000003s)]

*  And then just kept going from there. [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=2563.86s)]
*  Like crazy to ride a scooter and then like to make such a good living. [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=2565.78s)]
*  It's just, it's a trip. [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=2570.5s)]
*  Yeah. One thing I noticed about you, even in watching some of your own podcast clips [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=2572.1s)]

*  in my life, but sometimes I get embarrassed that I make money or embarrassed that I'm, [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=2590.98s)]
*  you know, have like, you know, you seem to just kind of wear it, just kind of more like excited. [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=2595.14s)]

*  And that was the trippiest thing for me when I got on Nitrosickers was [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=2943.54s)]
*  the first show I'm on this scooter kid and I do this well first. [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=2946.74s)]
*  And I remember after I did it, I was like so stoked. [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=2950.18s)]
*  But the biggest thing I remember from that day is riding back to the start ramp [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=2953.3s)]
*  and Travis high-fived me and going, dude, that was sick. [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=2957.62s)]
*  That was so cool. [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=2962.02s)]
*  And I was like, wow, this is insane that this guy that I hold up like this, [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=2963.06s)]
*  I've held up, inspired me to even start for him to just give me that. [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=2969.78s)]
*  It was like a year's worth of excitement in one second. [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=2974.98s)]
*  Wow. [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=2979.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=2980.98s)]
*  It's so amazing, man, when you have somebody that you really idolize [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=2981.2200000000003s)]
*  or you really put on a pedestal and they have a little bit of time for you [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=2987.1400000000003s)]
*  or they have like an encouragement that really helps, you know? [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=2991.3s)]
*  Man, the power of that is almost unprecedented really, I think. [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=2994.9s)]
*  I think that and I always keep that in mind because we obviously do these Nitrosickers shows [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=2998.42s)]
*  and it's like there's thousands of people there and like kids will want to come get a photo, [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3002.7400000000002s)]
*  take a picture, get an autograph. [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3007.0600000000004s)]
*  And that's what I always remember. [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3009.3s)]
*  I always remember like five seconds of Travis Pastrana's time [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3010.9s)]
*  was like a year's worth of just excitement for me. [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3015.78s)]
*  So it's like if I can give a kid five seconds of my time and it means that much to him, [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3018.74s)]
*  I'm going to give that kid that five seconds every single time, you know? [[00:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3023.62s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3027.14s)]
*  It keeps you stoked. [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3027.3799999999997s)]
*  And so y'all's show, so you said you hit a first trick and that was on one of the Nitroses? [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3028.66s)]
*  On one of the? [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3033.54s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3034.3399999999997s)]
*  So it was just a double front flip on Scooter and like no one had ever tried it. [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3034.8199999999997s)]
*  And what you did, we saw earlier was a triple, right? [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3039.22s)]
*  Triple, yeah. [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3041.06s)]
*  So that evolved obviously into that triple. [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3041.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3044.5s)]
*  And did you start to, when you got on the tour, [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3044.82s)]
*  prepping for that trick, you'd already done it in practice? [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3049.2200000000003s)]
*  I had tried. [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3052.5800000000004s)]
*  So when I first got on the show, I tried it in practice and crashed it twice. [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3053.46s)]
*  Okay. [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3056.7400000000002s)]
*  So that's what made the moment so special is that like it was my first show. [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3057.2200000000003s)]
*  I'm obviously like so excited, like and so nervous, but to ace that trick, [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3060.1800000000003s)]
*  it was like something happened. [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3065.54s)]
*  Like it was like the trajectory of my life just went, and I was like, okay, I'm doing it. [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3068.02s)]
*  Wow. [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3073.46s)]
*  Damn. [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3074.82s)]
*  You must feel like there's like a higher power or something that has a hand in that when you, [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3076.02s)]
*  because it just the science and everything to like flip off of something and just have [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3080.1000000000004s)]
*  it be perfect in a moment where it's like in a real show. [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3085.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3088.5s)]
*  Well, that's, I think that that's where I've done really well. [[00:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3089.1400000000003s)]
*  Like I never think that I'm someone that is physically built better or like [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3093.2200000000003s)]
*  wired better than anybody else. [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3098.9s)]
*  I think I just managed to like succeed when it's most important. [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3100.42s)]
*  It's like at X Games, it's like I need to do land this trick now and then I'll just land it. [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3105.38s)]
*  You know, but I obviously do the preparation, but for some reason it's just sick to [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3110.7400000000002s)]
*  in moments of when I need to do it, I got it done. [[00:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3117.38s)]
*  And I think that's the main reason why I got to where I am today. [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3120.9s)]
*  Well, it's like, it's wild. [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3124.26s)]
*  I mean, it's yeah, it almost feels like you're favored. [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3127.3s)]
*  In some sense. [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3130.42s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3131.1400000000003s)]
*  I obviously, and I just thank whatever the driving force is. [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3131.6200000000003s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3135.46s)]
*  And I try to thank it every day. [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3135.86s)]
*  And I try to give back like my positivity to the people around me because maybe that'll [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3136.9s)]
*  turn their trajectory. [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3141.86s)]
*  You know, maybe that'll do, you know, that one moment might change their life and they [[00:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3142.9s)]
*  might do something better and be better in the end. [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3146.7400000000002s)]
*  You know, so. [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3149.94s)]

*  And I don't know where that comes from. [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3183.94s)]
*  I think it comes from. [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3185.0600000000004s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3186.66s)]

*  I don't know. [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3213.14s)]
*  So what happened? [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3214.34s)]
*  Like that was kind of like another thing that changed. [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3215.3s)]
*  Yeah, so they the shows are huge and then they had a thing called Nitro World Games and it was like a competition now. [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3218.42s)]
*  So they changed the show, changed it to a competition. [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3224.42s)]
*  That was obviously the X Games. [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3228.1800000000003s)]
*  Right. [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3229.7000000000003s)]
*  And that was a huge one that I wanted to do. [[00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3230.26s)]
*  But obviously I was like a scooter rider and a BMX rider at a certain point. [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3231.94s)]
*  It's funny, funny story. [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3236.1800000000003s)]
*  I can't remember. [[00:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3237.3s)]
*  I can't remember. [[00:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3237.94s)]
*  I can't remember. [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3238.6600000000003s)]
*  I can't remember. [[00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3239.3s)]
*  I can't remember. [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3240.1s)]
*  I can't remember. [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3240.9s)]
*  I can't remember. [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3241.54s)]
*  I can't remember. [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3242.26s)]
*  Funny story, actually. [[00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3243.14s)]
*  So I rode BMX at the skate park here and there, but it wasn't like my profession, right? [[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3244.18s)]
*  Right. [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3248.26s)]
*  And then at Nitro Circus, I was doing tricks on a scooter that had never been done on a BMX bike. [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3248.58s)]
*  Wait, hold on. [[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3256.34s)]
*  So you're doing tricks on a scooter that's never been done on a BMX bike. [[00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3257.14s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3261.62s)]
*  OK, you can do the same. [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3262.02s)]
*  You can do the same tricks. [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3263.14s)]
*  Obviously just a different vehicle. [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3264.18s)]
*  But so I was doing tricks that I could do on a scooter that no one had never done on BMX. [[00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3265.62s)]
*  And so did someone challenge you to do it on the BMX? [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3270.82s)]
*  That's it. [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3272.74s)]
*  They were like, the only reason you can do this is because you're on a scooter. [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3273.3799999999997s)]
*  And I was like, you know what? [[00:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3276.9799999999996s)]
*  I reckon that's not true. [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3278.8199999999997s)]
*  And I ended up borrowing one of their bikes, like one of the other guys on tour. [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3282.4199999999996s)]
*  I borrowed their bike and I did the trick. [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3286.18s)]
*  I think I was like, first try, I did it. [[00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3289.2999999999997s)]
*  And then that's when I was like, here we go. [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3291.06s)]
*  X Games dream. [[00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3294.66s)]
*  I can reach it. [[00:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3295.54s)]
*  Like all I have to do is bring these scooter tricks over to the BMX world because no one's [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3296.18s)]
*  doing it for some reason because they think it's lame or something. [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3300.9s)]
*  Right. [[00:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3303.14s)]
*  And I'm like, oh well, I don't mind. [[00:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3303.46s)]
*  I'll just do the lame tricks then and win. [[00:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3305.54s)]
*  I'll just be the lame legend. [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3307.62s)]
*  Yeah, that's it. [[00:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3309.38s)]
*  Sorry, if you need me, I'll be in lame land. [[00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3310.26s)]
*  Drinking lemonade, baby. [[00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3314.1s)]
*  I'll be up there, dog. [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3315.62s)]
*  Damn. [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3317.2200000000003s)]
*  That's beautiful, dude. [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3318.26s)]
*  So now at that point, did you win that thing? [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3319.54s)]
*  Yeah, so I won the Nitro World Games. [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3322.1800000000003s)]
*  The first year it happened, I actually lost the scooter competition and won the BMX competition, [[00:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3324.9s)]
*  which was kind of hilarious. [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3330.26s)]
*  And then came back the next year and I won scooter and BMX. [[00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3331.6200000000003s)]
*  And then I think it was like the year after I finally got on X Games. [[00:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3335.94s)]
*  And then yeah, I've won three X Games golds now. [[00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3339.6200000000003s)]
*  Has anybody won three X Games golds or no? [[00:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3344.1000000000004s)]
*  So yeah, people have won, like Travis has won so many. [[00:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3346.7400000000002s)]
*  I think he's got like some of the most, but like that's, they're up like in the 20s, you know? [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3350.1000000000004s)]
*  But that, I think, so I did accomplish something recently. [[00:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3353.94s)]
*  I won, I was the first person to do three golds in a row on the Mega Amp. [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3358.4199999999996s)]
*  So for some reason, for 20 years, it had never happened that a person had consecutively won [[00:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3363.8599999999997s)]
*  three gold medals in a row on the Mega Amp. [[00:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3370.18s)]
*  And it made me so nervous. [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3372.18s)]
*  Really? [[00:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3373.2999999999997s)]
*  Because I was coming to the, I was coming into the third one, like, oh, here we go. [[00:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3373.7799999999997s)]
*  Like time just kept repeating itself. [[00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3376.8999999999996s)]
*  I think like five people before me had won it twice and then they lost the third time. [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3378.3399999999997s)]
*  So I was like, here we go. [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3383.7s)]
*  So the third time, is there a video that you did? [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3385.06s)]
*  Yeah, you go X Games, Ryan Williams X Games, 2018, I think? Or 19. [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3387.38s)]
*  Try, I'll tell you straight away. [[00:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3402.1s)]
*  Nah, nah, go 19. [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3404.1s)]
*  Not that one. [[00:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3409.38s)]
*  The, that one, the real cost, big air, but it's a full broadcast. [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3410.26s)]
*  Go, go the second, go to the next one down. [[00:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3415.06s)]
*  Yeah, try that one real quick. [[00:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3418.34s)]
*  Wow, that's so high. [[00:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3422.1800000000003s)]
*  So this isn't my winning run, but you'll see like, wait, is this it? [[00:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3424.02s)]
*  No, this is, if I crash, it's not it. [[00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3429.62s)]
*  No. [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3434.42s)]
*  No, that was, keep skipping in, sorry. [[00:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3435.54s)]
*  Oh, hang on. [[00:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3439.7000000000003s)]
*  This is going to play all of them. [[00:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3440.26s)]
*  This is good. [[00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3441.2200000000003s)]
*  This is good actually. [[00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3441.86s)]
*  So keep it rolling. [[00:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3444.7400000000002s)]
*  So that was, this was the first time I won and this was in Australia. [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3446.66s)]
*  So my first time I ever won X Games was in Australia. [[00:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3450.18s)]
*  My whole family there, I paid for everyone to fly down and stay there. [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3452.58s)]
*  And it was, oh, it was like so incredible because that was like my dream achieved, you know? [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3457.22s)]
*  A gold medal at the X Games. [[00:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3462.18s)]
*  Oh man, it's not this one though. [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3464.66s)]
*  Go back to, go back to the search. [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3466.3399999999997s)]

*  I feel like- [[00:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3477.14s)]
*  A little bit, honestly. [[00:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3477.62s)]
*  At that point, dude. [[00:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3479.06s)]
*  I know, I had to dial it back, dude. [[00:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3480.58s)]
*  I didn't know what I was doing. [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3483.06s)]
*  You were going big, dude, but you had a total, [[00:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3484.5s)]
*  it was like a real Karen kind of haircut, I feel like, at that point. [[00:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3486.42s)]
*  It's hard to- [[00:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3489.14s)]

*  This is it. [[00:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3497.94s)]
*  I had to do the craziest thing at the start. [[00:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3498.58s)]
*  This was the gnarliest thing I've ever done. [[00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3500.18s)]
*  I've never done a backflip drop in. [[00:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3501.62s)]
*  Okay. [[00:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3503.06s)]
*  Wow. [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3504.26s)]
*  Yes, and then I nearly missed up the ramp. [[00:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3506.1800000000003s)]
*  I rode up like the tiniest part of the ramp. [[00:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3507.94s)]
*  And then I'm like, here, I'm like, oh gosh, I gotta land this, gotta land this, [[00:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3510.82s)]

*  Oh man, and it was, it was such a treat because everyone was doing so well. [[00:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3515.6200000000003s)]
*  Yeah, I was, I was stoked. [[00:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3519.94s)]

*  Can we go back one time? [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3524.5s)]
*  It'll be a slow-mo replay, I think. [[00:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3525.94s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3528.26s)]
*  Yeah, look how stoked you are. [[00:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3529.3s)]
*  You gotta carry your own bike down? [[00:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3531.7000000000003s)]
*  What do you think someone's gonna run up and just bring it down? [[00:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3533.78s)]
*  Yeah, at that point, yeah. [[00:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3535.7000000000003s)]
*  Some sort of concierge, yeah, you can see. [[00:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3537.38s)]
*  So you've never done that before? [[00:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3540.1800000000003s)]
*  No. [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3541.38s)]
*  And what made you do that? [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3541.46s)]
*  Can we just pause it right there? [[00:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3542.7400000000002s)]
*  I wanted to win the third in a row, dude. [[00:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3544.02s)]
*  Oh, so you're thinking what can I do that'll be different right now? [[00:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3545.7000000000003s)]
*  I need to do it. [[00:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3548.02s)]
*  They are not like, guys are doing tricks into it. [[00:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3548.6600000000003s)]
*  Morgan Wade, he like did a double tail whip into it and like guys are 360'ing into it. [[00:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3551.2200000000003s)]
*  So they were stepping it up and I knew that I had to do something that like had never been done before [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3556.1000000000004s)]
*  to get the win. [[00:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3561.3s)]
*  They weren't gonna give it to me easily, so I was just like, I have to just do this. [[00:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3562.34s)]
*  Did you feel like you had extra pressure trying to get the win? [[00:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3565.7s)]
*  Like they were gonna judge you even more harsh because you already had two in a row? [[00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3568.18s)]
*  It's a little bit tougher to get the third one? [[00:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3571.38s)]
*  Yeah, I had to send it. [[00:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3573.38s)]
*  I wasn't holding back. [[00:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3575.3s)]
*  And I would have just done it anyway, even if I... [[00:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3576.42s)]
*  In the moment, it was for Dave Mirra. [[00:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3580.02s)]
*  So he passed away recently. [[00:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3582.82s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3585.38s)]
*  And he actually was the first guy I ever seen do a backflip drop in. [[00:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3585.62s)]
*  So I was like, when I'm at the top, I'm actually like, this is for you, Dave. [[00:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3590.02s)]
*  This is for you, Mirra, as I'm at the top. [[00:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3593.7000000000003s)]
*  And then I just hucked it, man. [[00:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3595.38s)]
*  And it was great. [[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3596.9s)]
*  Like, it's like moments like this. [[00:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3597.7000000000003s)]
*  The moments like this is the... [[00:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3599.62s)]
*  It just trips me out. [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3600.98s)]
*  And then I nearly rode off the side of the ramp going... [[01:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3602.1s)]
*  Like this is obviously one of my signature tricks that I brought from the scooter world, right? [[01:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3604.66s)]
*  So there you go. [[01:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3609.86s)]
*  And what's that trick called? [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3610.5s)]
*  That's called a nothing front bike flip. [[01:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3611.38s)]
*  Of course it is. [[01:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3612.9s)]
*  Or a two-way twist. [[01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3615.14s)]
*  They've had an inside joke on two of that. [[01:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3616.66s)]
*  And then here, so you lean that energy forward kind of, but not all the way forward. [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3618.42s)]
*  No, I have to be really light though. [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3622.26s)]
*  Right. [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3623.86s)]
*  Because that ramp's 27 and a half foot tall. [[01:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3624.1800000000003s)]
*  So it's like if you come off at all, like you are hurting yourself real bad. [[01:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3626.58s)]
*  Yeah, so it's a trick, man. [[01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3632.42s)]
*  So what and where do they measure the ramps from? [[01:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3636.1s)]
*  Where do they measure that 27 feet? [[01:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3640.02s)]
*  Where do they start that measurement? [[01:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3641.62s)]
*  So from where it starts to go up. [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3642.58s)]
*  So from the bottom of the ramp to the coping, which is the metal part [[01:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3644.42s)]
*  across, that's like 27 and a half foot. [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3648.18s)]
*  And I think it's like there's some two foot avert or something. [[01:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3650.5s)]
*  So avert is just straight up. [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3653.22s)]
*  Okay. [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3654.74s)]
*  And so when you get to like the peak of the ramp, right? [[01:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3655.7s)]
*  You have to be careful not to drift forward. [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3662.02s)]
*  Well, literally, oh, you don't, yeah, you don't want to go forward. [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3664.2599999999998s)]
*  It's harder to go into the ramp than it is. [[01:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3666.8199999999997s)]
*  It's easy to come out. [[01:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3669.22s)]
*  Like the thing is, that's the scariest part about that ramp is you're going so fast that [[01:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3670.1s)]
*  literally if I went like this, if I went like that, I would go 16. [[01:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3675.62s)]
*  I would go so far at the flat that I would break my legs. [[01:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3680.9s)]
*  Jesus. [[01:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3683.54s)]
*  So that's why in that moment, man, I am like, that is the most wide I've ever been in my life [[01:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3685.46s)]
*  is when I'm doing that. [[01:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3691.06s)]
*  I'm like, if I don't do the right thing right now, I'm going to get really, really hurt. [[01:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3691.94s)]
*  Okay. [[01:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3697.54s)]
*  So you're going up, you're heading up the ramp. [[01:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3697.8599999999997s)]
*  What is the right thing at that point? [[01:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3699.94s)]
*  Like what's the right amount of? [[01:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3701.46s)]
*  So I'll go up. [[01:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3702.98s)]
*  It's just, it's kind of like, it's like the riding with your eyes closed. [[01:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3704.18s)]
*  You get built, it gets built into you. [[01:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3708.98s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3710.58s)]
*  Like I know that this will do this. [[01:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3710.9s)]
*  Right. [[01:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3714.02s)]
*  So it's like, I remember I just, I remembered that I'd done, I'd landed the, that trick before [[01:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3714.26s)]
*  the front flip one. [[01:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3719.22s)]
*  So I knew, okay, this is what I have to do. [[01:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3720.7400000000002s)]
*  I'm going really fast, but I just got to like chill. [[01:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3722.82s)]
*  It's almost like I just float off the ramp. [[01:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3726.82s)]
*  So I rode up and I just got to like, I don't, I don't know. [[01:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3729.06s)]
*  I don't want to initiate. [[01:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3732.66s)]
*  It's not like the triple front flip total opposite. [[01:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3734.02s)]
*  Right. [[01:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3735.7799999999997s)]
*  You're not trying to just initiate a lot of energy. [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3736.1s)]
*  I'm like this, like literally I'll pretend I'm doing it right now. [[01:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3738.58s)]
*  I'm going up and I'll go like this, like that, like that much. [[01:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3741.62s)]
*  And then you just, and then you just hold on, baby. [[01:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3747.46s)]
*  You're on the roller coaster with no, you're not strapped in. [[01:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3750.5s)]
*  Is your eyes open or not? [[01:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3752.9s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3754.5s)]
*  Eyes are wide open, but you don't see at the start. [[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3754.74s)]
*  It's kind of blind because I'm looking at the sky, you know, I'm not looking at the ground. [[01:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3757.7s)]
*  And then I'll be looking at the ground. [[01:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3761.14s)]
*  That's kind of the scariest part of that trick. [[01:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3762.2599999999998s)]
*  Okay. [[01:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3763.7s)]
*  Is what? [[01:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3764.02s)]
*  Because for a second, for a second, I'm like, am I out? [[01:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3764.3399999999997s)]
*  Am I on top of the ramp or am I perfectly transitioned into coming in? [[01:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3768.8199999999997s)]
*  And I like, look, you can see, like I, so I go, and then I see I'm blind. [[01:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3773.06s)]
*  See, I'm like looking at, I was looking at the roof for a bit. [[01:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3777.22s)]
*  And then all of a sudden, as I'm coming down, I look, okay, now I'm coming in. [[01:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3779.7s)]
*  I'm not landing flat. [[01:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3784.2599999999998s)]
*  I'm not hitting the top of the ramp. [[01:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3785.54s)]
*  I'm coming in smooth. [[01:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3786.98s)]
*  That would be such the fear. [[01:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3788.2599999999998s)]
*  That's the moment when you're like, I'm going to land it. [[01:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3789.7s)]
*  Sweet. [[01:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3791.7s)]
*  Wow. [[01:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3792.3399999999997s)]
*  Because I've already played it through the simulator, right? [[01:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3793.7s)]
*  And I'm like, this is what I'm expecting to see. [[01:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3796.1s)]
*  And then that moment I seen that. [[01:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3798.66s)]
*  There we go. [[01:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3801.46s)]
*  Let's roll away. [[01:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3802.1s)]
*  Damn, bro. [[01:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3803.14s)]
*  That's fire. [[01:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3804.3399999999997s)]
*  Wow. [[01:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3806.66s)]
*  I wish I knew how to do something like that. [[01:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3807.7s)]
*  Well, whenever I come to Queensland, dude, I'm gonna have to go to our Willie, [[01:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3811.2999999999997s)]
*  to our Willie land. [[01:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3815.46s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3816.4199999999996s)]
*  And go on and do something. [[01:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3816.98s)]
*  Do the trike. [[01:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3819.22s)]
*  I'll keep the trike spare for you. [[01:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3820.4199999999996s)]
*  My mom's trike. [[01:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3821.9399999999996s)]
*  No, I need something better than that. [[01:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3823.06s)]
*  Oh yeah? [[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3824.18s)]
*  Okay. [[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3824.58s)]
*  I think so, dude. [[01:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3825.06s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3825.9399999999996s)]
*  Wait, look. [[01:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3826.1s)]
*  The trike, look, all respect to your mom. [[01:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3827.22s)]
*  All respect to Donna, man. [[01:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3829.9399999999996s)]
*  She obviously has done her work, but I think what's next up from a trikey thing? [[01:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3831.14s)]
*  A BMX bike. [[01:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3839.8599999999997s)]
*  Could someone handle that or not? [[01:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3840.8199999999997s)]
*  Is that pretty tricky? [[01:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3841.9399999999996s)]
*  Yeah, like a mountain bike is kind of pretty sturdy. [[01:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3842.2599999999998s)]
*  Okay. [[01:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3844.4199999999996s)]
*  And you just go off it, really? [[01:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3844.8999999999996s)]
*  Have you heard of bike? [[01:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3846.1s)]
*  That's what I was going to ask you. [[01:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3847.14s)]
*  Have you ever done an extreme sport? [[01:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3848.42s)]
*  Like skateboarding or anything like rolled around? [[01:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3851.38s)]
*  No, they didn't have a lot. [[01:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3854.58s)]
*  A lot of skateboarders, boss, just really were just doing drugs. [[01:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3855.46s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3858.34s)]
*  They owned the boards, but they was mostly just for setting their drugs on while they [[01:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3858.66s)]
*  were rolling them up. [[01:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3862.5s)]
*  But we didn't have a lot of, I'm trying to think if we had extreme sports, boss. [[01:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3864.1s)]
*  We had these guys that used to shoot these potato gun, like, [[01:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3868.66s)]
*  they had like a rest area, boss. [[01:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3872.1s)]
*  I don't think they have it on, and maybe in Australia, [[01:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3873.62s)]
*  your whole country is like a rest area actually, but it's like, [[01:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3876.02s)]
*  a rest area is like a place where you stop on the side of the interstate when you're driving. [[01:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3878.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3882.42s)]
*  And people like get out to use the restroom and drink water, change the baby, you know? [[01:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3882.9s)]
*  You usually have a cigarette and then get back in the van and keep going. [[01:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3888.66s)]
*  You know, sometimes beat the kids or whatever. [[01:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3892.58s)]
*  But if they've been bad. [[01:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3894.7400000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3896.02s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3896.26s)]
*  But not, but anyway, by us, there was a, there was one of those and behind it, they had a river. [[01:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3896.7400000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3903.38s)]
*  A lot of gay men would meet up at these places because it was like, [[01:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3903.62s)]
*  you know, it was like on the outskirts of town and stuff. [[01:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3906.74s)]
*  So gay men would meet up over there and, you know, do drugs and make out and stuff. [[01:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3910.02s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3915.46s)]
*  And across the river, that's where I lived. [[01:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3916.18s)]
*  So a lot of men over there, some of them would, not a lot, [[01:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3920.02s)]
*  but they had these two guys that would make like potato, these potato gun launchers. [[01:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3922.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3925.7799999999997s)]
*  And if like a lot of like, like real high men were making out or something, [[01:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3926.02s)]
*  they would shoot potatoes over near them. [[01:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3929.7799999999997s)]
*  Oh, no way. [[01:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3931.3799999999997s)]
*  Pretty messed up. [[01:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3932.18s)]
*  I mean, they weren't trying to endanger them or anything. [[01:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3932.8999999999996s)]
*  I think they just didn't want to. [[01:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3935.14s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3936.9s)]
*  I think they just didn't want them doing a lot of drugs and making out in the water. [[01:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3937.14s)]
*  They didn't want anybody to drown because some men had drowned. [[01:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3940.1s)]
*  Oh, okay. [[01:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3942.42s)]
*  So it was almost like lifeguarding a little bit, but, [[01:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3942.9s)]
*  but that was like the most extreme part I ever saw was people with these potato guns, you know? [[01:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3945.62s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3949.3s)]
*  I think anyway. [[01:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3950.66s)]
*  You rode a bike? [[01:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3951.78s)]
*  Yeah, I rode a bike. [[01:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3952.98s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3953.86s)]
*  But I never really thought much of it. [[01:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3954.42s)]
*  We used to build the ramp, you know, somebody always like the ramp, [[01:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3956.34s)]
*  like was a poorly built and this part would come out and then somebody, [[01:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3959.46s)]
*  the handlebar would turn and went into some guy's body one time. [[01:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3962.9s)]
*  I remember. [[01:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3965.54s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3966.34s)]
*  But pretty shit. [[01:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3966.98s)]
*  We were pretty, pretty shit ex-gamers. [[01:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3967.7799999999997s)]
*  Oh, well, that's right. [[01:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3970.58s)]
*  But I think I could probably get out there. [[01:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3972.2599999999998s)]
*  I would love to get out there and try. [[01:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3973.94s)]
*  That would be sick. [[01:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3975.14s)]
*  I could teach you like safely to do it too. [[01:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3976.9s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3979.06s)]
*  So we could get you flying. [[01:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3979.38s)]
*  Yeah, I think I'd be willing to. [[01:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3980.58s)]
*  So what is like, what is the future of this whole sport kind of look like? [[01:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3983.22s)]
*  Like, what's, what is a mechanism like not the bike or the scooter? [[01:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3986.82s)]
*  What's something that came out that people thought was going to be like the next [[01:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3992.1800000000003s)]
*  thing that people were going to use for tricks that kind of didn't make it? [[01:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3996.02s)]
*  Was there, have there been different things? [[01:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=3998.9s)]
*  Roll blades kind of died off now. [[01:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=4000.7400000000002s)]
*  Like roll blades are like pretty big. [[01:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=4002.98s)]
*  Back when I started doing it, it was kind of like still around and still in the ex-games, [[01:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=4005.5400000000004s)]
*  but then roll bling just dropped off a fair bit. [[01:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=4008.98s)]
*  But there's still insane dudes doing the roll blades. [[01:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=4011.1400000000003s)]
*  Maybe like a rip stick. [[01:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=4014.26s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=4015.5400000000004s)]
*  Like that's kind of like, you know what a rip stick is? [[01:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=4016.1000000000004s)]
*  The one where people go like this to get speed. [[01:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=4018.26s)]
*  It's like one wheel and it goes like that. [[01:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=4020.74s)]
*  Let's see that. [[01:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=4022.58s)]
*  Can we pull that up? [[01:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=4023.14s)]
*  A rip stick. [[01:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=4023.7799999999997s)]
*  It's kind of like the weird. [[01:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=4024.58s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=4025.7s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[01:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=4026.8999999999996s)]
*  You seen that thing? [[01:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=4027.62s)]
*  I think I've seen this. [[01:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=4028.5s)]
*  I think that, I think that you might find this a bit like even worse than a roll blade. [[01:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=4029.4599999999996s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=4035.14s)]
*  I love it all. [[01:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=4036.4199999999996s)]
*  If you want to ride a rip stick, man, ride a rip stick. [[01:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=4037.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=4041.4599999999996s)]
*  Actually, it looks pretty fun, actually. [[01:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=4043.3799999999997s)]
*  I think, yeah, I'm trying to think. [[01:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=4047.06s)]
*  We had like a roll, a place called Roller Kingdom Bus where we'd have all our birthday parties. [[01:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=4050.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=4054.02s)]
*  And dude, this one kid, this kid Jeremy, who we're buddies with at the birthday parties, [[01:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=4054.74s)]
*  he would go and get all the gum from like under the tables and make a huge like, [[01:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=4060.8999999999996s)]
*  and by the end of the birthday party, he would be chewing the biggest gum, dude. [[01:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=4065.7799999999997s)]
*  He was twisted, bro. [[01:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=4069.14s)]
*  That's crazy. [[01:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=4070.74s)]
*  Oh, he was so twisted, dude. [[01:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=4071.62s)]
*  He did it every fucking time, bro. [[01:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=4073.22s)]
*  He just had this ultimate thing of gum, dude. [[01:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=4075.7799999999997s)]
*  And nobody would even, his parents, I guess, weren't paying attention to him because [[01:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=4078.8199999999997s)]
*  when they came to pick him, they wouldn't even ask him. [[01:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=4082.98s)]
*  He couldn't even open his mouth when he had so much fucking gum. [[01:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=4085.22s)]
*  He just breathed through his nose and his mom's like, you're doing great, Jeremy. [[01:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=4088.66s)]
*  You know? [[01:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=4093.14s)]
*  So fucking, that's an X game right there. [[01:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=4094.2599999999998s)]
*  Yeah, that's pretty extreme. [[01:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=4097.0599999999995s)]
*  Yeah. So that's the kind of extreme sports that we had, I feel like. [[01:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=4098.18s)]
*  A bit more like that. [[01:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=4102.099999999999s)]
*  Um, was there, was there, what about that with the motorized thing that I see with the [[01:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=4103.46s)]

*  I think they like run off. [[01:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=4209.62s)]
*  It's like that free running, you know? [[01:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=4211.219999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=4213.0599999999995s)]
*  Parkour. [[01:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=4213.54s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=4214.339999999999s)]
*  And that's that never really took off. [[01:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=4214.58s)]
*  But people still do it and that's just kind of like just running around. [[01:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=4216.42s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=4219.78s)]
*  Like it's like practicing running away from like. [[01:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=4220.34s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=4223.62s)]
*  It's like, yeah, like I'm going to trick the cops or something or like it's almost like athletic. [[01:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=4223.78s)]
*  A lot of parkour people I think are athletic. [[01:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=4229.46s)]
*  Graffiti. [[01:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=4233.54s)]
*  It's like, it's like a little, it seems like a side, like a. [[01:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=4234.26s)]
*  A side hustle. [[01:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=4237.78s)]
*  Yeah. For, for graffiti people. [[01:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=4238.58s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=4240.18s)]
*  Like I'm going to paint this later, but watch first. [[01:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=4241.86s)]
*  I'm going to run, you know, I'm going to run around. [[01:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=4243.46s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=4245.22s)]
*  I feel like. [[01:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=4246.42s)]
*  That could actually be pretty cool if that free running incorporated with graffiti, [[01:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=4247.14s)]
*  like they do graffiti on the run. [[01:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=4250.34s)]
*  Yeah. I wonder if there's a way where that they, as they went up, like say they go up a ramp, [[01:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=4253.700000000001s)]
*  right? Or a vert, what is that called? [[01:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=4257.9400000000005s)]
*  It's a ramp. [[01:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=4259.780000000001s)]
*  A ramp. [[01:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=4260.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=4260.9800000000005s)]
*  So then if they had a wall while they're up there and like each time they went up, [[01:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=4261.54s)]
*  they had to paint something. [[01:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=4264.5s)]
*  And then by the end of like, you know, after six times of going up, [[01:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=4265.38s)]
*  then they had like a piece of art up there. [[01:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=4268.580000000001s)]
*  I'm just trying to think, do you see something as being like the next thing? [[01:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=4271.38s)]
*  Cause something always kind of comes along. [[01:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=4274.42s)]
*  Like you're saying it's like, you know, a new mode of transportation comes along. [[01:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=4275.78s)]
*  And then that's what. [[01:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=4280.9s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=4283.62s)]
*  Um, like the things that are unicycle is there unicycling? [[01:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=4284.1s)]
*  Yeah. People literally do tricks on that. [[01:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=4286.82s)]
*  I think it's crazy. [[01:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=4288.5s)]
*  These days, anything can just become something, you know, it's like. [[01:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=4290.02s)]

*  You know, it's just like the niche, it's just something happens and then it just sticks. [[01:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=4298.26s)]
*  They just don't shit at the wall and then just sticks and like, Oh, everyone's like, [[01:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=4303.3s)]
*  fuck, I want to throw shit at that shit at the wall too. [[01:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=4306.82s)]

*  wow, that like really matters. [[01:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=4397.299999999999s)]
*  Like you're a doctor that like really, really helps someone. [[01:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=4398.339999999999s)]
*  And then sometimes I'm like, well, I'm just here just spinning around in circles and like, [[01:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=4401.139999999999s)]
*  people like to watch it, but like, what am I really bringing? [[01:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=4405.379999999999s)]
*  Sometimes that gets to me because I'm like, why am I risking it myself to just do these like [[01:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=4408.66s)]
*  stunts when like, what are they really achieving? [[01:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=4414.82s)]
*  But they do it like people are inspired by it to do anything. [[01:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=4417.62s)]
*  They might even just be inspired to like go harder in their life and whatever they're doing. [[01:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=4421.94s)]
*  So it's like, yeah. [[01:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=4425.94s)]
*  And I'm sure you see kids that remind you of yourself probably. [[01:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=4427.0599999999995s)]
*  Yeah, a hundred percent. [[01:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=4429.7s)]
*  And that's why I like am always pushing. [[01:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=4430.66s)]
*  And the craziest thing is like the tricks I'm doing, I was doing 10 years ago, [[01:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=4432.66s)]
*  everyone's doing now. [[01:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=4437.46s)]
*  Like, so it's like, I think the same way, like whatever I'm doing now, [[01:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=4438.26s)]
*  whatever I do to push the limits here today, [[01:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=4441.94s)]
*  that's just going to make action sports even crazier. [[01:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=4444.740000000001s)]
*  Like in the long run, you know, it's just going to level up action sports. [[01:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=4447.38s)]
*  So the harder I can go, the harder it's going to like the [[01:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=4450.740000000001s)]
*  crazier it's going to be in the future. [[01:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=4454.1s)]
*  I think. [[01:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=4455.46s)]
*  Is there a chance that you see sometimes you would see like that man drops in from [[01:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=4456.42s)]
*  outer space or something with the Red Bull stuff, you know, the guy, you know, Danny, [[01:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=4460.18s)]
*  whatever his name is, he jumps off of something and lands, you know, [[01:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=4464.1s)]
*  is there a way that you could do like a drop into a ramp, but from like an insanely high, [[01:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=4467.860000000001s)]
*  like off of a building and then still hit the like land it. [[01:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=4473.38s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=4478.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=4478.5s)]
*  Come in at a certain place on the ramp where you could still then go do something. [[01:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=4478.74s)]
*  Is something like that possible? [[01:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=4482.42s)]
*  That's crazy. [[01:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=4483.78s)]
*  Like I'd love to do something like that. [[01:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=4484.42s)]
*  I've always imagined like maybe doing a trick, like a world's first or something new [[01:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=4486.34s)]
*  across two buildings or something like that. [[01:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=4489.7s)]
*  But Robbie Madison is a guy that did, he jumped onto the luge, I think, or something. [[01:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=4491.3s)]
*  Like, I think it was just the one in Vegas though. [[01:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=4496.5s)]
*  Like the, it's like the building with the archway, he like jumped up it and then turned [[01:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=4498.1s)]
*  around and then jumped off into a ramp. [[01:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=4502.82s)]
*  Wow. [[01:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=4505.139999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=4505.62s)]
*  Robbie Madison. [[01:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=4505.86s)]
*  So did he really? [[01:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=4506.58s)]
*  Can we look at that real quick? [[01:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=4507.78s)]
*  Do you? [[01:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=4508.82s)]
*  Yeah, it was wild. [[01:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=4510.66s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=4514.58s)]
*  It's like, and are there a lot of, I feel like there'd be a lot of Vietnamese kids doing this. [[01:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=4515.139999999999s)]
*  Is there like a lot of Asian kids that do this sport? [[01:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=4519.299999999999s)]
*  Do you notice? [[01:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=4521.139999999999s)]
*  BMX is popping off in Japan because they just had the Olympics and this like Logan [[01:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=4521.86s)]
*  shout out to Logan Martin. [[01:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=4527.78s)]
*  He won the Olympic gold medal, the first ever BMX Olympic gold medal. [[01:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=4528.66s)]
*  Oh, cause it was the first time they ever had BMX in the thing. [[01:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=4532.58s)]
*  First time they had BMX, first time they had skateboarding. [[01:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=4534.5s)]
*  Yeah, this is it. [[01:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=4536.34s)]
*  So he jumps up, right? [[01:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=4539.94s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=4542.0199999999995s)]
*  Which is gnarly, so gnarly. [[01:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=4542.42s)]
*  And then he turns around and he almost goes too far. [[01:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=4544.5s)]
*  There's his, hopefully it's his girl. [[01:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=4547.7s)]
*  Yeah, tripping out. [[01:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=4549.62s)]
*  If not, it's somebody who definitely is going to try and get child support out of him, [[01:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=4551.22s)]
*  that's for sure. [[01:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=4555.14s)]
*  Just make it in the video. [[01:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=4556.58s)]
*  Wow, can you imagine looking down from here, bro? [[01:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=4558.0199999999995s)]
*  Look at that. [[01:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=4561.14s)]
*  Oh my God, that makes my freaking penis just go inside of my body, dog. [[01:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=4562.18s)]
*  Dude, that's funny that you say that. [[01:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=4566.820000000001s)]
*  Sometimes I'm riding, if I'm really concentrating, I can feel like my dick shrinking. [[01:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=4569.14s)]
*  Oh, yeah, cool, bro. [[01:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=4573.54s)]
*  I think it's like a defense mechanism. [[01:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=4576.5s)]
*  Oh yeah, your dick's like, you might be doing this, I'm not. [[01:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=4578.18s)]
*  Oh yeah, they got her really, really scared. [[01:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=4582.18s)]
*  They got, oh, he's up there looming. [[01:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=4585.14s)]
*  Yeah, you feel like he's totally confident at this point and he's just kind of, this is for sure. [[01:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=4587.14s)]
*  I mean, he's just got to do it. [[01:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=4590.9s)]
*  You got to be confident. [[01:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=4592.5s)]
*  If you're not confident, it's like, that's where it's going to go wrong. [[01:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=4593.379999999999s)]
*  You have to have 100% belief in yourself. [[01:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=4596.42s)]
*  Jesus, I could never do that. [[01:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=4599.139999999999s)]
*  I've never done that in my whole life, dude. [[01:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=4601.86s)]
*  Yeah, he's got it. [[01:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=4606.099999999999s)]
*  He goes too far too, he nearly dies. [[01:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=4607.219999999999s)]
*  Ooh. [[01:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=4611.219999999999s)]
*  Yeah, you see? [[01:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=4611.86s)]
*  Like, just catching the very bottom. [[01:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=4613.46s)]
*  Bro, that was lucky, that was really close. [[01:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=4618.179999999999s)]
*  Do you think he made it that close on purpose or not? [[01:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=4620.82s)]
*  No, that was, he did not want to do that. [[01:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=4623.38s)]
*  He didn't want to go far because like, if he went a meter more. [[01:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=4626.179999999999s)]
*  Oh yeah, that's bad news bears. [[01:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=4630.42s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=4632.0199999999995s)]
*  Like you're saying you got to come in where there's enough of that gradient. [[01:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=4633.0599999999995s)]
*  If you don't catch the transition, then you're pancaking. [[01:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=4635.78s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=4641.54s)]
*  Do you feel pretty proud of yourself a lot of times? [[01:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=4642.259999999999s)]
*  Are you able to feel that kind of stuff? [[01:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=4644.0199999999995s)]
*  Yeah, when I achieve something that I've really wanted to do for a long time, [[01:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=4646.26s)]
*  I'll feel that. [[01:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=4651.860000000001s)]
*  But that's just like, that's one problem that I have is just, it's like onto the next. [[01:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=4652.5s)]
*  It's like, it's hard to sit and smell the roses when you just, I'm just so passionate about it. [[01:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=4656.5s)]
*  And it's like, why stop when I don't have to, or when I am able to just keep going. [[01:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=4660.9800000000005s)]
*  Just, it's hard for me to sit back and go, whoa, sick, I'm rad. [[01:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=4665.06s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[01:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=4669.7s)]
*  Yeah, and maybe because I think at some point, in some ways there's not a ton of value in it. [[01:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=4671.38s)]
*  I think there's value in having appreciation for what you're doing and recognizing it. [[01:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=4675.46s)]
*  But yeah, to sit there and just smell the roses, you got to keep watering them too. [[01:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=4680.5s)]
*  So it's like, I'll just always find that kind of interesting. [[01:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=4684.26s)]
*  Is there a trick or something you have your eyes kind of set on? [[01:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=4688.740000000001s)]
*  Is there like a new template or a new mode or something that you see yourself maybe being able [[01:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=4690.820000000001s)]
*  to, like a new type of ramp? [[01:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=4699.3s)]
*  Is there things that you think of sometimes that you? [[01:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=4702.42s)]
*  Well, obviously it'd be so cool to do something like that, like something out there and just [[01:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=4705.54s)]
*  different, not just a new variation of a trick, you know? [[01:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=4709.7s)]
*  But there's tricks that I have that I, on my trick list that I want to do that are like [[01:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=4712.82s)]
*  going to be that really next level. [[01:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=4717.9400000000005s)]
*  Like I want to do, I really want to do a triple backflip 360. [[01:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=4719.86s)]
*  So like, so three flips with a spin in it. [[01:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=4723.54s)]
*  Now when, okay, so say you're doing that, when do you start to incorporate the spin? [[01:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=4728.1s)]
*  So about, I wouldn't nearly do it at the very start, but it's going to be, so I would do [[01:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=4732.1s)]
*  like a flip with a 180 turn and then a flip with a 180 turn. [[01:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=4736.740000000001s)]
*  And then the last one would just be straight. [[01:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=4742.02s)]
*  Ah, I see. [[01:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=4744.26s)]
*  So you would do a flip and a one and then flip one and then just straight. [[01:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=4745.3s)]
*  Ah, interesting. [[01:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=4749.06s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=4750.660000000001s)]
*  When you guys go out on some of these tours, is the party in pretty good? [[01:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=4751.700000000001s)]
*  Who parties better? [[01:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=4754.9800000000005s)]
*  Like people on the on the Nitro Circus tour or Australians in general, do you think? [[01:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=4755.780000000001s)]
*  Probably, I mean, Australians party so hard, but I feel like every other party is pretty hard. [[01:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=4762.740000000001s)]
*  Like America, these get pretty wild. [[01:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=4767.14s)]
*  Like you reach a point where he's just going like go mad. [[01:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=4769.3s)]
*  But I think on tour it's so insane because we're all like super passionate, you know, [[01:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=4772.02s)]
*  it's, it's everyone is like at the pinnacle of their sport, action sports. [[01:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=4777.3s)]
*  So they're like, you know, they're like the boss skate. [[01:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=4780.740000000001s)]
*  Like if you went to a skate park, there's that one kid that's like, like insane. [[01:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=4783.46s)]
*  And then like if you handpick like the best ones, join them into a group. [[01:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=4787.780000000001s)]
*  Like a circus. [[01:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=4792.26s)]
*  And that's what you get. [[01:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=4793.540000000001s)]
*  Like we all are like kind of ADHD, I guess. [[01:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=4794.26s)]
*  Well, and we're all just super passionate. [[01:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=4797.540000000001s)]
*  So, so is there a lot of parting as much as, or do you hear stories that there used to be [[01:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=4799.14s)]
*  more parting? [[01:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=4802.660000000001s)]
*  Because with comedy, you always hear stories like people were doing cocaine right here. [[01:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=4803.06s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=4806.740000000001s)]
*  Now people are doing their taxes. [[01:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=4806.9800000000005s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[01:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=4808.5s)]
*  It's just like gotten hella fucking lame, dude. [[01:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=4808.9800000000005s)]
*  Yeah, it's, it's changed a lot for us too, because I'm the youngest on tour. [[01:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=4811.22s)]
*  So, and I'm 27. [[01:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=4815.38s)]
*  So it, and it used to be like everyone else's 20s, like in their 20s, [[01:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=4816.5s)]
*  in their 30s, but now they all have families and like kids. [[01:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=4822.0199999999995s)]
*  So it's like mellowed out a lot. [[01:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=4824.9s)]
*  But in a way that's a good thing and a bad thing because we're all like smarter, wiser, [[01:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=4826.74s)]
*  doing, making the right decisions. [[01:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=4831.86s)]
*  You know, you're not getting drunk and then potentially like riding the next day, [[01:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=4833.299999999999s)]
*  hungover and hurting yourself. [[01:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=4837.78s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=4839.139999999999s)]
*  But there's guys on tour that literally will just drink into oblivion and then wake up and [[01:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=4839.46s)]
*  just triple backflip. [[01:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=4844.42s)]
*  And like, like it's nothing like the, you have the rockstar dudes still doing that. [[01:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=4845.7s)]
*  And at moments that's the rockstar is still there. [[01:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=4849.54s)]
*  Like a few drinks in, everyone's kind of a rockstar again. [[01:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=4853.7s)]
*  Is that your vibe really or no? [[01:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=4856.98s)]
*  Yeah. Yes and no. [[01:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=4858.74s)]
*  Like I definitely love to have fun, go out and like party. [[01:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=4860.5s)]
*  And I had a few drinks at the Laugh Factory last night, but it would have been weird for me to [[01:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=4863.62s)]
*  like go party and then go do a show because I, I have a younger following too. [[01:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=4867.78s)]
*  And I want to be a hundred percent. [[01:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=4872.26s)]
*  Like when I do a show, I feel like a lot of people, I'm representing Scootering. [[01:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=4874.0199999999995s)]
*  I'm representing action sports to families and kids. [[01:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=4878.1s)]
*  Just the term I'm representing Scootering is so insane. [[01:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=4881.22s)]
*  It's so great though, man. [[01:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=4885.54s)]
*  It's so great to think of something that yeah, you'd see some like, yeah, you see some kid on [[01:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=4887.22s)]
*  and you're like, ah, fuck this kid, you know, 10 years ago. [[01:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=4891.46s)]
*  Well, that's it. [[01:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=4894.26s)]
*  But then now I'm sitting here enamored by this kid, you know? [[01:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=4895.14s)]
*  So it's really interesting, man. [[01:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=4898.1s)]
*  That was like my goal ever since the start, man. [[01:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=4899.700000000001s)]
*  I was like, what can I do? [[01:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=4901.860000000001s)]
*  Like Scootering literally gave me my life, like this amazing life. [[01:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=4903.620000000001s)]
*  I'll give my life to Scootering. [[01:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=4907.62s)]
*  Like what could I do to stop that kid at the skate park getting grief like I did? [[01:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=4908.9800000000005s)]
*  So he can just enjoy it, you know, and just even though it was probably a good thing for me. [[01:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=4916.1s)]
*  That's the thing that's always wonder. [[01:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=4920.5s)]
*  It's like we all, we want to stop all the bullying, but fuck dude. [[01:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=4922.02s)]
*  If I didn't get bullied, dude, I would not. [[01:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=4925.22s)]
*  That's how you even get any. [[01:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=4928.9800000000005s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=4931.3s)]
*  So it's interesting, but I know what you're saying. [[01:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=4931.62s)]
*  You want them to know that there's an outlet you want to be available for. [[01:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=4933.3s)]
*  Inspiration and they're always everyone's always it's always going to be there. [[01:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=4936.74s)]
*  Bullying is always going to be around. [[01:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=4939.94s)]
*  It's just, you just got to harden yourself. [[01:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=4941.3s)]
*  I got it so bad in school, like, and then I got it so bad at the skate park [[01:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=4943.3s)]
*  and it like almost built this hard shell around my body that it was like, I don't like. [[01:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=4947.94s)]
*  It bounces off me. [[01:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=4952.099999999999s)]
*  Right. [[01:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=4953.139999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=4953.7s)]

*  Oh dude, I'll drive any playground I drive by dude. [[01:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=4954.58s)]
*  If I'm by myself, I roll down the window and yell a damn little slur or something. [[01:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=4956.9s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[01:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=4960.179999999999s)]
*  It's to get somebody fired up. [[01:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=4960.66s)]

*  Hypothetically, not shitty and I shouldn't have said that man. [[01:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=4992.98s)]
*  That's kind of an offensive way to say it, but something that people would see. [[01:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=4995.86s)]
*  I couldn't see this being a mode to become amazing. [[01:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=5000.339999999999s)]

*  What is going on? [[01:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=5090.18s)]
*  The thing is this thing doesn't turn or twist. [[01:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=5092.9800000000005s)]
*  You can't like, you could only just spin it. [[01:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=5095.3s)]

*  Yeah, that looks pricey. [[01:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=5104.660000000001s)]
*  That looks like that's kind of cheating because you have the tricks built in. [[01:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=5106.26s)]
*  But I could see that becoming something. [[01:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=5109.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=5111.62s)]

*  They dropped off, I guess, because they were like, [[01:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=5117.9400000000005s)]
*  why do we have handlebars? [[01:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=5119.46s)]

*  Yeah. [[01:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=5122.02s)]
*  Like hover boards. [[01:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=5122.5s)]
*  Remember those came in for ages and then Mike Tyson got like dropped. [[01:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=5123.7s)]
*  Wait, is that the one that Justin was pushing? [[01:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=5127.14s)]
*  Probably. [[01:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=5129.78s)]
*  There was like a video of Mike Tyson on one. [[01:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=5130.820000000001s)]

*  You got it. [[01:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=5150.74s)]
*  Oh, I've never seen that. [[01:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=5153.06s)]
*  You know, your sport is one interesting thing that guys like, you know, [[01:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=5159.46s)]
*  I was doing this, you know, guys like. [[01:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=5163.54s)]
*  People can't just come into your sport and do it. [[01:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=5166.5s)]
*  Yeah, to a certain extent, that's why a lot of that's why scooters actually got [[01:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=5169.9400000000005s)]
*  grief from people because it's so accessible. [[01:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=5174.02s)]
*  Like you can, you could jump on a scooter right now. [[01:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=5177.7s)]
*  I could get you to the skate park. [[01:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=5179.9400000000005s)]
*  You could drop in like a kid can do it so easily. [[01:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=5181.3s)]
*  So it's just so accessible that like little kids just grab it and they go, [[01:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=5183.54s)]
*  you know, they have no direction. [[01:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=5188.58s)]
*  So they're at the skate park dropping in and just like getting in the way [[01:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=5190.34s)]
*  because they're just there by themselves. [[01:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=5193.46s)]
*  That's all they know. [[01:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=5194.74s)]
*  They don't know what to do. [[01:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=5196.26s)]
*  They don't know the rules. [[01:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=5197.14s)]
*  And that's kind of like where we get the bad rep is because it's so accessible [[01:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=5198.34s)]
*  and kids can just do it instantly and be in the road and not be like looking out [[01:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=5202.26s)]
*  having skate park etiquette. [[01:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=5206.18s)]
*  And that's kind of gave us a bad rap, but it's like, you can do the same thing. [[01:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=5207.78s)]
*  If, if a kid only had a skateboard and he would do the same thing, [[01:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=5211.38s)]
*  like just roll around, but it's super hard. [[01:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=5215.38s)]
*  It's not easy to just get a skateboard, skateboard and drop in. [[01:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=5217.22s)]
*  Like it takes you a few weeks to get comfortable to do something. [[01:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=5220.02s)]
*  And in those weeks, you get told by your friends, hey, don't do this. [[01:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=5223.78s)]
*  Don't do that. [[01:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=5227.3s)]
*  You got to wait for this person. [[01:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=5227.78s)]
*  It's like an intersection, you know? [[01:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=5229.219999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=5230.74s)]

*  Do you see yourself getting anything motorized? [[01:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=5233.3s)]
*  Do you ever feel like that vibe? [[01:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=5235.38s)]
*  Yeah, but it's just so dangerous, man. [[01:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=5237.139999999999s)]
*  I've flipped the motorbike that Travis, Travis Astranas, but it's gnarly, dude. [[01:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=5238.98s)]
*  They're so heavy and it's so wild. [[01:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=5244.099999999999s)]
*  I've seen, we just had last weekend, I'm at Bo Bamboo. [[01:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=5245.94s)]

*  Man, it sucks so bad. [[01:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=5484.26s)]

*  sense. [[01:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=5490.0199999999995s)]

*  That's the thing. [[01:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=5491.38s)]
*  When you're like blinded, when you don't you only see what's happening in the country. [[01:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=5492.179999999999s)]
*  You're like, oh, it's OK. [[01:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=5496.5s)]
*  We're all together. [[01:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=5497.54s)]
*  We're doing this together for a reason. [[01:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=5498.34s)]
*  Right. [[01:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=5500.66s)]
*  And then they're like, oh, America's so bad. [[01:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=5501.3s)]
*  There's so many cases. [[01:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=5503.22s)]
*  Just be careful over there. [[01:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=5505.22s)]
*  And then I literally got here. [[01:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=5506.66s)]
*  I got outside. [[01:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=5508.26s)]

*  Right. [[01:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=5510.74s)]
*  And it's like maybe they make you wear a mask like here and there, but I don't have to [[01:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=5511.06s)]
*  like, I don't have to quarantine for two weeks in a hotel room by myself to get into. [[01:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=5515.38s)]
*  That's crazy. [[01:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=5522.26s)]
*  Did you have to do that when you left? [[01:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=5523.46s)]
*  No. [[01:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=5525.14s)]
*  So I just had to get the test, right, to get on the plane. [[01:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=5525.46s)]

*  more than just totally normal. [[01:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=5577.780000000001s)]
*  And you're like, even coming to Los Angeles seems really, really. [[01:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=5579.22s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=5582.5s)]

*  Oh, yeah. [[01:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=5585.9400000000005s)]

*  Yeah. [[01:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=5589.22s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=5589.62s)]

*  It's actually funny because the motor ramp, we can't do that motor ramp indoors because [[01:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=5592.66s)]
*  they'll hit the roof. [[01:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=5596.900000000001s)]
*  Damn. [[01:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=5597.7s)]
*  Fuck. [[01:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=5599.06s)]
*  What's the highest ramp that's built right now for you guys to be able to use? [[01:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=5599.860000000001s)]
*  So the ramp that the guy did the quad backflip off, I think it's like 20 foot. [[01:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=5603.7s)]
*  Like that's to go forward. [[01:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=5608.42s)]
*  That's not like the air to come back down. [[01:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=5610.42s)]
*  It's like a quad flip ramp. [[01:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=5612.02s)]
*  What's the safest ramp that they can, you can technically use right now? [[01:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=5613.780000000001s)]
*  The one that we use on tour is about 16 foot off the ground. [[01:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=5618.82s)]
*  Could you, could they build a 30 foot ramp if you wanted or you wouldn't be able to get [[01:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=5622.099999999999s)]
*  to the top of it? [[01:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=5626.0199999999995s)]
*  You'd have to just go so fast, but they could do it. [[01:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=5626.74s)]
*  Like, and if someone wants to do five flips, that's how it goes. [[01:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=5629.219999999999s)]
*  Like if you want to do more things in the air, even though it sounds like crazier to [[01:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=5631.7s)]
*  have that bigger ramp, it's just going to give you that more time to like get the trick done. [[01:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=5637.54s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=5641.38s)]
*  Because it's like right now you just pushed for time in the air. [[01:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=5641.7s)]
*  Oh, I see. [[01:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=5645.78s)]
*  But yeah. [[01:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=5646.58s)]
*  So do you want more time up there? [[01:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=5647.06s)]
*  You think you do? [[01:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10o6ZNGwAyM&t=5648.26s)]
