*  There's nothing better than that. When somebody takes the Chrysler 300 and puts a Bentley logo [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmI7dGCEWqU&t=2623.12s)]
*  on it, those people come off insane. But I respect it. Oh, I respect that too. It's just like your, [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmI7dGCEWqU&t=2626.72s)]

*  starting to bubble up at first. I think I remembered, I'm trying to think if I remember [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmI7dGCEWqU&t=2681.52s)]
*  getting body hair, maybe a little on my chest, like in the crack of my chest. Yeah. Yeah. I got [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmI7dGCEWqU&t=2687.04s)]

*  something to flex a little. I grew up in kind of like a white and urban area. So you'd have, [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmI7dGCEWqU&t=2711.12s)]
*  dude, I remember they had a handicap dude, a black dude, and he was, his legs didn't work and they [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmI7dGCEWqU&t=2715.84s)]
*  braided his fucking legs around each other. Yeah, you should. Yeah. Yeah. You know, that's what I [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmI7dGCEWqU&t=2725.04s)]
*  would do. Or I put underglow on them. Oh, really? Like on the bottom so they shine a little? [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmI7dGCEWqU&t=2729.52s)]
*  Personally, yeah. Because then it looks like the Lord's carrying me, you know, right? I've never [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmI7dGCEWqU&t=2735.36s)]

*  they kind of pull up and let the wheels spin. Oh, yeah. You know, those dudes know what they're doing. [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmI7dGCEWqU&t=2764.48s)]
*  But again, yeah. But if I spent my life in a wheelchair, I'd get bored after a while. I [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmI7dGCEWqU&t=2768.56s)]
*  definitely want to. You think? I think so. I definitely want to learn the tricks. [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmI7dGCEWqU&t=2771.84s)]

*  How much things change and then how like we kind of don't take into account what other people [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmI7dGCEWqU&t=3466.8s)]
*  what their generation was like, you know, it's almost like you're there suddenly like wrong just [[00:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmI7dGCEWqU&t=3473.2799999999997s)]
*  because they're getting older or because like times have kind of changed, you know? Yeah. [[00:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmI7dGCEWqU&t=3477.7599999999998s)]
*  But anyway, what else can we talk about? That's a little more fucking normal, dude. What else is [[00:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmI7dGCEWqU&t=3485.04s)]
*  going on in the news? Zach, a lot of stuff, huh? Yeah, we got a couple of stories here. I guess a [[00:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmI7dGCEWqU&t=3489.2799999999997s)]
*  former bodyguard launching a ride sharing app where the drivers will be armed with guns. Oh, [[00:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmI7dGCEWqU&t=3494.8s)]
*  I heard about this in Atlanta, right? Yeah. I would use that, but I would go to a place where [[00:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmI7dGCEWqU&t=3499.12s)]
*  you wouldn't need bodyguard just to just feel cool. It's called Black Wolf. Black Wolf, an app [[00:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmI7dGCEWqU&t=3505.2799999999997s)]
*  designed to rival Uber and Lyft recently launched in Atlanta and is about to drop in New York. [[00:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmI7dGCEWqU&t=3510.48s)]
*  Kerry King Brown revealed he created the app as a necessary evil. Who are mostly on the news [[00:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmI7dGCEWqU&t=3515.8399999999997s)]
*  getting robbed, getting raped the average person. Well, yeah, who else is it going to be? Senators? [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmI7dGCEWqU&t=3520.64s)]
*  You could take down a senator pretty easy, though. But who else is going to be animal or something? [[00:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmI7dGCEWqU&t=3528.0s)]
*  Like who? Yeah, that's it. That is interesting. Like where would you take this? Like what's [[00:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmI7dGCEWqU&t=3532.08s)]
*  something you'd be going to like? Oh, yeah. Yeah. I mean, easily Memphis, dude. Shout out Memphis. [[00:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmI7dGCEWqU&t=3536.56s)]
*  A Raiders game. Raiders game. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I think that I think maybe like a Kid Rock cover [[00:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmI7dGCEWqU&t=3545.6800000000003s)]
*  band concert. Oh, yeah. You know, yeah, I could possibly see it needed for that, too. [[00:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmI7dGCEWqU&t=3553.04s)]
*  So what happened? They just send you with a driver with a gun because I think most Uber [[00:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmI7dGCEWqU&t=3559.12s)]
*  drivers, if you go to like Sacramento, probably just have a gun on them. Yeah. It seems like [[00:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmI7dGCEWqU&t=3563.04s)]
*  the drivers are specially trained. Like they mentioned that one of the drivers, a private [[00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmI7dGCEWqU&t=3568.32s)]
*  investigator and previously worked as a bodyguard. So it's not just they have the gun. It's like [[00:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmI7dGCEWqU&t=3571.7599999999998s)]
*  they're professionally trained protectors. OK, got it. So what I'm creating is a necessary evil. [[00:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmI7dGCEWqU&t=3575.68s)]
*  It's a necessity. It says Brown is no ordinary driver and he's no regular man with a plan. [[00:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmI7dGCEWqU&t=3580.56s)]
*  He is a private investigator and has worked as a bodyguard for celebrities and politicians. [[00:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmI7dGCEWqU&t=3586.48s)]
*  He wants to share his own brand of executive protection with the world. So this is one of [[00:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmI7dGCEWqU&t=3589.92s)]
*  those things I think you're starting to see. Like, you know, like this, there's too many [[00:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmI7dGCEWqU&t=3593.92s)]
*  insanely rich people out there. I think. Yeah. You know, walking around, right? I think there [[00:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmI7dGCEWqU&t=3599.12s)]
*  should be a cap on how much money that you can make. Then what you lose it and get back up. [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmI7dGCEWqU&t=3603.2s)]
*  Like if you overshoot in twenty one. Oh, yeah. No, but here's what happens. I think they then [[01:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmI7dGCEWqU&t=3609.04s)]
*  like sis, like the town or wherever you're from, let's you get something like named after you. [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmI7dGCEWqU&t=3614.96s)]
*  Like there's some like there's some value that's given to you because of the way you're creating [[01:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmI7dGCEWqU&t=3619.6s)]
*  stuff or you have to give more to your employee. Like, I don't know, something like. But I think [[01:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmI7dGCEWqU&t=3625.12s)]
*  part of it is like you're just starting to see like a lot of rich people are probably getting [[01:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmI7dGCEWqU&t=3630.72s)]
*  scared of people that are like shooting at them. What do you think? [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmI7dGCEWqU&t=3634.4s)]
*  I mean, yeah, that's a huge problem here in L.A. Like rich people getting robbed all the time. [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmI7dGCEWqU&t=3639.12s)]
*  Oh, yeah. We're like a Rolex on Rodeo runs up and grabs it. Yeah, that's the people going to get [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmI7dGCEWqU&t=3642.56s)]
*  this. It's not going to be he says it's for regular people. But what regular person is going to [[01:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmI7dGCEWqU&t=3647.6800000000003s)]
*  get that? Yeah. Unless they're going to prom or something, they don't want somebody else. [[01:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmI7dGCEWqU&t=3651.52s)]
*  It's funny hitting on their chick or something. Yeah, I don't I don't know when. [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmI7dGCEWqU&t=3654.56s)]

*  shooting over an air fryer. Yeah. So maybe I pull up with that there. [[01:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmI7dGCEWqU&t=3668.88s)]

*  that rich people are going to do. Yeah. Rich people who have a ton of extra expendable income, [[01:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmI7dGCEWqU&t=3677.2799999999997s)]
*  they just want to spend it anyway they can to look even richer. If you could hire somebody [[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmI7dGCEWqU&t=3682.88s)]
*  to be with you at all times, who would it be? Would it be like a bodyguard and escort? Maybe [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmI7dGCEWqU&t=3686.3199999999997s)]

*  that's almost different because you almost are kind of expecting it in that moment. I feel like at a [[01:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmI7dGCEWqU&t=4080.24s)]
*  stoplight, you're kind of looking around. I think for me, like there were cars in a parking lot. [[01:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmI7dGCEWqU&t=4083.6s)]
*  They were parked and what happened was I thought I walked up to, we had a rental car. I thought I [[01:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmI7dGCEWqU&t=4087.52s)]
*  would walk them to the room. I walked up to the wrong car, but I walked up and kind of like, [[01:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmI7dGCEWqU&t=4092.0s)]
*  was by, I mean, I'm like right by the glass. There's somebody sitting in that car. And I'm [[01:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmI7dGCEWqU&t=4097.599999999999s)]
*  like, if that person years ago would have been like, Oh, I'm so sorry. It's an accident. But now [[01:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmI7dGCEWqU&t=4101.12s)]
*  it's like, the windows are all tinted, everything. So it's like, I don't know. It just felt like if [[01:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmI7dGCEWqU&t=4105.92s)]
*  they shot me, it wouldn't be, it wouldn't be crazy. Yeah. Yeah. Like last words would be like, I get it. [[01:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmI7dGCEWqU&t=4110.48s)]
*  It does feel like the brain just trains you that anytime like somebody comes up to your car, you [[01:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmI7dGCEWqU&t=4116.24s)]
*  should be like, Oh, like, like fight or flight immediately. But everybody's scared now. I feel [[01:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmI7dGCEWqU&t=4120.0s)]
*  like, and we're building up this. But sometimes you go to like a real small town and they're like [[01:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmI7dGCEWqU&t=4124.24s)]
*  the opposite. Like you walk up, they're like, do you need some honey? I remember I was doing a show. [[01:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmI7dGCEWqU&t=4130.16s)]
*  That's a good point. I was in Butte, Montana, and there's a population of like 456, maybe 454 [[01:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmI7dGCEWqU&t=4133.92s)]
*  today. But that I was walking from the Walmart to my hotel and this lady drives by and she goes, [[01:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmI7dGCEWqU&t=4141.28s)]
*  do you need help? And I was like, and like, this is like very early in my career. So I thought I [[01:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmI7dGCEWqU&t=4147.44s)]
*  was like hot shit. And I was like, Oh, maybe she recognized me. And I was like, no, what's up? [[01:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmI7dGCEWqU&t=4151.04s)]
*  She's like, Oh, anytime you see somebody walking in this town, that means something, you know, [[01:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmI7dGCEWqU&t=4155.12s)]
*  something bad happened. And I was just helping you out. And that was that. No offers of sex or [[01:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmI7dGCEWqU&t=4158.4s)]
*  nothing. Yeah. Yeah. I think that's a good point. So I'm thinking from more like a city perspective. [[01:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmI7dGCEWqU&t=4163.36s)]
*  Where was this at? This was in Phoenix. Okay. Yeah. There's a lot of walking up cars out there. [[01:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmI7dGCEWqU&t=4168.48s)]

*  if I walk up somebody's car that they would, if they did shoot me or the, I just had never [[01:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmI7dGCEWqU&t=4179.36s)]
*  thought that there was that much fear in the air or like, uh, weird energy and like uncertainty. [[01:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmI7dGCEWqU&t=4184.160000000001s)]
*  I think people are just very nervous about what other people are capable of. Yeah, that is true. [[01:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmI7dGCEWqU&t=4189.92s)]
*  Everyone's just like on the heightened senses. Yeah. I think some of it's because you see a [[01:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmI7dGCEWqU&t=4195.360000000001s)]
*  lot of clips of people like beating people up on like Twitter and stuff. Do you ever see any of [[01:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmI7dGCEWqU&t=4199.120000000001s)]

*  Let's bring her up. I think, I think it was three tits and one eye. I wasn't really looking past [[01:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmI7dGCEWqU&t=4504.879999999999s)]
*  she only had two tits. Yeah, it was only two. No, she had three. Bro, you're thinking of total recall. [[01:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmI7dGCEWqU&t=4509.599999999999s)]
*  Yeah. I'm thinking of a good night. She just kind of does something. It's like the purple hair, [[01:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmI7dGCEWqU&t=4515.2s)]
*  like she, she would be a bartender at a place in Hollywood and wouldn't look at you. And that's [[01:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmI7dGCEWqU&t=4522.08s)]
*  hard to do with that eye, but she would like, she wouldn't look, you know, well having, oh yeah, [[01:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmI7dGCEWqU&t=4526.32s)]
*  I see what you're saying. But also I'm going to say this, having one eye, there will be something [[01:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmI7dGCEWqU&t=4531.12s)]
*  so nice if somebody, when I, you ever really try to look at somebody in the eyes? Just one. I'm [[01:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmI7dGCEWqU&t=4535.92s)]
*  doing it right now. Like, but in both eyes, it's almost impossible because you can't, you don't [[01:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmI7dGCEWqU&t=4540.24s)]
*  know where to. Yeah. You're, there's always a little bit of somebody told me a trick for like [[01:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmI7dGCEWqU&t=4544.08s)]
*  interviews. You stare in the middle of the nose, like the, like right in between the eyes, because [[01:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmI7dGCEWqU&t=4548.4s)]
*  it looks, you can't really tell. But also I think one eye is kind of seductive because like, imagine [[01:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmI7dGCEWqU&t=4553.12s)]
*  you do like one of these sort of cheek and she like blushes and like the one eye goes down. [[01:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmI7dGCEWqU&t=4557.92s)]
*  That's pretty hot. But that one eye is bigger. And imagine if she starts crying and one big [[01:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmI7dGCEWqU&t=4561.36s)]
*  tear comes out. Wow. I mean that could break an iPhone. You got to get a bowl of rice and everything. [[01:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmI7dGCEWqU&t=4566.16s)]
*  Who was your cartoon you'd go for? Let me think the cartoon that's, oh, Jessica rabbit, huh? [[01:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmI7dGCEWqU&t=4572.16s)]
*  Jessica rabbit does it for a lot of people. Yeah. Boy, I just wanted to draw my own dick on her. [[01:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmI7dGCEWqU&t=4577.2s)]
*  I remember when I saw that. Oh, what about a low? I thought she was a real woman. I was like, mom, [[01:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmI7dGCEWqU&t=4585.839999999999s)]

*  If you don't calm down, is that what happened? If you got too horned up, mom would beat you in the [[01:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmI7dGCEWqU&t=4594.48s)]
*  yard. Oh dude, my mom, if we were lucky, she'd get a can, she'd get some can beer and go sit in the [[01:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmI7dGCEWqU&t=4598.24s)]
*  yard for a while. Sometimes I wish somebody would beat my ass when I get too horny. It's something [[01:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmI7dGCEWqU&t=4604.08s)]
*  like if I start like swiping on dating apps, I wish somebody would just punch me in the back of [[01:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmI7dGCEWqU&t=4608.96s)]
*  your head and be like, go write a new joke. Are you right? Yeah, it'd be good. I'm thinking about [[01:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmI7dGCEWqU&t=4612.0s)]
*  that. Horniness slows down. It takes up so much of your time. Look at that. How much horniness [[01:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmI7dGCEWqU&t=4616.0s)]
*  does my therapist literally told me the other day that I should try jerking off to get these thoughts [[01:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmI7dGCEWqU&t=4621.44s)]

*  Because I was like, I was like, I feel like sometimes I like I'm going on dates. I don't [[01:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmI7dGCEWqU&t=4631.36s)]
*  know if I just like the attention. Do I do I like, I don't want to waste anybody's time. [[01:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmI7dGCEWqU&t=4634.64s)]
*  But do I like these people or is it just the attention? And he's like, well, before you like, [[01:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmI7dGCEWqU&t=4638.72s)]
*  start texting people back, like just jerk off. And it was like such a simple, it's the only time [[01:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmI7dGCEWqU&t=4641.92s)]

*  you feel? Why doesn't make you feel? But this is the only time he's like, just touch yourself. And [[01:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmI7dGCEWqU&t=4650.56s)]

*  So you got that half life. So you see, you're, you come right back around pretty quick. [[01:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmI7dGCEWqU&t=4660.0s)]
*  When you make love to a woman, are you willing or able to make love again the same night? [[01:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmI7dGCEWqU&t=4664.88s)]

*  it doesn't matter what, if I don't know the answers today, that's fine. And then I can like [[01:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmI7dGCEWqU&t=6363.36s)]
*  walk myself through it, but it starts off high. Then I like walk myself through it. Yeah. And then [[01:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmI7dGCEWqU&t=6367.36s)]
*  I saw that moth go straight into that fire. I was thinking about this last night. Actually, [[01:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmI7dGCEWqU&t=6371.2s)]
*  I saw a moth go right into the fire. I was like, damn, maybe that's, I don't know. Everybody has [[01:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmI7dGCEWqU&t=6374.24s)]
*  their own journey. Whoa, whoa, brother. That moth was not feeling it, but yeah, I don't know. I, [[01:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmI7dGCEWqU&t=6379.52s)]
*  I think that's, I usually feel that then I can walk myself through it. And I go, that's fine. [[01:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmI7dGCEWqU&t=6385.360000000001s)]
*  Well, it can keep going. That's the thing. If you don't get an idea of what you want to do, [[01:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmI7dGCEWqU&t=6390.4800000000005s)]

*  it just can't shut the brain off. I'm the same way. And I'm so, so thankful that I knew what I [[01:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmI7dGCEWqU&t=6403.52s)]
*  wanted to do at a young age. Like the fact that I'm more lost in life than I am with career. [[01:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmI7dGCEWqU&t=6408.96s)]
*  It's a blessing. Cause the other way can, can be just, it's just a different way, but it's [[01:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmI7dGCEWqU&t=6415.12s)]
*  gonna be tough. It's always greener. It's like you have the perfect family relationship, but you're [[01:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmI7dGCEWqU&t=6418.8s)]

*  You just take it day by day. Oh yeah, dude. I think sometimes bro. But I notice if you don't [[01:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmI7dGCEWqU&t=6436.32s)]
*  have an idea or get an idea at some point, you'll just continue. Like I just continue to work. My [[01:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmI7dGCEWqU&t=6441.84s)]
*  life continues to be kind of the same cycle. Some of it is because like, uh, like just being late [[01:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmI7dGCEWqU&t=6445.759999999999s)]
*  to figuring out what's going on with myself. You know, whereas now as I do start to look a bit, [[01:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmI7dGCEWqU&t=6452.4s)]
*  a little bit more like I want a family or I'm alone by myself. And it's like, man, after a [[01:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmI7dGCEWqU&t=6456.48s)]
*  while this gets boring, right? You know, or, uh, you want to have somebody to share like a nice time [[01:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmI7dGCEWqU&t=6459.759999999999s)]

*  there's no perfect way. There isn't. And that's what I think you find out just in time. You just [[01:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmI7dGCEWqU&t=6472.56s)]
*  find out what you like and what you don't like. And you try to tend to what you like as much as [[01:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmI7dGCEWqU&t=6476.88s)]
*  you can. Yeah. Do you think you would ever leave your wife and children? Definitely. [[01:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmI7dGCEWqU&t=6480.0s)]
*  Respect. Would you ever leave your wife and kids? I believe that if I don't want to, [[01:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmI7dGCEWqU&t=6487.360000000001s)]
*  I'm going to say that right now. I do not want to leave you guys. [[01:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmI7dGCEWqU&t=6495.280000000001s)]

*  like years ago I'd write postcards, even though I didn't even have them. Where would you send them? [[01:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmI7dGCEWqU&t=6506.0s)]
*  Just to my own address and like save them for my kids from when I get older or whatever. [[01:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmI7dGCEWqU&t=6510.400000000001s)]
*  That's crazy. Right. Did you have their names already picked out or it'd be like insert name? [[01:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmI7dGCEWqU&t=6514.400000000001s)]

*  children, but I, I could never see any way how I was going to get there from where I was, [[01:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmI7dGCEWqU&t=6535.68s)]
*  where I was at. Well, what happens with me, I was with a couple recently and they've been together [[01:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmI7dGCEWqU&t=6539.68s)]
*  for five years and they got a kid on the way and hearing them talk made me realize how far away I [[01:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmI7dGCEWqU&t=6543.84s)]
*  am from where they are in life. You know, they're like, Oh, we're getting married next year. We just [[01:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmI7dGCEWqU&t=6548.4800000000005s)]
*  had a kid and like the way they would talk, like she would start talking and then he'd be like, [[01:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmI7dGCEWqU&t=6552.64s)]
*  do you want, should I finish the story? Cause you're telling me you're wrong. I'll finish the [[01:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmI7dGCEWqU&t=6556.400000000001s)]
*  story. Then they're like going back, they're like arguing with each other and they bring it to you. [[01:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmI7dGCEWqU&t=6559.360000000001s)]
*  And like, I was so disconnected to where those two were at in life of a family. And like, [[01:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmI7dGCEWqU&t=6563.04s)]
*  you know, if a family was like a, like a pie chart, like they had so much more pie than me. [[01:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmI7dGCEWqU&t=6569.04s)]
*  Like I had just a little sliver. Yeah. You were more all a mode. Yeah. I was on the side. I was [[01:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmI7dGCEWqU&t=6573.200000000001s)]
*  a little, I was a little raspberry on the side hanging out. Well, I think, but also for some [[01:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmI7dGCEWqU&t=6577.12s)]
*  people there's different paths, you know, and it's hard to battle with whatever your path has been. [[01:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmI7dGCEWqU&t=6581.6s)]
*  You know, it's like, I felt like when I was a kid, like I just didn't have like a lot of affection [[01:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmI7dGCEWqU&t=6586.72s)]
*  and stuff at home. But then as an adult, like you're saying, I got a lot more like affection is from [[01:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmI7dGCEWqU&t=6590.8s)]
*  strangers, you know? So it's almost like you just never really know what the path for life is going [[01:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmI7dGCEWqU&t=6595.280000000001s)]
*  to be. That's true. You know, you might like Robert Downey Johnson, whatever, just had a kid at 79 [[01:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmI7dGCEWqU&t=6600.0s)]
*  years old, right? Robert De Niro. Did he really? Yeah. Or whatever backed up down there. [[01:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmI7dGCEWqU&t=6605.200000000001s)]

*  I mean, and this is nine years later. That's crazy. I remember my dad would tell me stories [[01:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmI7dGCEWqU&t=6621.280000000001s)]
*  about kids in his village, like eating dirt. They were starving. That's how you know his old village [[01:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmI7dGCEWqU&t=6624.96s)]

*  in life. A lot of times really. Um, yeah, I think it's, well, it's just Anderson, especially these [[01:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmI7dGCEWqU&t=6974.400000000001s)]
*  days. I think we're all so like on social media. We're all on, like we're constantly being [[01:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmI7dGCEWqU&t=6979.6s)]
*  entertained by stuff, right? Correct. There's so much entertainment. Like you can turn on your [[01:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmI7dGCEWqU&t=6985.200000000001s)]
*  phone at any point. You can see like an amazing goal being scored. Someone, uh, battling something [[01:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmI7dGCEWqU&t=6989.04s)]
*  severe in their life. Somebody, uh, doing a go from me, somebody lost their arms, legs and head. [[01:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmI7dGCEWqU&t=6995.68s)]
*  I saw the other day, some guy lost his arms, legs and head. You can also watch a man getting [[01:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmI7dGCEWqU&t=7001.76s)]
*  hit in a thing. Yeah. And you can do go from me for both. It's crazy how much stimulation [[01:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmI7dGCEWqU&t=7005.76s)]
*  your brain is thrown at you all at once. It's the best of everything, right? All in a few minutes, [[01:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmI7dGCEWqU&t=7011.92s)]
*  but then you shut it off and you come back to whatever your regular life is. And usually I [[01:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmI7dGCEWqU&t=7015.52s)]
*  think in that time when your brain would have been kind of processing what's going on in your own [[01:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmI7dGCEWqU&t=7019.92s)]
*  life, cause your brain's kind of a processor, right? It wants to organize things. Your brain [[01:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmI7dGCEWqU&t=7024.88s)]
*  wants to organize things like that's it's like modus operandi. Like that's it's what it does. [[01:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmI7dGCEWqU&t=7029.280000000001s)]
*  It like notices patterns. It organizes things. So you have the best, most comfortable way to [[01:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmI7dGCEWqU&t=7033.76s)]
*  live and survive, right? That's like what his whole job is. So I think usually when we're relaxing or [[01:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmI7dGCEWqU&t=7039.12s)]
*  resting or giving our brain time to kind of process, and we're not just constantly entertained, [[01:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmI7dGCEWqU&t=7046.320000000001s)]
*  that's what it is. Then we are able to have more things figured out. Whereas I think now when we're [[01:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmI7dGCEWqU&t=7050.4800000000005s)]
*  just doing constant entertainment, you're not getting as much figured out like in the background. [[01:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmI7dGCEWqU&t=7056.16s)]
*  You're never giving your brain a chance to openly think. That's why I had to return the books. It's [[01:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmI7dGCEWqU&t=7061.52s)]
*  like, you know, at the library, you see all the stacks of books that were returned. You're like, [[01:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmI7dGCEWqU&t=7066.0s)]
*  damn, this is the book I really like could be in there, but I don't even know. Yeah. We're not [[01:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmI7dGCEWqU&t=7069.280000000001s)]
*  giving our brain a chance to return your books. We're just opening up millions of books. There's [[01:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmI7dGCEWqU&t=7073.52s)]
*  not anything on the shelf anymore. Exactly. There's just tons of books. Throwing books on the shelf [[01:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmI7dGCEWqU&t=7077.52s)]
*  and they fall right off. Yeah. Dewey decimal is shooting up in the corner. Like long division has [[01:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmI7dGCEWqU&t=7082.0s)]
*  been talked to in a long time. That boy turned into Ketamine ASAP down by the Hudson. But that's [[01:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmI7dGCEWqU&t=7088.4s)]
*  really kind of a neat analogy. I didn't think about that before, but that's kind of what it's like. [[01:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmI7dGCEWqU&t=7094.32s)]
*  It is because all those thoughts are in your brain, but you're just distracting with social media. [[01:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmI7dGCEWqU&t=7097.36s)]
*  And I mean, it is wild. And that's why like people fucking lose their mind, you know, on a plane before [[01:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmI7dGCEWqU&t=7103.92s)]
*  you can't take off and there's no like, there's no like wifi yet or you can't open up your laptop. [[01:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmI7dGCEWqU&t=7108.719999999999s)]
*  The dark 11, they call it that dark 11. Oh, do they? Yeah. Yeah. But that's who you are in that [[01:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmI7dGCEWqU&t=7113.12s)]
*  11 minutes is who you really are, who you are when your phone is dead. That's who you really are. [[01:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmI7dGCEWqU&t=7117.92s)]
*  When you're just sitting there at an eye hop with a dead phone and you got to make eye contact with [[01:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmI7dGCEWqU&t=7123.12s)]
*  the lady with one eye, I'll take the flapjack and what the fuck happened there? But like those [[01:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmI7dGCEWqU&t=7127.28s)]
*  moments, it's like I did that last night when I was sitting by the fireplace, I didn't have my phone [[01:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmI7dGCEWqU&t=7132.56s)]
*  and I just wanted to just, I just wanted to, I've been traveling so much. I kind of like lost [[01:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmI7dGCEWqU&t=7137.84s)]
*  my own narrative a little bit. And I just was like, what, what, what is important right now? [[01:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmI7dGCEWqU&t=7143.04s)]
*  What do I want to focus on? And I just stared into the fire and it's just like, [[01:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmI7dGCEWqU&t=7148.4s)]
*  oh, I had every thought that I've been neglecting. It felt nice. It's kind of like when people do [[01:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmI7dGCEWqU&t=7152.88s)]
*  mushrooms, it's like those thoughts get brought to the surface. Yeah. I'm trying to think one of my [[01:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmI7dGCEWqU&t=7157.5199999999995s)]
*  favorite times on mushrooms ever. I like being on a bird scooter, a little buzzed. Oh, I know that's [[01:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmI7dGCEWqU&t=7162.72s)]
*  illegal, but it feels fucking. Is it illegal? I feel like they only work if you have a buzz. [[01:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmI7dGCEWqU&t=7168.4s)]
*  Dude, I remember when we were as children, they had, we did some LSD or mushrooms, right? Or [[01:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmI7dGCEWqU&t=7173.04s)]
*  one of the two or LSD. And we went to the Waffle House and it was the first time we'd seen a gay [[01:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmI7dGCEWqU&t=7181.36s)]
*  dude, right? Or alleged gay or whatever at Waffle House. Yeah. Which is in general. I can't remember, [[01:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmI7dGCEWqU&t=7188.32s)]
*  but it was the first time we'd seen a gay dude like this close to like a kitchen. Right. And it [[01:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmI7dGCEWqU&t=7194.64s)]
*  was, they had, or it was like the first time we'd seen like a gay dude with like a menu, you know? [[01:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmI7dGCEWqU&t=7199.4400000000005s)]
*  Okay. So my buddy started just laughing so hard. We were just on drugs, right? We were laughing so [[02:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmI7dGCEWqU&t=7208.320000000001s)]
*  hard. The guy thought that he was choking, right? Because of how he was laughing. Like he was like [[02:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmI7dGCEWqU&t=7214.4800000000005s)]
*  laughing so much. He was like almost spitting up. So he starts doing the Heimlich maneuver on, [[02:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmI7dGCEWqU&t=7219.280000000001s)]
*  a dude that we had just thought was gay. Now the whole restaurant is like, what's going on here? [[02:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmI7dGCEWqU&t=7224.4s)]
*  Let's almost say restaurant. Okay. This is where like, this is normal Waffle House behavior. This [[02:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmI7dGCEWqU&t=7230.8s)]
*  is where people, and in our town, like they had a long bridge near our town. It was the longest [[02:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmI7dGCEWqU&t=7237.04s)]
*  bridge in the world for a while and it dropped off. One end of it was by our town. And the, [[02:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmI7dGCEWqU&t=7240.4s)]
*  so the police, everybody they caught on that bridge drunk drive and they would drop off at [[02:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmI7dGCEWqU&t=7246.56s)]
*  this Waffle House. So it was like a fucking- That was your drunk tank was a Waffle House? [[02:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmI7dGCEWqU&t=7250.72s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, if I was drunk, I would definitely stay. So it was like a booze. That's actually smart. [[02:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmI7dGCEWqU&t=7254.64s)]
*  Yeah. It was a booze zoo for fucking just, just derelicts, you know? So anyway, this, but this [[02:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmI7dGCEWqU&t=7258.72s)]
*  alleged gay dude is just fucking Heimlich and my buddy who's not- He's already coughed up and he's [[02:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmI7dGCEWqU&t=7266.0s)]
*  still going. Oh no, he's good. He's good. This turned out, make it up. And I'm like, is this dude [[02:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmI7dGCEWqU&t=7271.4400000000005s)]
*  really at EMT or is this dude just having like kind of like a fit of gay or whatever, you know? [[02:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmI7dGCEWqU&t=7275.6s)]
*  But he was pumping on my home pretty good. Waffle House, you walk in there sober, but you sit in that chair long enough, you feel a little bit. You don't know what drug it is. If it's an up or a down or just life, but you feel that. [[02:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmI7dGCEWqU&t=7280.72s)]
*  Oh, it's that fucking margarine buzz, homie. I fucking love Waffle House. There was a donut shop in my hometown where if you used to flash them your tits, you get free donuts. [[02:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmI7dGCEWqU&t=7290.88s)]
*  They never did it for me, but they did have- God, I love that. But like, and I was always wondering like, [[02:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmI7dGCEWqU&t=7300.96s)]
*  like, do they do a buy size? Like what if you showed your tits and like, all right, here's a donut hole? I'd be like, damn, I got fake tits for no reason. But yeah, like if you had some knockers, they'd be like, here's a bear claw. It's kind of crazy. [[02:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmI7dGCEWqU&t=7306.4800000000005s)]
*  Oh, yeah. That was the original Girls Gone Wild. God, I'd show my- God, I don't know what I would do for a bear claw. When I was a kid. So good. In our neighborhood, if you had respect for something, you'd take your shirt off. [[02:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmI7dGCEWqU&t=7319.04s)]
*  Yeah, what is that? It's just like a thing. It's almost very native. I think you would- Alpha? Yeah, no, not alpha. Just like you wanted them to, like it was a sign of respect. Like a standing ovation, but for your body. [[02:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmI7dGCEWqU&t=7329.12s)]
*  Yeah, because I think back in the day we didn't have clothes on all the time. That's true. Who invented clothes? Can you look it up? Some fucking idiot, probably. [[02:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmI7dGCEWqU&t=7340.24s)]
*  That's what I'm saying. You want to see less tit? Unless it was like a parent, then I get it. But like, the Neanderthals. Oh, Ronnie Pants did it, huh? The first known humans to make clothing, Neanderthal man survived from about 200,000 BC to about 30,000. Wow. 170,000 years. [[02:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmI7dGCEWqU&t=7352.88s)]
*  Did they do it because they were cold or they were just too horny? During this time- Maybe tried celibacy and he's like, bro, you got to curl those nips up or something. [[02:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmI7dGCEWqU&t=7372.08s)]
*  During this time, the Earth's temperature rose and fell, dramatically creating a series of ice ages throughout the northern areas. When was the first clothing made? Can you go down to that? Who was the first- [[02:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmI7dGCEWqU&t=7379.68s)]
*  It was 200,000 BCE, that's what they said. Okay. And what was it? Can we look and see what it was? Yeah, it's got to be like a leaf. [[02:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmI7dGCEWqU&t=7387.68s)]
*  The first clothes were made from natural elements, animal skin and furs, grasses and leaves and bones and shells. It was often draped or tied. [[02:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmI7dGCEWqU&t=7395.92s)]
*  However, simple needles made out of animal bone provided evidence of sewn leather and fur garments from at least 30,000 years ago. [[02:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmI7dGCEWqU&t=7406.24s)]
*  Did they even have- Yeah, I'm trying to think if you could stunt back then, you think you could? 100%. I think so. [[02:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmI7dGCEWqU&t=7414.24s)]
*  How do you roll up? When do you roll up? Not in the middle of the day. It's hot as hell, right? Because somebody's in a cave. [[02:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmI7dGCEWqU&t=7419.679999999999s)]
*  Yeah, like when he flexes in it. [[02:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmI7dGCEWqU&t=7426.639999999999s)]
*  Probably if I was- You know what I would do? I'm gonna go get some water, go to the well, no clothes. [[02:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmI7dGCEWqU&t=7430.96s)]
*  And I'd come back with the water and the clothes and they'd be like, oh my god, I beg. Oh yeah, oh this? Oh, the water or the outfit? [[02:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmI7dGCEWqU&t=7436.5599999999995s)]
*  You know, like a little subtle like, oh which one? Which one's dripping? Which one got that water, Shottie? Who wet now? [[02:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmI7dGCEWqU&t=7443.2s)]
*  The town caveman? I don't know. When would you do it? [[02:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmI7dGCEWqU&t=7450.4s)]
*  I don't- That's a good question, bro. I think if you roll in around dinner with a special deal, like a little dessert or a little- [[02:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmI7dGCEWqU&t=7453.839999999999s)]
*  Yeah, for dessert. Yeah, fruit or something. You bring a fucking apple they never seen? Dude. [[02:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmI7dGCEWqU&t=7460.639999999999s)]
*  Everybody's smashing, bro. And dude, back in the day, there was no way to let people know you were happy except to probably jerk off. [[02:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmI7dGCEWqU&t=7466.719999999999s)]
*  You think? Oh, I'm sure if you brought- What about snake figures? Or like, what the fuck's it called? Cave art? [[02:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmI7dGCEWqU&t=7473.04s)]
*  Hieroglyphics? No. Somebody. What is it? Maybe. If you're stuck in a room, you're stuck in a cave, right? [[02:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmI7dGCEWqU&t=7480.16s)]
*  You're in there by fire and somebody brings an apple and you've never fucking seen one. You take a bite of it? [[02:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmI7dGCEWqU&t=7487.5199999999995s)]
*  Oh, that would do things to me. I still feel that way. A cold Granny Smith, I would take that over sex a lot of days. [[02:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmI7dGCEWqU&t=7493.04s)]
*  Cold Granny Smith, little bit of peanut butter on it. [[02:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmI7dGCEWqU&t=7500.0s)]
*  Come on now. She'll never leave you unread. [[02:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmI7dGCEWqU&t=7502.88s)]
*  Do you DM a lot of like girls that you think are attractive or you- No. [[02:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmI7dGCEWqU&t=7505.84s)]
*  They hit you up. I usually wait until people like DM me. Because I'm so scared of rejection. [[02:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmI7dGCEWqU&t=7509.76s)]
*  That like I have sent like a DM to like like a hot chick that I thought was like pretty cute or something. [[02:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmI7dGCEWqU&t=7515.52s)]
*  Yeah. And it fucks with my ego because if I hit them up and they don't respond then I'm like, oh, all right. [[02:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmI7dGCEWqU&t=7520.4800000000005s)]
*  Maybe I'm just invisible. And who knows? She maybe is dating somebody or she's not into super sexy buff guys like me. [[02:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmI7dGCEWqU&t=7526.24s)]
*  Like who knows what the flaw is? Yeah, but what about you? Do you? [[02:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmI7dGCEWqU&t=7532.88s)]
*  I sent, let me think, I sent Bruce Willis' daughter, his daughter's a DM one time and she didn't write me back. [[02:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmI7dGCEWqU&t=7536.64s)]
*  But how did that, did that do anything for your ego or were you just like damn? [[02:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmI7dGCEWqU&t=7542.400000000001s)]

*  But I remember like 2015 I signed up for it and thank god it took so long because I was trashed then probably [[02:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmI7dGCEWqU&t=7682.24s)]
*  slightly less trash when I did it, but like [[02:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmI7dGCEWqU&t=7687.84s)]
*  ended up doing well and we got passed and everything. But it's like, it was like a two and a half year wait. [[02:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmI7dGCEWqU&t=7690.4s)]
*  It's just so funny to be like, are you available for this? You're like, huh? [[02:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmI7dGCEWqU&t=7694.8s)]
*  Who has plans for that? Oh, so I'm going to be enlisted for that. My bad. [[02:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmI7dGCEWqU&t=7698.72s)]
*  Yeah, that's the future man. The future is so weird because it's like [[02:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmI7dGCEWqU&t=7702.32s)]
*  we know it exists, [[02:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmI7dGCEWqU&t=7707.28s)]
*  but we don't. [[02:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmI7dGCEWqU&t=7710.08s)]
*  The future just like a moving walkway at the mall. It's just going to keep going [[02:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmI7dGCEWqU&t=7712.88s)]
*  no matter who's on it or who's off of it. It's just going. [[02:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmI7dGCEWqU&t=7716.72s)]
*  The future is so [[02:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmI7dGCEWqU&t=7720.08s)]
*  because we know so much about it based on what we know from the past, you know, like are we [[02:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmI7dGCEWqU&t=7722.16s)]
*  assuming about the future? [[02:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmI7dGCEWqU&t=7727.4400000000005s)]
*  It's this big bowl of assumption, you know, [[02:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmI7dGCEWqU&t=7729.120000000001s)]
*  it's this fucking [[02:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmI7dGCEWqU&t=7731.92s)]
*  grandiose play of assumption. [[02:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmI7dGCEWqU&t=7733.6s)]
*  So we've assumed exactly what's going to have based on everything that's happened. [[02:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmI7dGCEWqU&t=7736.400000000001s)]
*  But then that's the goal. [[02:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmI7dGCEWqU&t=7740.320000000001s)]
*  I think that's the dope ass thing that the future can do right if the future is a fucking real vibe, right? [[02:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmI7dGCEWqU&t=7741.6s)]
*  If he's like trick daddy or something. Oh, it's got a couple tricks up at sleep. Yeah, you know, like all flying cars. No [[02:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmI7dGCEWqU&t=7746.240000000001s)]

*  It kind of works. It's kind of better than a flying car. [[02:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmI7dGCEWqU&t=7753.839999999999s)]

*  You know percentage wise because that that came in out of nowhere at first [[02:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmI7dGCEWqU&t=8717.92s)]
*  I wanted to be like, all right, you're being annoying for no reason then I was like you can be allergic to anything just not me [[02:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmI7dGCEWqU&t=8721.36s)]
*  god [[02:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmI7dGCEWqU&t=8727.04s)]
*  Oh, there's footage of her running [[02:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmI7dGCEWqU&t=8728.400000000001s)]
*  It's funny how like people like uh, sorry to cut you off, uh, document everything on tik tok now [[02:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmI7dGCEWqU&t=8730.8s)]
*  Like like there's like in court. They're like watching tik toks, but well, here's me documenting my rash. Yeah [[02:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmI7dGCEWqU&t=8735.84s)]
*  Yeah, it's like bitch. That's a tik tok [[02:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmI7dGCEWqU&t=8742.56s)]
*  Okay, that isn't necessarily if you put it to music or whatever. What does she say in this thing zac? Can we see any of this? [[02:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmI7dGCEWqU&t=8744.64s)]
*  She was running on a delayed flight and then made a tik tok about how you can be allergic to [[02:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmI7dGCEWqU&t=8750.64s)]
*  Running and this is proof of that is because she had a reaction to it [[02:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmI7dGCEWqU&t=8755.76s)]
*  That's not like something I would have said in like eighth grade p e when they're like, all right run the mile [[02:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmI7dGCEWqU&t=8758.88s)]
*  But i'm allergic once we got on the plane. She started breaking it on to hives and this is what happened last time when her throat started closing [[02:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmI7dGCEWqU&t=8763.279999999999s)]
*  She popped a few benadryls hoping it would go away, but it didn't [[02:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmI7dGCEWqU&t=8769.599999999999s)]
*  Did she just say gang gang she ended up having to quietly use her epipen [[02:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmI7dGCEWqU&t=8774.8s)]
*  We didn't let anybody else know because knowing america they were charged. They said gang gang for no reason [[02:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmI7dGCEWqU&t=8778.4s)]
*  I think this confirmed our doubts that she's allergic to running. Thankfully. She was fine and it was just a little drowsy after [[02:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmI7dGCEWqU&t=8782.32s)]
*  What a full circle moment [[02:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmI7dGCEWqU&t=8789.199999999999s)]
*  And it's crazy. Do you think that we're getting so soft people allergic to running? [[02:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmI7dGCEWqU&t=8791.359999999999s)]
*  I think that is the environment that we're headed into as a species [[02:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmI7dGCEWqU&t=8795.359999999999s)]
*  Yeah [[02:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmI7dGCEWqU&t=8798.08s)]
*  Well, I do think that's something that you could challenge a p e teacher with or you got to run the mile [[02:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmI7dGCEWqU&t=8798.48s)]
*  I'm allergic to the mile. Uh, what do you mean? You're gonna question what i'm allergic to? [[02:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmI7dGCEWqU&t=8802.88s)]
*  Yeah, just like you're allergic to your wife. Where's the last time you saw her? [[02:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmI7dGCEWqU&t=8807.199999999999s)]
*  Start flaming the p e teacher [[02:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmI7dGCEWqU&t=8810.72s)]
*  That's the problem with every nobody here's one of the issues with everything [[02:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmI7dGCEWqU&t=8813.599999999999s)]
*  Nobody wants to follow what the kind of basic guidelines are for everything like there when I was a child [[02:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmI7dGCEWqU&t=8817.039999999999s)]
*  There was a template for everything. There was how you did it. You stood for the pledge of allegiance [[02:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmI7dGCEWqU&t=8822.8s)]
*  You didn't even know anything. Maybe you knew a fireman. Maybe your mom and fucking you know [[02:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmI7dGCEWqU&t=8827.039999999999s)]
*  Was trying to date a cop or something. That's the most you knew about the military [[02:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmI7dGCEWqU&t=8830.88s)]
*  But you stood for the pledge of allegiance, right? [[02:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmI7dGCEWqU&t=8834.48s)]
*  You like you respected you didn't question anything. You didn't question anything and now we've gotten a place where you question everything [[02:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmI7dGCEWqU&t=8837.039999999999s)]
*  But is it doing us any good really because all it is is just watching people fight [[02:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmI7dGCEWqU&t=8844.08s)]
*  And now nobody wants to do any jobs anymore because they're not respected [[02:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmI7dGCEWqU&t=8848.56s)]
*  Well, also I think it's the power of the phone too because like a p e teacher can be like that's not real [[02:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmI7dGCEWqU&t=8851.92s)]
*  You have to run the fucking mile [[02:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmI7dGCEWqU&t=8856.4s)]
*  But then you pull a phone out and they're like well now I could get fired for this and they're like, oh, all right [[02:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmI7dGCEWqU&t=8857.68s)]
*  It's like those videos where people are like acting crazy [[02:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmI7dGCEWqU&t=8862.32s)]
*  Like the caren type shit they whenever they see the phone they either double down and go even crazier [[02:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmI7dGCEWqU&t=8865.44s)]
*  I love when they go crazy. They're like, oh hello facebook live. I'm like bitch i'm on tiktok [[02:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmI7dGCEWqU&t=8870.24s)]
*  Young ass is on facebook, but they're always like, oh hello everyone. Uh, who's watching? [[02:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmI7dGCEWqU&t=8875.44s)]
*  But you either double down or you back up and you're like, oh i'm so dude [[02:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmI7dGCEWqU&t=8881.2s)]
*  I saw a guy get kicked off a flight. This is a great story. This guy got kicked off a flight [[02:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmI7dGCEWqU&t=8884.880000000001s)]
*  I was coming back from hawaii and this dude he was an older guy [[02:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmI7dGCEWqU&t=8888.72s)]
*  and uh [[02:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmI7dGCEWqU&t=8892.960000000001s)]
*  This is first class. I say this, uh, you know once well once a year after all the touring I go to hawaii [[02:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmI7dGCEWqU&t=8894.0s)]
*  It's like my like fucking chill out place and on the flight back this guy [[02:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmI7dGCEWqU&t=8898.88s)]
*  First thing goes do you guys have any vegan options for breakfast like seven amps? [[02:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmI7dGCEWqU&t=8903.439999999999s)]
*  She goes, oh no, this is all we have and it was some scrambled egg and he gets mad [[02:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmI7dGCEWqU&t=8907.039999999999s)]
*  He tosses the menu in the air and I go this we're about to pop off [[02:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmI7dGCEWqU&t=8910.32s)]
*  You can feel that fucking a little bit of hulk hogan and this dude's like 70, right? [[02:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmI7dGCEWqU&t=8913.759999999998s)]
*  Next they're playing like just kind of like ukulele just kind of casual and the tv screens. It's like it's a preset [[02:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmI7dGCEWqU&t=8918.96s)]
*  It just plays it's like it's a small world. It's just playing and he goes [[02:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmI7dGCEWqU&t=8924.64s)]
*  Can you turn this music off right and I go we're really bubbling [[02:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmI7dGCEWqU&t=8928.24s)]
*  We're getting to something good and then they go we can't turn off the music [[02:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmI7dGCEWqU&t=8932.64s)]
*  This is the most electric thing i've ever seen he pulls out his ipad [[02:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmI7dGCEWqU&t=8935.76s)]
*  And he puts on stairway to heaven by led zeppelin on full blast and he leans over to his wife and goes [[02:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmI7dGCEWqU&t=8939.2s)]
*  They'll never make music like they used to [[02:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmI7dGCEWqU&t=8944.32s)]
*  And then eventually he's playing it out loud seven minute song [[02:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmI7dGCEWqU&t=8947.04s)]
*  And it's to the point where i'm like, this is a good fucking song, you know [[02:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmI7dGCEWqU&t=8951.2s)]
*  And then essentially like they gave him a couple warnings and then uh, this like simone chick and cop outfit comes in [[02:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmI7dGCEWqU&t=8954.8s)]
*  Grabs him by the shoulder and his attitude shifts like crazy. He's like, oh, i'm so sorry [[02:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmI7dGCEWqU&t=8961.6s)]
*  I didn't mean to and then he turns the music off and they kick him off. He leaves his wife there [[02:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmI7dGCEWqU&t=8966.16s)]
*  But on the way out on the way out most badass thing he ever says he goes go on without me [[02:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmI7dGCEWqU&t=8971.2s)]
*  You'll be fine. You always are I was like this is the most I was like what the fuck is happening [[02:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmI7dGCEWqU&t=8976.16s)]
