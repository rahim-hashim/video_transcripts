# Pavel Tsatsouline Building Endurance the Right Way
**Theo Von - This Past Weekend:** [December 12, 2019](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ii845pDRC2c)
*  Let's talk about endurance. So there are different aspects to endurance. And so there's [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ii845pDRC2c&t=0.0s)]
*  cardio and there is the peripheral endurance in the muscles, muscular endurance. So first [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ii845pDRC2c&t=11.84s)]
*  of all, let's discuss how do we develop cardio. Let's discuss how we develop endurance in [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ii845pDRC2c&t=19.8s)]
*  the muscle. The best, the healthiest way to develop your cardio is just steady state exercise, [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ii845pDRC2c&t=24.68s)]
*  like running at a particular speed that's not too fast. That's very simple. That's the best way to [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ii845pDRC2c&t=33.64s)]
*  develop cardio. For most people it is. For most people it is. And so here's what's happening. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ii845pDRC2c&t=40.04s)]
*  What's happening is the heart is stretching. When you increase your heart rate up to a certain point, [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ii845pDRC2c&t=44.44s)]
*  the heart starts stretching more and it stretches more and more. So that increases the stroke [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ii845pDRC2c&t=50.88s)]
*  volume. So pretty much you get a bigger heart and that's good. That works up to not quite 90% of [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ii845pDRC2c&t=56.400000000000006s)]
*  heart rate. When you start redlining your heart rate, when you start getting to 90% and higher, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ii845pDRC2c&t=66.56s)]
*  the heart does not have time to relax fully. So it really pretty much is twitching. So you're no [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ii845pDRC2c&t=72.28s)]
*  longer really stretching that heart. So you want to be training at the metabolic intensity that's [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ii845pDRC2c&t=79.24s)]
*  much lower, something we can pretty much sustain a conversation. So like say you're running and [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ii845pDRC2c&t=87.8s)]
*  talking to your body. That's what you want to stay to develop endurance. That will to develop, [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ii845pDRC2c&t=92.32s)]
*  to stretch your heart. That's the basic method. So that's one method. So the second method is [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ii845pDRC2c&t=97.11999999999999s)]
*  interval training. And the interval training for the heart was developed by Germans decades ago [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ii845pDRC2c&t=102.88s)]
*  and these guidelines still stand. So here's what they figured out. They figured out that your, [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ii845pDRC2c&t=109.72s)]
*  well we know that this various systems in your body have inertia. So for instance notice that [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ii845pDRC2c&t=117.56s)]
*  when you're running hard and you stopped, your heart's still beating hard and then maybe 10 [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ii845pDRC2c&t=125.24s)]
*  seconds after there's a sudden drop right there. So there's that inertia. So the Germans figured out [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ii845pDRC2c&t=131.35999999999999s)]
*  if you get your heart rate up to about 85-90%, which is, it's hard but it's still not maximal. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ii845pDRC2c&t=136.92s)]
*  And then you switch to walking or jogging so the heart is still beating and so is this extra volume [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ii845pDRC2c&t=143.88s)]
*  of blood is moving and it stretches the heart. So it works really well. So you can use the interval [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ii845pDRC2c&t=150.68s)]
*  method as well but it's, it was found it's used best after a period of steady state training. It's [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ii845pDRC2c&t=159.04s)]
*  very demanding on the body and it's not, it's just, it's too easy to have problems with the heart if [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ii845pDRC2c&t=170.2s)]
*  you start using it prematurely. Then there's also such a thing as high heart rate under heavy loads. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ii845pDRC2c&t=176.72s)]
*  So in this particular case we're talking about dynamic exercises. So what's dynamic exercise? [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ii845pDRC2c&t=184.72s)]
*  Running, bicycling, skiing, even light kettlebell swings. That's dynamic exercise. When you start [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ii845pDRC2c&t=190.24s)]
*  doing static exercise, let's say you're trying to do squats, heavy squats for, you know, to get your [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ii845pDRC2c&t=198.16s)]
*  cardio so to say. That's not the best idea because that interferes with the blood flow that, it's [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ii845pDRC2c&t=203.48s)]
*  something called after load versus preload. The heart gets thicker instead of the heart gets, you [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ii845pDRC2c&t=212.28s)]
*  know, gets stretched and bigger. So it's not the optimal way to train the heart. You can, again, [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ii845pDRC2c&t=217.44s)]
*  this simple way you can use dynamic exercise and interval type training or repeat training in this [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ii845pDRC2c&t=223.24s)]
*  case to train your heart is to do an exercise that's dynamic in nature to raise your heart rate to about [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ii845pDRC2c&t=232.76s)]
*  let's say 80-90%, which would be 80-90% it would be where you can say maybe a couple words, you know. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ii845pDRC2c&t=241.44s)]
*  You're not dying yet. You can still answer a question and then you just walk around and you do [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ii845pDRC2c&t=250.68s)]
*  it again. So that's a simple way of doing it. How much time walking around? That depends. That totally [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ii845pDRC2c&t=258.52s)]
*  depends on who you are. Depends on how fast your heart rate drops back down. What do you want to, [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ii845pDRC2c&t=263.72s)]
*  is there a number? Do you want to keep it in the 140s, the 150s, it depends upon your age? [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ii845pDRC2c&t=269.28000000000003s)]
*  Okay, in this particular case you would drop it down. The original guidelines were done for young [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ii845pDRC2c&t=273.48s)]
*  people, those 120-130 beats. So you're talking about 60-65%. And pretty much if you're just [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ii845pDRC2c&t=278.44s)]
*  looking at being able to pass the talk test, which means you can talk, you know, short sentences. I [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ii845pDRC2c&t=285.6s)]
*  can speak in short, something like that, right? So for example, you do a set of 10 swings, really [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ii845pDRC2c&t=292.12s)]
*  powerful with the kettlebell, walk around a little bit. When you feel that you can speak again, you [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ii845pDRC2c&t=297.08s)]
*  do it again, do it again. So that's a simple way of doing that. But the heart is only a very small [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ii845pDRC2c&t=302.0s)]
*  part of endurance. So we definitely need to do some cardio for our health and athletes definitely [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ii845pDRC2c&t=308.68s)]
*  need to do for their performance. But what we really need to focus on is you need mitochondria. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ii845pDRC2c&t=314.76s)]
*  So mitochondria in the muscle cell. So that's where energy is being converted aerobically, [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ii845pDRC2c&t=321.92s)]
*  which means efficiently. So if you look at the way your muscle uses energy, so you will get this [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ii845pDRC2c&t=329.40000000000003s)]
*  energy with food converted, it goes down. Eventually, the final currency, so to say, [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ii845pDRC2c&t=338.64s)]
*  is something called ATP. But it's only, you know, you only have it for a few seconds. So it has to [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ii845pDRC2c&t=345.8s)]
*  be reloaded. So we have three main energy systems. So we have the creatine phosphate system. It's [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ii845pDRC2c&t=352.04s)]
*  very powerful, but it's only going to go for just some seconds. And it's clean burning. We have [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ii845pDRC2c&t=359.24s)]
*  aerobic system that's not powerful at all, but it's longer lasting. And we have the glycolytic [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ii845pDRC2c&t=364.88s)]
*  system that's kind of in between that dumps a lot of acid and other fatigue metabolites in there. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ii845pDRC2c&t=370.16s)]
*  So what we want to do is we want to develop this mitochondria in our muscles. It's easy to do in [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ii845pDRC2c&t=375.76000000000005s)]
*  slow fibers. And it's a little more involved in fast fibers. I'll tell you how we can do that. But [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ii845pDRC2c&t=385.04s)]
*  it can be done. So what we're looking for, instead of trying to trash the muscle with acid, [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ii845pDRC2c&t=391.52s)]
*  we are trying to train in a way that to produce less acid. And then only before the competition, [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ii845pDRC2c&t=398.64s)]
*  right before the competition, a couple weeks out, you do a couple of kind of smokers like that to [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ii845pDRC2c&t=409.0s)]
*  get yourself used to that thing. So the way we develop mitochondria, which means make your [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ii845pDRC2c&t=414.68s)]
*  muscle oxidative, make your muscle enduring and not polluting. In slow fibers, it's simply moving [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ii845pDRC2c&t=421.8s)]
*  right below an aerobic threshold. So on aerobic threshold, it's that intensity at which you, you [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ii845pDRC2c&t=429.64s)]
*  know, acid is accumulating just up to a certain point in the state, that steady state, and you can [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ii845pDRC2c&t=440.16s)]
*  keep disposing of that for a while, for quite a while. As soon as you go above it, very rapidly, [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ii845pDRC2c&t=444.36s)]
*  you crash. So running right below the aerobic threshold is the primary training method for [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ii845pDRC2c&t=450.96000000000004s)]
*  endurance athletes. And how do you know that you ran the threshold when you fail in the talk test? [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ii845pDRC2c&t=463.40000000000003s)]
*  That's a simple way to do that. And it's very interesting that endurance athletes, even though [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ii845pDRC2c&t=468.76s)]
*  who are not necessarily well educated, they kind of tend to gravitate through that intensity. And [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ii845pDRC2c&t=474.4s)]
*  so what happens is we are producing just small amounts of acid, and the body finally is able to, [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ii845pDRC2c&t=480.44s)]
*  you know, produce less and less. So that's how we train aerobic, I'm sorry, that's how we train [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ii845pDRC2c&t=487.36s)]
*  mitochondria in slow fibers. For fast fibers, it becomes something more interesting. So the [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ii845pDRC2c&t=494.4s)]
*  conditions, the conditions for making the mitochondria be able to handle more traffic without [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ii845pDRC2c&t=503.23999999999995s)]
*  producing as much acid is push them just to the edge of acidosis, just, just to the edge, and do [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ii845pDRC2c&t=513.4399999999999s)]
*  it over and over and over. So Professor Verkhoshansky, back in the 80s, figured out that, that's the guy [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ii845pDRC2c&t=521.16s)]
*  who invented plyometrics and so on. So he figured out, so here's what we do. Imagine that you are [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ii845pDRC2c&t=527.52s)]
*  sprinting, let's say you're sprinting for five, seven seconds, and then you're just walking, and [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ii845pDRC2c&t=534.48s)]
*  you're sprinting again, and you're just walking. But you're doing that, you're measuring your blood [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ii845pDRC2c&t=543.04s)]
*  lactate, and it still keeps below the threshold, and you sustain that for, let's say, 40 minutes. So [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ii845pDRC2c&t=548.92s)]
*  think of this for a second. So you're sprinting very intensely, but you stop before you start [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ii845pDRC2c&t=556.0s)]
*  burning. You get to the point of just light muscular fatigue, and you do it over and over and over. So [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ii845pDRC2c&t=562.56s)]
*  if we talk about the coaching terminology, it's repeat training versus interval training. So what [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ii845pDRC2c&t=570.24s)]
*  is interval training? Pardon me, Joe, I have to take a step to the side. So there are three types [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ii845pDRC2c&t=580.6800000000001s)]
*  of rest periods between your sets, whether you're running, lifting, whatever. So there's a stress [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ii845pDRC2c&t=586.92s)]
*  period. That means that you will have a harder time to do the same thing, or you will not be [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ii845pDRC2c&t=592.32s)]
*  able to repeat it, right? That's interval training. There is the supercompensation period, which means [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ii845pDRC2c&t=600.6800000000001s)]
*  if you wait extra long time, you'll perform even better. Like, for example, if you do a set of [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ii845pDRC2c&t=607.6800000000001s)]
*  pull-ups, wait for 15 minutes, you might be able to do more 15 minutes later. And there is the [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ii845pDRC2c&t=612.6800000000001s)]
*  ordinary period, which is that you'll be able to repeat it over and over. So that's in coaching [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ii845pDRC2c&t=620.08s)]
*  speak, it's called repeat training, repeat versus interval. So we're trying to sustain that same [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ii845pDRC2c&t=624.5200000000001s)]
*  level of performance for 40 minutes, let's say. So that's an example of how we develop mitochondria [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ii845pDRC2c&t=630.2800000000001s)]
*  and fast-reach fibers. And the same thing we can do with kettlebell swings, the same thing you can [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ii845pDRC2c&t=637.6800000000001s)]
*  do working in a heavy bag and so on and so forth. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ii845pDRC2c&t=641.64s)]
