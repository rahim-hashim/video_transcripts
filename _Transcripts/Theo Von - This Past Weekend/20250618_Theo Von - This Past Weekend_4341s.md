*  You're like, what am I? You go into different rooms and like, what does this feel like? What? Why I was coming back in here? [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=70.0s)]
*  Does it feel like it's in here? You know, it's like you're like on a scavenger hunt just with your own memory. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=78.0s)]
*  That's how I feel. I just it's just one of those days. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=87.0s)]
*  The whole day feels like that kind of you ever have those type of days where you're like this, this, this ain't my day. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=92.0s)]
*  This day, me and this day don't even know each other. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=101.0s)]
*  You know, you're alive the whole day, but like you just don't even belong to the calendar. Like you just loitering. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=106.0s)]
*  That's the kind that's where I'm at. That's where I'm at. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=115.0s)]
*  And I don't know if it's the world make me feel that way. It's just me. I mean, it's you know. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=121.0s)]
*  But it's OK. You know, I show up here. I'm happy to be here today with you guys. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=128.0s)]
*  Yeah, my name's Theo and I'm happy to be here. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=135.0s)]
*  Happy belated Father's Day. Let's say that. Happy belated Father's Day to all the men out there who [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=140.0s)]
*  who make those choices, even the choices their children don't see to show up. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=149.0s)]
*  You know, they do the extra thing. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=155.0s)]
*  You know, they do the things they're supposed to do as a father. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=159.0s)]
*  You know, they follow the blueprint. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=163.0s)]
*  Happy belated Father's Day to those guys. And sorry we didn't get this episode out last week, but here we are. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=168.0s)]
*  Right here we are. And some people, you may not have a father, right? [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=177.0s)]
*  Your father may have passed or he may not be in your life. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=183.0s)]
*  You know, I can relate to some of that where like sometimes I'll find pieces of my father and other and other men. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=185.0s)]
*  You know, there's certain men I'll go to for like certain advice or, you know, and I get a little piece of fatherhood there. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=192.0s)]
*  There's certain men I'll call when maybe I'm scared or maybe when things are good. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=201.0s)]
*  And I'll share them and I'll and I'll get a little piece of fatherhood there. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=207.0s)]
*  So happy belated Father's Day to all the fathers or even just all the men in the world that that create pieces of fatherhood for others. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=210.0s)]
*  Even sometimes they don't even know they do it, I bet. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=220.0s)]
*  What's going on? Oh, I went to Qatar. I hadn't even talked about that. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=226.0s)]
*  I went to the Middle East. I went to the Middle East. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=232.0s)]
*  What's going on? Oh, I went to Qatar. I hadn't even talked about that. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=234.0s)]
*  I went to the Middle East, baby. And the Middle East, dude, it's I mean, it is. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=239.0s)]
*  It's something it's like you ever open the oven door. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=247.0s)]
*  And that bitch is on. That's the Middle East, boy. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=252.0s)]
*  That bitch is on like the whole time I'm there. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=258.0s)]
*  I'm just looking to like turn off the preheat switch or something. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=261.0s)]
*  I'm like, damn, somebody set this bitch on broil. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=264.0s)]
*  It's the sun is over there is geeking, bro. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=269.0s)]
*  The sun is over there is down. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=273.0s)]
*  That's should they the heat come down on you like, dang, bro, the sun trying to press me. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=275.0s)]
*  This heat feeling a little bit zesty this shit, because that heat will get everywhere. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=280.0s)]
*  Get down the back of your neck like, God, that heat start undoing your belt buckle. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=284.0s)]
*  You're like, gosh, this sun getting zesty. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=290.0s)]
*  That's heat game, bro. That's heat game, man. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=295.0s)]
*  But I got invited over there by the Qatari and it's Q-A-T-A-R. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=300.0s)]
*  That's what it's how it's spelled. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=307.0s)]
*  And it doesn't have a U in it. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=310.0s)]
*  And the whole time I'm thinking like, should I get these guys a gift or something for inviting me over? [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=311.0s)]
*  And I was like, I'll get him the letter U. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=315.0s)]
*  You know, let's get a big box, a U in a box and give that to him. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=317.0s)]
*  But then you're like, no, they doing their own shit, bro. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=321.0s)]
*  They say, you know, they conserving hell, they're conserving water, they're conserving letters, too. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=325.0s)]
*  And I got invited over there by the I guess it's the like the kind of the board that [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=330.0s)]
*  the tourism board, I guess. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=338.0s)]
*  So that's who I got invited over there by. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=342.0s)]
*  And it was in conjunction with a time that Donald Trump was going to be there performing for the troops or speaking to the troops. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=344.0s)]
*  And so I got to perform that same day, probably maybe like an hour or so before he was up there. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=352.0s)]
*  The show was it was hectic and the show was hectic because there weren't supposed to be any cameras. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=359.0s)]
*  I got on stage there were like 20 news cameras. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=366.0s)]
*  So that was a total surprise. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=368.0s)]
*  And and so we had to make some adjustments or whatever. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=370.0s)]
*  But just getting to be there and see the base and see the soldiers over there and see the people that, you know, that made that commitment. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=374.0s)]
*  It was very inspiring and it was just real, you know. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=383.0s)]
*  And so that that was really special. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=389.0s)]
*  I felt very lucky to just get to witness that to be allowed to show up. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=391.0s)]
*  What else did we do there? [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=398.0s)]
*  Oh, it's very organized there. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=399.0s)]
*  The sidewalks that bitch stays in line, bro. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=400.0s)]
*  You know, I'm from Louisiana and the sidewalk there, they got one of them bitches to be at a 40 degree. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=404.0s)]
*  The next plant, the next cement plank will be at like a six degree. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=410.0s)]
*  The next one will have a damn off ramp on. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=416.0s)]
*  I've seen a sidewalk with a damn off ramp on it in Louisiana, bro, because the oak trees, the roots grow up under the sidewalk and they'll push that bitch off, dog. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=419.0s)]
*  Bro, you trying to walk down the street, you end up fucking six blocks over, bro. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=431.0s)]
*  If you follow the sidewalk, that bitch will take you wherever, dude. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=435.0s)]
*  So a lot of times in Louisiana, you see somebody walking right along the side of the street. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=440.0s)]
*  And that's why, because them sidewalks, them bitches, they don't care. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=444.0s)]
*  They each each piece of cement barely even knows the next piece. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=450.0s)]
*  Them bitches, they had odds, you know, and then you'll have one tsunami, you know, where it'll hit a damn sinkhole. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=455.0s)]
*  That bitch would be 40 feet down. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=461.0s)]
*  You know, you trying to go half a block and next, you know, you got repelling equipment on. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=464.0s)]
*  So it's just heading, going down a Louisiana sidewalk is very intense. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=469.0s)]
*  But but in Qatar or Qatar, they say Qatar. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=473.0s)]
*  That's everything is very organized. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=478.0s)]
*  Every lamp light, every every every day, it's pristine. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=480.0s)]
*  You know, it's like a Christmas village, but but they don't believe in Christmas. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=485.0s)]
*  You know, I don't think anyway, I don't know if they do or not. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=489.0s)]
*  Let me see. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=492.0s)]
*  Do Muslims believe in Christmas? [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=493.0s)]
*  No, Muslims do not celebrate Christmas. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=505.0s)]
*  If Jesus, peace be upon him, is so revered in Islam, why do we not celebrate his birthday? [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=507.0s)]
*  It is necessary to point out that Jesus and his mother, Mary, are revered highly by Muslims. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=512.0s)]
*  As far as celebrating the Christmas as the birthday of Jesus is concerned, [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=518.0s)]
*  the Muslim community do not celebrate it just as we do not celebrate the birthdays of any other prophet. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=522.0s)]
*  We believe that celebrating a prophet's birth amounts to adopting that prophet's teachings as a way of life. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=528.0s)]
*  If the teachings are not followed, the Almighty's displeasure is invoked. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=533.0s)]
*  Yeah. So anyway, they got, you know, they got a different setup over there. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=536.0s)]
*  But yeah, all the and all a lot of the buildings, they look very much they have like a castle top. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=541.0s)]
*  You ever you ever see like a rook piece if you're playing chess or the top of a castle, it's like this. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=547.0s)]
*  It's got a little square goes up and then it goes down and up and down like a riveting kind of every building in Qatar was like that. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=554.0s)]
*  I mean, you're like, damn, is that a damn fortress? [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=563.0s)]
*  And they're like, damn, nah, son, that's a damn Carl's Jr. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=567.0s)]
*  Bro, that's a nah, they just protect in the fucking new chicken sandwich in that bitch, you know. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=570.0s)]
*  But it was really awesome just to be there and see what it was like. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=577.0s)]
*  The tourism people that had me come, the I think it was like the prime minister maybe or somebody else. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=581.0s)]
*  They were very accommodating. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=587.0s)]
*  They invited me over to their house for dinner, which was great. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=589.0s)]
*  And you sit there and if they bring do they got condiments, they won the condiment war, bro. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=593.0s)]
*  No, we got a couple condiments. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=602.0s)]
*  You see a little bit of cats. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=604.0s)]
*  You see some mayonnaise, baby, you know, you see that mustard, bro. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=606.0s)]
*  And sometimes it's mustarded, you know, but you eat it anyway, bro. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=609.0s)]
*  You don't have a lot because you don't want to catch nothing, you know, or pass it on to your children. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=613.0s)]
*  But you eat over there, they got they had a little cut of lamb or something and they got 30 sauces. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=618.0s)]
*  They got shit. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=624.0s)]
*  They got a damn one of the sauces had a damn deep end on the dish of it. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=626.0s)]
*  I was like, yeah, that sauce got a shallow, a deep end. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=630.0s)]
*  It was they had a damn a little hot tub full of them, some turquoise fuchsia afterpaste or something, everything. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=635.0s)]
*  Bloop, bloop, bloop, bloop, bloop, bloop. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=643.0s)]
*  Just condimented. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=646.0s)]
*  So that was wonderful just to be invited to be able to do that. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=650.0s)]
*  Oh, they have dates over there. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=654.0s)]
*  That's like one of their big fruits or vegetables or shit. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=656.0s)]
*  I mean, a date. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=660.0s)]
*  They're like, oh, you like dates. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=661.0s)]
*  I'm like, that's just a fucking old ass plum, homie. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=663.0s)]
*  That bitch is a senior citizen plum, brother. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=666.0s)]
*  That's what you guys are eating. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=669.0s)]
*  But they were just great senses of humor. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=673.0s)]
*  Like it was just fun, man. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=676.0s)]
*  I went to like a three hour dinner and it was a blast and everything there. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=677.0s)]
*  They have huge buildings for like a lot of stuff because they have extra money to build, you know, don't have like a damn 30 floor anytime fitness in that bit, you know, and that the you be, you know, you're doing curls on the 17th floor. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=681.0s)]
*  They got leg press on the ninth floor, you know, and they got saltwater baths down there on the on the third floor. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=695.0s)]
*  You know, on the second floor, then they got a leak, obviously, coming from the ceiling. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=702.0s)]
*  But that's how gravity is, you know. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=706.0s)]
*  What was else was interesting really about it? [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=710.0s)]
*  We almost stayed for a Travis Scott concert the night after, but we didn't. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=714.0s)]
*  One thing that's interesting over there, they had the World Cup a few years ago. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=719.0s)]
*  So there's still a lot of these huge soccer stadiums, right? [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=724.0s)]
*  And they're kind of just, you know, they use them for different events, but they're just everywhere. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=729.0s)]
*  You're like, oh, there's a soccer stadium. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=733.0s)]
*  There's a soccer stadium. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=735.0s)]
*  It's kind of fascinating just to see like all these huge empty soccer stadiums out in the desert. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=737.0s)]
*  What else? We got to swim in the Persian Gulf right outside our hotel. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=744.0s)]
*  They had a Persian part of the Persian Gulf. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=747.0s)]
*  So I got to swim out there real salty. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=749.0s)]
*  Nice. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=752.0s)]
*  What else? [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=754.0s)]
*  Oh, let me think. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=755.0s)]
*  Oh, and then I had some people say asking me, were you compromised by the Qatari government? [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=756.0s)]
*  Were you a spy? [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=763.0s)]
*  No, I would never be a spy. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=766.0s)]
*  I don't think I would. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=768.0s)]
*  I don't think I would be a good spy, dude. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=770.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=773.0s)]
*  I could. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=775.0s)]
*  If it's like, you know, I know I don't. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=777.0s)]
*  I guess spies have to hide all the time. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=781.0s)]
*  I wouldn't do it. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=783.0s)]
*  I wouldn't do it. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=784.0s)]
*  So, no, I didn't get asked to be a spy. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=785.0s)]
*  Part of me was almost low key hoping I would or something like that. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=788.0s)]
*  I was like, why are they having me come over? [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=791.0s)]
*  But I didn't get asked to be a spy. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=793.0s)]
*  I didn't get what's it called when you get compromised or whatever. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=796.0s)]
*  None of that shit happened to me. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=801.0s)]
*  I didn't even get an offer, which that kind of bummed me out. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=803.0s)]
*  But yeah, they didn't ask me to say anything specific about their place or them or anything. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=807.0s)]
*  All they did was just treat me very nice. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=813.0s)]
*  I went with my tour manager and we got to wear the traditional garbs. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=815.0s)]
*  It's one of the thobes, one of the nice robes. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=820.0s)]
*  I have a picture of us in it on YouTube. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=823.0s)]
*  I mean, everybody, it looks kind of like an altar boy. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=826.0s)]
*  Like everybody looks like an altar boy. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=830.0s)]
*  You know, it looks like somebody's about to get molested, dude. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=831.0s)]
*  It definitely seems like they holding a damn molestival, you know, like, like. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=834.0s)]
*  But then you realize, oh, that's just the garb. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=839.0s)]
*  And it's just almost like a private school. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=841.0s)]
*  That's what I learned. So that everybody wears the same thing. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=843.0s)]
*  So there's not like a level of hierarchy between clothing or anything like that. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=845.0s)]
*  Anything else about it that was super fascinating? [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=850.0s)]
*  It was a very short trip. It was like 36 hours. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=853.0s)]
*  I don't think I slept the whole time. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=856.0s)]
*  I hit jet lag. I didn't worry about it and then just slept on the way home. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=858.0s)]
*  But, oh, you can't like there's not like places to just go drink and stuff. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=864.0s)]
*  So you could drink at your hotels. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=868.0s)]
*  Everybody's kind of covered up. So you don't. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=871.0s)]
*  It feels very it felt very proper. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=873.0s)]
*  That was a kind of the energy that I got. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=877.0s)]
*  But then you're talking to a lot of the guys there and a lot of them, [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=880.0s)]
*  they went to like University of Oregon or, you know, Texas A&M or something. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=883.0s)]
*  So you're like, oh, this guy's just in this in this kind of fancy outfit. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=889.0s)]
*  You know, he looks like a baby angel. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=894.0s)]
*  Like everybody looks like they would be on top of a Christmas tree. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=895.0s)]
*  But they a lot of them, that's just once they go back to their country, [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=898.0s)]
*  that's how they operate. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=902.0s)]
*  So but it was a great experience. I'm glad I got to do it. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=904.0s)]
*  We got to go all Assad Air Base was the place. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=908.0s)]
*  And thank you to everybody that station there that's stationed anywhere. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=912.0s)]
*  Happy belated 250th birthday to the Army. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=915.0s)]
*  But, yeah, I just yeah, I really enjoyed it, you know, [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=921.0s)]
*  because I think I always had this idea in my head of I don't know. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=924.0s)]
*  I think the Middle East is also is often framed as kind of scary. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=929.0s)]
*  And it was definitely intriguing, like very like Casablanca. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=934.0s)]
*  Like you're just wondering what's going on everywhere. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=938.0s)]
*  But I didn't feel like threatened or scared at all, you know. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=942.0s)]
*  And I was also on a U.S. military base for half of one day. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=948.0s)]
*  So that's I mean, the dogs have my back over there. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=951.0s)]
*  So that was really beautiful. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=956.0s)]
*  But, yeah, I would go back. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=959.0s)]
*  So just want to share that about that experience. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=961.0s)]
*  And no, nobody paid me to say that. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=964.0s)]
*  I've never been I've never been paid for. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=966.0s)]
*  I mean, I get paid for advertisements and stuff, but I've never been had anybody say, [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=968.0s)]
*  we need you to say this or not say this in my whole life. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=975.0s)]
*  So, yeah, just want to say that. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=979.0s)]
*  Or are they paying me? [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=984.0s)]
*  Dun, dun, dun. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=987.0s)]
*  What else? [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=990.0s)]
*  Oh, sorry, I feel nervous today. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=992.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=995.0s)]
*  I just feel like it's just not, you know, it's just not like this day is never going to fit perfect. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=997.0s)]
*  You know what? You know what I've been thinking about is just like a lot like just about your voice, right? [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=1001.0s)]
*  Like just having a voice. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=1006.0s)]
*  Like, what does it mean? [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=1008.0s)]
*  You know, because sometimes it feels to me sometimes like we're in a place where people get afraid to speak up. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=1010.0s)]
*  You know, I get afraid to speak up. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=1017.0s)]
*  So maybe it's not people. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=1020.0s)]
*  Maybe it's just me. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=1022.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=1023.0s)]
*  So let me just say me. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=1024.0s)]
*  So I'm not feel like I'm putting that on anybody. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=1025.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=1027.0s)]
*  I wonder sometimes like, man, it's like, I don't know if what I want to say is right. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=1028.0s)]
*  You know, like it feels right, but I don't know, you know, and so then I get scared to speak up. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=1034.0s)]
*  And I just wonder if that's I think having some, you know, knowing when kind of hold them, know when to fold them, know when, you know, or not that walk away, but no. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=1042.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=1053.0s)]
*  Know when to say something, know when not to say something is important. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=1054.0s)]
*  But yeah, I just I think I've been thinking a lot about that, like having a voice. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=1056.0s)]
*  Like, what does it mean to have a voice and, you know, and to be able to share and to speak up and, you know, and when when do you do that? [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=1061.0s)]
*  I think that's been something that's been on my mind a lot lately. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=1070.0s)]
*  Personally, I did a 72 hour fast, 73 hours. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=1073.0s)]
*  I made it to, which is pretty cool. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=1080.0s)]
*  It's kind of scary, but it wasn't that scary. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=1082.0s)]
*  I felt good about it. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=1084.0s)]
*  I'm glad that I did it. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=1085.0s)]
*  I battled a bit with dehydration, chewed some gum that didn't have anything in it basically to make me feel like I was having something sometimes. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=1088.0s)]
*  And then I would put salt on my hand and lick it and just drink some water with it. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=1096.0s)]
*  What else? [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=1101.0s)]
*  What else is happening? [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=1102.0s)]
*  Let's get into some calls. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=1103.0s)]
*  There's a lot that's going on in the world right now. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=1105.0s)]
*  We'll get into some of that. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=1107.0s)]
*  I don't know if they're trying to get us into a war with Iran or not, America, if Israel is trying to. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=1108.0s)]
*  I don't trust the Israel leader at all. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=1114.0s)]
*  I don't believe anything that guy says. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=1119.0s)]
*  I don't think that our soldiers should have to go and defend stuff that they start. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=1122.0s)]
*  I'm not a soldier, so I'm obviously speaking out of turn. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=1129.0s)]
*  I'm not even brave enough to serve. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=1133.0s)]
*  So there's that element. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=1135.0s)]
*  But that is kind of how I feel, I guess. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=1137.0s)]
*  I don't know if I'm going to be able to defend myself. [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=1140.0s)]
*  I don't know if I'm going to be able to defend myself. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=1143.0s)]
*  I don't know if I'm going to be able to defend myself. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=1145.0s)]
*  There's that element. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=1147.0s)]
*  But that is kind of how I feel, I guess. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=1150.0s)]
*  And so it's like, yeah, when do I speak? [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=1152.0s)]
*  When do I say that? [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=1154.0s)]
*  Because it feels like you're trying to push Trump to go do that. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=1157.0s)]
*  And it's like, who makes that choice? [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=1160.0s)]
*  Does he make that choice? [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=1163.0s)]
*  And then what do we get? [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=1164.0s)]
*  What's the win for us? [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=1167.0s)]
*  We're just involved in some other thing while we have suffering here at home. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=1168.0s)]
*  So maybe something like that is like, yeah, should I even speak up? [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=1176.0s)]
*  Because I'm not in service. [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=1180.0s)]
*  Servicemen and women may be like, we'll do it. [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=1182.0s)]
*  And that's their commitment and their job. [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=1184.0s)]
*  But yeah, I just, I don't know. [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=1189.0s)]
*  That guy really scares me. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=1193.0s)]
*  And I don't know why we support them. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=1196.0s)]
*  I don't understand that. [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=1199.0s)]
*  I wish they would really give us a better explanation, [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=1201.0s)]
*  especially after the massacres in Gaza. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=1204.0s)]
*  I don't understand. [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=1209.0s)]
*  I do not understand that. [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=1210.0s)]
*  And some people say, well, you don't know enough about it. [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=1214.0s)]
*  That may and I may not. [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=1216.0s)]
*  But it's like, can I still speak about it? [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=1219.0s)]
*  Can I speak about how I feel about it? [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=1223.0s)]
*  You know, moments like that. [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=1228.0s)]
*  When do I need to speak up and share just for myself? [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=1230.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=1237.0s)]
*  You know, and not even try to, I don't think this is virtue signaling. [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=1239.0s)]
*  I don't know exactly what that is. [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=1242.0s)]
*  I was talking with my producer about it today. [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=1243.0s)]
*  But I think I'm talking about a voice for my like, when do I speak up for myself? [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=1248.0s)]
*  Let's take some calls here that came in. [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=1256.0s)]
*  You guys had calls about some interesting stuff and we'll get into it. [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=1258.0s)]
*  Hey, Theo. [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=1262.0s)]
*  I was calling to say thank you for your support of the Palestinian people. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=1263.0s)]
*  I know I sound like Lib, Snowflake, whatever the fuck those guys think of people who support the Palestinians. [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=1273.0s)]
*  I don't think that. [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=1283.0s)]
*  I don't think somebody supporting what appears to be like a massacre of a lot of children. [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=1284.0s)]
*  I don't see it. [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=1291.0s)]
*  I'm shocked that there aren't more voices sometimes speaking up. [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=1292.0s)]
*  But that's also coming from a place where, you know, I can take care of myself, I know, and feed myself and roof myself for the rest of my life. [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=1295.0s)]
*  And so other people's lives are different. [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=1305.0s)]
*  And so, yeah, I can be surprised by that, but I can also totally understand that for sure. [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=1308.0s)]
*  Onward. [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=1314.0s)]
*  Hearing you today on the podcast with JD Vance speaking up for those people who have no voices. [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=1315.0s)]
*  Like, I think I ovulated while I was listening to the podcast. [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=1322.0s)]
*  Whoa, dang it. [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=1326.0s)]
*  Easter came early right there. [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=1328.0s)]
*  Well, thank you for the call. [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=1331.0s)]
*  I appreciate you sharing what you thought. [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=1333.0s)]
*  And yeah, I don't think it's like a choice to just try and speak up about Gaza and about Palestine. [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=1335.0s)]
*  I think for me, it just feels like there's not even a choice. [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=1341.0s)]
*  It's just like, how can you watch this? [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=1347.0s)]
*  It's like, am I insane? [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=1349.0s)]
*  I'm sorry that it took me so long to say something. [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=1352.0s)]
*  To be very honest, I was afraid, you know, I think I was afraid. [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=1355.0s)]
*  I think I, you know, it's just like trying to connect your instinct to your voice sometimes. [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=1360.0s)]
*  I think that's always been something that's been a little bit tough for me. [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=1368.0s)]
*  But I didn't think that I did a good job, to be honest with you, on the Vance interview. [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=1372.0s)]
*  I had follow-up questions about certain parts of it, right? [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=1378.0s)]
*  I had follow-up questions about, you know, the surveillance state and the genocide and what else? [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=1381.0s)]
*  Oh, the money that we give Israel. [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=1391.0s)]
*  Like, I had follow-up questions about these things. [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=1393.0s)]
*  I just, I don't know. [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=1395.0s)]
*  I don't know if I got like afraid or I don't know. [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=1398.0s)]
*  And I think part of me gets stuck in this space where it's like, well, this is a comedy podcast. [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=1403.0s)]
*  But then a lot of like life starts to get mixed into it. [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=1408.0s)]
*  And then it's like, well, what do I guess I think, well, what do people want? [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=1411.0s)]
*  You know? [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=1421.0s)]
*  And so that probably has something to do with it. [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=1424.0s)]
*  I think the last time that JD came on and I was very grateful for him. [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=1428.0s)]
*  I like JD. [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=1433.0s)]
*  I was very grateful that he came on. [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=1434.0s)]
*  We'd known like a month in advance that he was coming. [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=1437.0s)]
*  But last time he was like campaigning, right? [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=1440.0s)]
*  It was just him and his cousin in the room. [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=1444.0s)]
*  And it just, it felt a little bit less pressure. [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=1446.0s)]
*  This didn't feel like a ton of pressure, but it was, you know, he had like his campaign team and stuff and their Secret Service there. [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=1448.0s)]
*  And they can kind of wrap up the interview whenever. [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=1453.0s)]
*  You know, I think that fear was in my head. [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=1457.0s)]
*  Like maybe, well, if I say the wrong thing, are they just going to kind of shut down the interview? [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=1460.0s)]
*  I'm not saying that that was true at all. [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=1464.0s)]
*  I'm just saying that that was something that was probably in my head. [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=1467.0s)]
*  And then you realize that there's a level of kind of diplomacy, you know, what is diplomacy? [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=1473.0s)]
*  Look it up. [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=1480.0s)]
*  OK. [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=1481.0s)]
*  Of or concerning the profession, activity or skill of managing relations. [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=1482.0s)]
*  It says international relations, but I just think relations, right? [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=1489.0s)]
*  Like I was like, oh, well, if I try, if I ask too much, will they not want to come back again? [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=1492.0s)]
*  Will I lose the bridge to be able to communicate with him? [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=1500.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=1503.0s)]
*  For me, that was something. [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=1506.0s)]
*  So I'm just trying to manage it, you know, because you start to realize that in politics that there's a there's a level of give and take with all of those, all those meetings they go into and all the votes and the, you know, [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=1508.0s)]
*  they're all like behind the scenes, like trading this option for OK, well, I'll help support you here if you can help support me. [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=1518.0s)]
*  You know, there's just so much of that. [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=1526.0s)]
*  It's very much that Game of Thrones type of energy. [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=1528.0s)]
*  But yeah, but I wish I'd have spoken up a little bit. [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=1530.0s)]
*  You know, I felt like like Mr. Vance gave more political answers this time. [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=1533.0s)]
*  So it felt different. [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=1539.0s)]
*  I don't think I was as prepared for that. [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=1541.0s)]
*  I think sometimes it seemed like I don't know if he answered exactly what I was asking, but I it's my job to like fine tune the question or make sure that I at least get my question very clear. [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=1543.0s)]
*  So there was a lot of that. [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=1555.0s)]
*  You know, all those things kind of happening at once, I guess. [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=1558.0s)]
*  And then and then also you're like, well, people can make their choices about things. [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=1561.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=1570.0s)]
*  So sometimes if you just have a conversation with people, they'll derive from it when they hear the person speak. [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=1571.0s)]
*  They might be like, OK, I believe this person or I don't believe this person or I empathize or I sympathize or I understand this person or wow, I'm surprised by that person. [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=1578.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=1590.0s)]
*  Or people. [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=1591.0s)]
*  So sometimes I think that that's kind of what a podcast is a lot of times as opposed to like an interview. [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=1592.0s)]
*  It's just a space where people talk and then people can devise their own thoughts about the conversation. [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=1600.0s)]
*  And I'm not trying to take any skin off of my own neck as a as a as being an interviewer. [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=1608.0s)]
*  But then it's like, well, is this an interview or is it a podcast? [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=1615.0s)]
*  So there's all you know, there's just like little things I think that I'm just kind of still learning and navigating and and just how to have a voice in those spaces. [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=1618.0s)]
*  You know, I think that I could have joked less. [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=1627.0s)]
*  And but then you get into this space. [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=1630.0s)]
*  Well, do I have a responsibility like a social or societal responsibility to ask certain things? [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=1632.0s)]
*  But that's very scary because then it's like, oh, that's like ego. [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=1639.0s)]
*  You know, that's like, well, do I mean, you know, you know, you have to be careful that you're just not getting into this ego place. [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=1646.0s)]
*  So, yeah, I don't know. [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=1655.0s)]
*  I feel scared. [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=1656.0s)]
*  I don't know if I'm just be having a little bit extra Celsius today. [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=1657.0s)]
*  But yes, so there was just a lot going on. [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=1660.0s)]
*  I do feel like I could have done a better job. [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=1663.0s)]
*  I definitely feel like I live and learn. [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=1665.0s)]
*  I think there were a lot of like little things in there, but I'm grateful to have had that opportunity. [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=1668.0s)]
*  And, you know, I hope to be able to do better in certain instances in the future and and get the questions in that I want to that I do feel like are important. [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=1673.0s)]
*  Anyway, I don't want to lament over it too much or like overlook at it too much. [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=1682.0s)]
*  But those are the smart thoughts, you know, and you can think whatever you want. [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=1687.0s)]
*  You may have hated even him sitting in there. [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=1691.0s)]
*  You know, you might not be, you know, he might not be your cup of tea, you know. [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=1693.0s)]
*  Anyway, so, yeah, that's kind of I get. [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=1703.0s)]
*  Yeah, I'm just rambling about that shit now. [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=1707.0s)]
*  But that was something that's on my mind. [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=1709.0s)]
*  You know, I wish it and I wish I'd have spoken up more and had another couple of follow up questions about the Middle East. [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=1711.0s)]
*  And it's OK. I'm not going to get down on myself, but I want to be able to just I want to do my best. [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=1717.0s)]

*  Let's take another call here. [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=1841.0s)]
*  Thank you. I just wanted to get your thoughts on a topic regarding what's going on with the ICE raids down in LA. [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=1844.0s)]
*  I was a victim of a sexual assault when I was in college and I never got to go to trial or any of that because I never reported it. [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=1853.0s)]
*  Thank you for sharing that. I'm sorry to hear that. Thank you for sharing. Onward. [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=1863.0s)]
*  Anyways, I was just thinking about in this country how there's, I mean, I don't know, at least 25,000 rape kits sitting in evidence lockers that are not tested. [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=1869.0s)]
*  And that while this is happening, people are being pulled from their families. [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=1882.0s)]
*  And that's what our country has decided to spend their money on. [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=1888.0s)]
*  What do you think about that? Do you really think that there is value in what our government is choosing to do? [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=1891.0s)]
*  Do you think that the citizens of this country who have actually committed crimes are better than people who have existed illegally, you know, doing, picking fruit, like having families, like being good people? [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=1899.0s)]
*  Like, I know you love Mexicans. I love Mexicans. Like they are like how mad are all the whole food bombs going to be when they can't afford strawberries? Like, this is hilarious to me. [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=1916.0s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, there's a lot here. Sorry, there's a lot in this voicemail. Yeah, I love Mexicans. I would like to be Mexican next time. [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=1930.0s)]
*  Next time, I've prayed for that. God knows that. So if something ever happens to me, please look out for me. And if you see me in El Barrio, say, bienvenidos de Adoro. [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=1938.0s)]
*  But yeah, sorry to kind of joke, but you were kind of laughing there at the end as well. Yeah, I'm sorry about your sexual assault. I don't. [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=1955.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's heartbreaking. It's heartbreaking what? Let me look up about those rape kits. I didn't even know that. [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=1962.0s)]
*  How many rape kits are awaiting testing in the US? [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=1974.0s)]
*  This is a site called USAFacts.org. [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=1977.0s)]
*  It also can connect perpetrators to other assaults. Unreal. Yeah, I was not even aware of that. Thank you for bringing that to our attention. [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=2007.0s)]
*  I'm always mesmerized by what our country appears to do with funding. When I was a kid, I know my mother was like, why are we sending this money to these other places? [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=2018.0s)]
*  There's always been this situation like, why are we sending? Why? What do we need over here? With this money we're sending to Israel, we could do so many things, right? [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=2029.0s)]
*  And I just picked that place because it's the one that I think we sent them $12 billion already this year. [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=2045.0s)]
*  But yeah, why? Why? Right? Why? And knowing that people are sitting there waiting, the stress of waiting for a kid like this to come back, I just can't even fathom. [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=2051.0s)]
*  While the perpetrators out there may be doing more crimes, the alleged perpetrators out there doing more crimes. [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=2066.0s)]
*  But let's talk about the ICE situation. You know, because I feel like that was more the focal point of your call. [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=2071.0s)]
*  I think a lot of things on this. So one, I think a lot of what you see, not a lot, I would say I bet half of what you see, the videos and stuff out of Los Angeles are not real. [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=2079.0s)]
*  I think a lot of them are seeds that are planted to create conflict, right? To create more videos, you know, caring people show up, caring for a cause, they create more videos. [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=2091.0s)]
*  And then there's all this extra videography. But I believe that the whatever you would call it, the Duralog, whatever starts that, that that is kind of staged. [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=2102.0s)]
*  I feel like even a lot of the videos are probably staged. Not saying all of them. I'm not saying that deportations aren't happening. I'm not saying any of that. [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=2112.0s)]
*  I just don't trust things that a lot of some of the a lot of the stuff in Los Angeles, I believe that that a lot of things in our world are staged. [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=2119.0s)]
*  And then we see videos and then we believe them. I believe them. You believe them. We believe them. [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=2129.0s)]
*  Obviously, there's a lot of deportations going on. It's sick when you see like children crying and people being taken from their parents. It's heartbreaking. [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=2134.0s)]
*  It's you know, it's it's it's it. Anybody thinks that that's heartbreaking. [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=2143.0s)]
*  Now, there's also in the country, there's, you know, you have rules, you have laws, you have like these are the rules, right? [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=2151.0s)]
*  And some people are here, they're illegal, they're illegal by the letter of the law. Technically, they're undocumented, right? [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=2159.0s)]
*  Now, 40% of people that are here illegally are Mexican, right? 60% are not. [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=2166.0s)]
*  We're just coming off a huge influx of people that were just led into the country during the last political administration. [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=2178.0s)]
*  There's no we've had border patrol agents on it's it's undeniable. A lot of them are not even from Mexico. [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=2187.0s)]
*  A lot of them are not laborers that were just coming over for fruit season or for farming season and then coming back. A lot of them are not that. [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=2192.0s)]
*  So, you know, when Trump is a he's heavy handed, that's who he is, right? [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=2202.0s)]
*  We've also had a broken system for a long time. [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=2208.0s)]
*  So when the hammer starts to come down or the guillotine as this is, it's not going to be comfortable. [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=2212.0s)]
*  And at first, it's going to be messy. It's not going to be smooth. [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=2223.0s)]
*  And I think that and I know Trump spoke the other day that there needs to be a way and I believe wholeheartedly there needs to be a way where people who are productive citizens [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=2228.0s)]
*  are allowed to get amnesty or create a path for them to have citizenship. [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=2238.0s)]
*  I believe that undeniably. [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=2246.0s)]
*  There's also people who are like, well, when someone says that they shouldn't be in our country, right? [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=2249.0s)]
*  You hear that they shouldn't be in our country. Well, you know, this or this is our land, right? [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=2254.0s)]
*  This I believe that that our land is still that America is still fully entrenched by the ghosts of pain from what happened to Native American people. [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=2258.0s)]
*  I believe that. Right. I believe that the land doesn't forget. [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=2270.0s)]
*  I believe that I don't believe that we've made amends to those situations. [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=2276.0s)]
*  I think there's other situations in history that we haven't made amends to. [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=2281.0s)]
*  I believe that at the same time, like I believe and this is a bigger belief that in a few years, there's this plan with it was spoken a few weeks ago that Trump picked this company Palantir to create this digital database, right? [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=2285.0s)]
*  This to use like AI technologies, create this whole database of everything. [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=2305.0s)]
*  I had asked JD Vance about it. [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=2308.0s)]
*  So I believe in a few years in America that everywhere you go, there's going to be facial recognition. [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=2310.0s)]
*  They're going to be that's just going to be all built into our society. [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=2316.0s)]
*  Right. I mean, built in. [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=2320.0s)]
*  So I don't think in a few years you would even be able to be in the country. [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=2322.0s)]
*  If you're not supposed to be by law, right? [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=2328.0s)]
*  By the letter of the law, I don't even think it's going to be possible. [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=2331.0s)]
*  I think that's where we're headed and we're headed there quick. [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=2334.0s)]
*  And I think this is just one of the early stair steps you see of that. [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=2337.0s)]
*  Right. Is the organization, the documentation, everybody. [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=2341.0s)]
*  You have to know who's here. [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=2345.0s)]
*  You have to. And I don't think I think in a few years it's you're it's not going to matter. [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=2347.0s)]
*  The system will know. [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=2353.0s)]
*  Right. I think it's Palantir is the company that's going to do it. [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=2355.0s)]
*  They've also been accused of a lot of dangerous stuff in Gaza. [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=2358.0s)]
*  But that's that's the company that's we're going to be surveilling basically ourselves. [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=2361.0s)]
*  Right. We as citizens, whoever we are, are going to be under surveillance in our own country. [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=2366.0s)]
*  That's going to be bonkers, dude. [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=2371.0s)]
*  So I believe that it's a bigger thing that that these are the stairs. [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=2373.0s)]
*  These are the baby steps of it is first is you got to know who's here. [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=2379.0s)]
*  You got to figure everything out. [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=2382.0s)]
*  And yeah, I agree. [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=2384.0s)]
*  The stuff's gross. It's sick. [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=2387.0s)]
*  It's it's heartbreaking. [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=2389.0s)]
*  You know, the stuff in Gaza's heartbreaking us watching this and becoming immune to some of the or not. [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=2392.0s)]
*  You know, and then you're so overwhelmed. [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=2398.0s)]
*  Sometimes you don't even know what to speak up about. [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=2400.0s)]
*  And you still also most people have to take care of their families and and get to school or worry about this or worry about that or do OK at their job. [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=2402.0s)]
*  You know, that's a big thing. [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=2409.0s)]
*  And then some people just stay out of it and they just go on about their lives. [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=2411.0s)]
*  And are they are they bad for doing that? [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=2414.0s)]
*  I don't think you know, I don't think so. [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=2417.0s)]
*  That's just it's all a lot. [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=2419.0s)]
*  It's all a lot. [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=2422.0s)]
*  That's what it feels like sometimes. [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=2423.0s)]
*  You know, it feels tough. [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=2425.0s)]
*  It feels tough to navigate. [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=2428.0s)]
*  What do I do? [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=2429.0s)]
*  How do I do this? [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=2430.0s)]
*  You know, but we feel we see the things that we're going to be doing. [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=2431.0s)]
*  We're going to be doing things that we're going to be doing. [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=2434.0s)]
*  We're going to be doing things that we're going to be doing. [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=2436.0s)]
*  How do I do this? [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=2438.0s)]
*  You know, but we feel we see and we feel everything now. [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=2439.0s)]
*  So emotionally, I think a lot of shit gets pretty overwhelming at times or we just start to get immune to it, which is even scarier because then you see something really messed up and you don't even say anything. [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=2442.0s)]
*  You literally move past it with your thumb. [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=2453.0s)]
*  So anyway, sorry to be a downer right there with a lot of downer stuff. [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=2457.0s)]
*  There's also people that have been in the country, technically illegal, right? [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=2462.0s)]
*  Like by the letter of the law, whom I don't know if over the years they've had the opportunity to figure that out. [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=2466.0s)]
*  Is there, you know, have there been opportunities? [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=2473.0s)]
*  I don't know enough about it. [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=2476.0s)]
*  I'm not an I don't know enough about immigration policy to know if they've had where they could go to an office and get that figured out over the years. [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=2477.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=2486.0s)]
*  I don't know what that's like. [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=2487.0s)]
*  I bet it's also miserable to be like living in the shadows and like worried all the time that this isn't going to be able to get figured out or this won't be able to be figured out. [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=2489.0s)]
*  And you also have to believe that different political parties, they will use these things as kickball. [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=2500.0s)]
*  They'll use certain videos and stuff as kickballs to get us all to watch the ball in the air. [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=2504.0s)]
*  Right. And even though sometimes it's some of the situations we're watching, you're watching the monkey juggle. [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=2510.0s)]
*  Meanwhile, the monkey stealing all your shit. [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=2515.0s)]
*  The monkey gots all your bananas, baby. [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=2518.0s)]
*  You down fruitless. You down bad. [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=2521.0s)]
*  Um. [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=2524.0s)]
*  But. [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=2526.0s)]
*  Prayers. If a Mexican person needs to hide at my house, man, I'd be willing to discuss it. [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=2529.0s)]
*  Fuck. I don't know if I should say that out loud or not. [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=2533.0s)]
*  But yeah, I just and sometimes people like you got to speak about you got to speak about this. [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=2538.0s)]
*  You use you. You speak what you feel you need to speak about. [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=2545.0s)]
*  OK, you you speak what you think you need to speak about. [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=2550.0s)]
*  Because also, I don't sit there all day looking at every you know, I'll sit there all day looking at every single thing in moment. [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=2556.0s)]
*  Some stuff I'm not even attuned to. There's other genocides happening in the world that I don't even know about. [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=2563.0s)]
*  Right. And that you don't even know about. And that's OK. You know. [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=2569.0s)]
*  So anyway, there's a lot going on there. [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=2572.0s)]
*  That's all I'm saying. And I think this is all part of a bigger. [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=2575.0s)]
*  This is this is just the beginning step. This isn't. [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=2580.0s)]
*  While we're all watching this, so many other things are going on. [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=2583.0s)]
*  And the crazy part about all of everything is of everything is that it's always the same shit. [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=2587.0s)]
*  You look it's always like, oh, here's a racial issue. Here's a this issue. [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=2593.0s)]
*  And. And nothing ever changes, it feels like. [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=2596.0s)]
*  Nothing ever changes. [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=2601.0s)]
*  And that's sometimes I think maybe even with that Vance interview, I'd be like, is anything going to change? [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=2605.0s)]
*  Because if not, just tell us it's not, you know. [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=2612.0s)]
*  So, you know, I can go back to using and doing adult kickball or whatever, just, you know. [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=2616.0s)]
*  But anyway, those are just some thoughts. [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=2623.0s)]
*  And I don't have any perfect answer for you. [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=2626.0s)]
*  And if you come in to me for some perfect answer, go to yourself. [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=2628.0s)]
*  What is your thought? What do you feel? What do you know? [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=2632.0s)]
*  You you a magic guy. You a wizard. [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=2635.0s)]
*  Then do wizard shit. Another call that came in here. [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=2640.0s)]
*  Sorry to get hot. Happy Belated Father's Day, dude. [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=2644.0s)]
*  And El Dia de las Papa. [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=2648.0s)]
*  Hey, Theo, I just had a question. [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=2650.0s)]
*  I need some advice. I have a pretty right leaning boyfriend and he's not super fond of gay people. [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=2653.0s)]
*  And my really close cousin, like a brother to me, he just came out as gay recently and he's been acting pretty gay. [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=2664.0s)]
*  So I'm just trying to figure out how I can mend things between them. [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=2673.0s)]
*  He's my gay cousin is coming into town. [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=2677.0s)]
*  I'm trying to set up some plans. [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=2680.0s)]
*  Well, look, I think I wouldn't just take a gay around somebody that's anti gay for, you know, like, you know what I'm saying? [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=2683.0s)]
*  Like, you don't fucking you don't just take a pit bull in a bird shop. [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=2690.0s)]
*  So that's one thing I wouldn't do right there. [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=2697.0s)]
*  I mean, you know, I think I mean, you could just play it play a dude. [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=2703.0s)]
*  You could play that song. I'm going to take my horse to the old town road. [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=2709.0s)]
*  I'm going to ride to like, you know, I got the horses in the back. [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=2714.0s)]
*  You play that shit, but I bet they both go fucking grin a little boy. [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=2719.0s)]
*  And if you ain't ready to go full not little not you can fucking start off a little cotton. [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=2725.0s)]
*  I Joe get out the way of Katnip Joe. [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=2730.0s)]
*  That's a fucking little you know, that's a fucking little you know, sometimes if you if they drop that on at the country club, you could see who might have a little bit of fucking zest in a in a bandana. [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=2734.0s)]
*  You know, so yeah, those are some options. [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=2744.0s)]
*  But don't be you know what I'm saying? You ain't fucking Don King. [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=2747.0s)]
*  You ain't Dana White, baby girl. [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=2749.0s)]
*  Don't be out there. You know, don't be out there trying to start a trans women event or something. [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=2751.0s)]
*  You know, I'm saying don't get crazy. You know, you ain't the NCAA. [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=2759.0s)]
*  Don't try to fucking pit different people against each other just to start shit. [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=2762.0s)]
*  You know, don't get like that. [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=2767.0s)]
*  So blessings to both of them. [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=2769.0s)]
*  And praise God right there. [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=2772.0s)]

*  I haven't told a lot of people. [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=2797.0s)]
*  And I want to figure out how I can tell my mom. [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=2800.0s)]
*  And I thought I could get some advice on here. [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=2803.0s)]
*  I am hope I'm hoping she'll listen and maybe find out this way and it'll start out the conversation. [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=2807.0s)]
*  But. [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=2813.0s)]

*  And congratulations on your. [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=2825.0s)]
*  Gay ship or whatever it's called. [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=2828.0s)]
*  Being gay. [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=2831.0s)]
*  I mean, there's different ways you could go about it. [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=2832.0s)]
*  You could do something, you know, kind of fun. [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=2836.0s)]
*  You could do this like a knock knock. [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=2838.0s)]
*  Who's there? [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=2840.0s)]
*  I'm gay. [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=2842.0s)]
*  You know, that old trick or whatever. [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=2843.0s)]
*  Or you could get a deck of cards, right? [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=2846.0s)]
*  You could write. [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=2848.0s)]
*  I'm a gay son on each one. [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=2849.0s)]
*  Put them like that. [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=2853.0s)]
*  However, pick one out, say pick one out and read it. [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=2855.0s)]
*  And bam, you don't even say nothing. [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=2858.0s)]
*  She says it. [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=2860.0s)]
*  And then you could be like, what the fuck do you mean? [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=2862.0s)]
*  You know, you could roll switch or whatever. [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=2865.0s)]
*  So that's it. You know, that's reverse psychology, dude. [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=2868.0s)]
*  So that's something that's crazy. [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=2871.0s)]
*  But I think in reality, dude, what would I do here, dude? [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=2874.0s)]
*  I would I would sit down with her. [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=2879.0s)]
*  I would sit down with your mom if you got to tell her that you are. [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=2881.0s)]
*  I would sit down with her. [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=2886.0s)]
*  I would say, Mom, I have something really important to tell you. [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=2888.0s)]
*  And just ask her. [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=2891.0s)]
*  I would say, hey, do you know, do you love me no matter what? [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=2894.0s)]
*  Do you love me no matter what? [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=2897.0s)]
*  And she will say yes. [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=2900.0s)]
*  Right. If she doesn't say yes, I would not tell her. [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=2902.0s)]
*  But if she says yes, then I would keep moving forward. [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=2904.0s)]
*  And then I would just tell her, say, look, I'm a you know, I'm a gay man or whatever. [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=2909.0s)]
*  Or I'm pretty much gay. [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=2914.0s)]
*  That's what I would say. Don't ever fully commit to anything. [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=2917.0s)]
*  That's a trap for everything. [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=2919.0s)]
*  I'm pretty much gay. Right. [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=2921.0s)]
*  That way, what if they come out with a cream or something or a topical a few years from now or something or you know, [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=2923.0s)]
*  because you don't know that they don't or a peptide or something that be un-gay and people you want to have. [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=2930.0s)]
*  You just want to have that little you want to leave that door ajar, baby. [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=2935.0s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=2939.0s)]
*  You want to leave that you want to leave that door ajar. [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=2940.0s)]
*  You want to leave that door ajar, puppy. [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=2943.0s)]
*  So that's what I would then I would just tell her. [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=2945.0s)]
*  And I would just let her know if it's scary to you to say that. [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=2949.0s)]
*  I would say, Mom, I've been really scared about saying it to you. [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=2952.0s)]
*  And then I would say, do you have any questions about it? [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=2955.0s)]
*  Because it's a surprise. It might be a surprise to her. [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=2959.0s)]
*  Some moms are surprised about it. [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=2963.0s)]
*  What percentage of moms? [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=2965.0s)]
*  No, they have a gaze. [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=2967.0s)]
*  Oh, it says a lot of parents know because they study their babies closely as they grow. [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=2971.0s)]
*  So hell yeah, bro. [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=2978.0s)]
*  Yeah. So if they they might have some ideas over the years. [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=2982.0s)]
*  If you invite another little dudes up in your crib or whatever, they might have had an idea or whatever. [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=2986.0s)]
*  Or you got fucking you got a bedazzled diaper or whatever. [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=2992.0s)]
*  They're going to have a little winkling. Some parents, it doesn't say every parent. [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=2995.0s)]
*  So then that's what I would ask her because it's going to be new to her. [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=2999.0s)]
*  So she might have questions. She might be scared, too. [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=3003.0s)]
*  She might be, you know, she might be kind of rattled. [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=3005.0s)]
*  And then if you guys have a dad, I would say, well, how do we break this to dad? [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=3007.0s)]
*  What do you think we should do? [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=3011.0s)]
*  And then that way it kind of creates a little bit of an accomplice there. [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=3012.0s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, I just think that's it. [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=3015.0s)]
*  That just as probably learning you were gay, it's probably a journey for them to have this information. [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=3017.0s)]
*  So I'm not saying that just because that people need to adapt to you or anything. [[00:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=3023.0s)]
*  But I'm just saying some people, it's a bit of a surprise. [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=3028.0s)]
*  You know, my buddy told me he was gay not long ago and I was like, damn, bro, he's gay, you know. [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=3032.0s)]
*  So it's a surprise sometimes to people. [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=3039.0s)]
*  You don't you know, it's a little bit of an adjustment. [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=3042.0s)]
*  It's not bad or anything or it doesn't mean anybody's bad. [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=3045.0s)]
*  But thanks for asking about that, man. [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=3049.0s)]
*  We've learned a lot about gays here over the years. [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=3051.0s)]
*  We've learned a lot about drug induced homosexuality, altitude based gays, weekend gays, footwear gays. [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=3054.0s)]
*  A lot of times you're looking at your buddy's shoes or whatever and you're like, damn, your boots is gay as fuck, son. [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=3066.0s)]
*  You'd hear come the zest step. [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=3074.0s)]
*  You know, so it's like we've learned a lot about it, dude. [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=3076.0s)]
*  There's full time, there's part time, there's Wednesday only gays, underwater gays. [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=3079.0s)]
*  Sometimes you feel something underwater, you go down there, somebody's blowing you. [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=3086.0s)]
*  What is that? [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=3091.0s)]
*  So there's a lot there, man. [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=3093.0s)]
*  Anyway, sorry to ramble, but I bet I bet. [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=3095.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=3103.0s)]
*  I bet that's a tough, tough experience for a lot of people, man. [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=3104.0s)]
*  I bet it's a tough experience. [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=3108.0s)]
*  So just thanks for calling and sharing about that. [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=3109.0s)]
*  Let's get another call in here. [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=3111.0s)]
*  Yo, what up, CEO? [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=3114.0s)]
*  This is your boy. [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=3116.0s)]
*  I'm going to keep this one anonymous for obvious reasons here in a bit. [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=3118.0s)]
*  But I just want to give you a call and see if you have any suggestions for me. [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=3124.0s)]
*  This morning I received a message from somebody that I had made love to about two years ago. [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=3129.0s)]
*  And honestly, at one point she, this woman, she was my boss. [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=3141.0s)]
*  She's about 10 years older than me, I believe. [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=3148.0s)]
*  But, okay. [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=3151.0s)]
*  You climb into corporate vagina, brother. [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=3154.0s)]
*  All right. [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=3156.0s)]
*  Onward. [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=3157.0s)]
*  I got a message this morning that she says there's about a 75% chance that her one-year-old daughter is my daughter. [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=3158.0s)]
*  And I asked her, well, what's this other 25% chance? [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=3171.0s)]
*  Is that just a softening of the blow or what? [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=3176.0s)]
*  She's like, yeah, there's a 10% chance that it was my ex. [[00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=3179.0s)]
*  I don't even know if she had a boyfriend at the time when we did it, but maybe. [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=3188.0s)]
*  But yeah, it was just kind of softening the blow. [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=3195.0s)]
*  And so obviously I'm going to do a paternity test. [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=3198.0s)]
*  But I'm 25 years old. [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=3201.0s)]
*  She lives in a different state, thousands of miles away from me. [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=3203.0s)]
*  I asked her what she would expect if I am the father, and she says I'm not planning on changing anything. [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=3209.0s)]
*  It's up to me. [[00:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=3217.0s)]
*  But she's going to be happy, healthy, and well taken care of, which I truly do believe. [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=3220.0s)]
*  But I don't know. [[00:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=3227.0s)]
*  I just don't know what to do. [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=3228.0s)]
*  I feel like I myself had both parents growing up, and I'm fucked up as is. [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=3229.0s)]
*  And I can't imagine bringing a baby into this world and just leaving her out there high and dry without a father. [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=3236.0s)]
*  Yeah, you say you can't imagine that, right? [[00:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=3246.0s)]
*  So it sounds like from hearing you that that's not part of you. [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=3250.0s)]
*  That's not part of the plan that you want. [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=3255.0s)]
*  So I think starting from there, you'll be able to figure this out, man. [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=3260.0s)]
*  I wish I had more of a suggestion to you. [[00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=3265.0s)]
*  Actually, I'm going to open this up just to callers. [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=3267.0s)]
*  I know maybe that's impersonal because it's your call, but I think this is important. [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=3269.0s)]
*  If somebody's in this situation, if you've been in this situation before, what did you do? [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=3275.0s)]
*  And if you made mistakes and you were in this situation, what were those mistakes? [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=3281.0s)]
*  I think this is an opportunity to share those. [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=3288.0s)]
*  And we can do a follow up call on the next solo episode where we'll package some of those answers up for you. [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=3291.0s)]
*  But just hang in there right now, man. [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=3300.0s)]
*  Hang in there. [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=3302.0s)]
*  Take care of yourself. [[00:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=3303.0s)]
*  And I would just try to also live in like, you know, get information. [[00:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=3306.0s)]
*  So you're gathering, you know, you have real time information. [[00:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=3309.0s)]
*  What's going on? Is this really, you know, if you have a paternity test, is that really your child? [[00:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=3311.0s)]
*  You know, figure those things out so that you can be at least operating from a place of real information. [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=3315.0s)]
*  And then you're not just living in your head as much. [[00:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=3321.0s)]
*  But I can't tell you a ton because I don't have experience right there. [[00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=3325.0s)]
*  But I have had experience thinking that I might have had someone who's pregnant and that can be very tough. [[00:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=3332.0s)]
*  It can be scary. It can be very scary. [[00:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=3337.0s)]
*  Even if that person's a great person, it still can be very scary. [[00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=3339.0s)]
*  And especially if you're going to be in a place that's far away. [[00:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=3343.0s)]
*  But everything is...if there's a problem, you can usually fix it, right? [[00:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=3346.0s)]
*  If there's a situation, you can usually figure it out. [[00:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=3353.0s)]
*  So even by calling, man, I think it shows kind of where you're at. [[00:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=3356.0s)]
*  You're already in a space where you want to start to figure this out, you know, for yourself. [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=3360.0s)]
*  And possibly for your future child. [[00:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=3365.0s)]
*  So, yeah, thank you for calling, man. [[00:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=3367.0s)]
*  And yeah, we'll put some together. [[00:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=3370.0s)]
*  It might be a few weeks before we get that episode out. [[00:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=3371.0s)]
*  Just let you know, it could be a month to that next solo. [[00:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=3375.0s)]
*  But yeah. But love you, bro. [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=3378.0s)]
*  And hang in there. [[00:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=3381.0s)]

*  Did a call on a FaceTime call. [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=3417.0s)]

*  Let's take one more call right here. [[00:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=3462.0s)]
*  What up, Theo? My name is Alex. I'm from Cleveland, Ohio. [[00:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=3465.0s)]
*  Okay. OH. [[00:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=3469.0s)]
*  Oh yeah. Dancing. [[00:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=3496.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=3499.0s)]
*  Yeah. I would just, thanks for that call, man. [[00:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=3521.0s)]
*  Here's what I would do. I would just take her on another date. [[00:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=3523.0s)]
*  And she already knows that that happened, right? [[00:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=3527.0s)]
*  So I don't think you got to replicate that. [[00:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=3530.0s)]
*  I think you take her to do something else to take that pressure off. [[00:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=3533.0s)]
*  Go for a walk. Go to a bingo hall and do a bingo night over there. [[00:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=3536.0s)]
*  What else could you do? Go for lunch, right? [[00:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=3542.0s)]
*  Do a completely different environment. [[00:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=3545.0s)]
*  Because I've done this a lot in my life, man. [[00:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=3549.0s)]
*  It's like, man, if this date with this girl, if it's not perfect, I don't understand a chance with her. [[00:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=3552.0s)]
*  I either do or don't stand a chance based on who I am though. [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=3556.0s)]
*  I mean, it's easy for me to say that. [[00:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=3560.0s)]
*  Just because like I've learned that in my own life. [[00:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=3563.0s)]
*  But that's really what it comes down to. [[00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=3567.0s)]
*  Just say, hey, the other night felt awesome. Felt magical, right? [[00:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=3572.0s)]
*  I'm nervous. I can't replicate that. [[00:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=3576.0s)]
*  Tell her that right out of the jump. [[00:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=3579.0s)]
*  Now you already have that magic night you made. [[00:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=3581.0s)]
*  And now you're a real guy. You're right there. [[00:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=3585.0s)]
*  You're on a real space. [[00:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=3587.0s)]
*  Because otherwise, dude, we spend this time, dude, I spent so much time. [[00:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=3589.0s)]
*  This has to be perfect. I'm going to fucking get this. [[00:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=3593.0s)]
*  I'm going to rent this van or whatever. I'm going to do all this shit. [[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=3596.0s)]
*  You know, we're going to get a couple of oysters or whatever. [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=3600.0s)]
*  You know, all of this fucking shit, this van oyster bullshit. [[01:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=3604.0s)]
*  And then I end up, I can't ever nothing's purchased. [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=3607.0s)]
*  Like I'm just I've already lost. [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=3610.0s)]
*  I've already lost because I set the expectations too high. [[01:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=3612.0s)]
*  So that's what I would do. Just be real with her. [[01:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=3616.0s)]
*  And if it doesn't work out, it's not because you didn't do things magical. [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=3618.0s)]
*  It's just because we're going to work out. [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=3622.0s)]
*  That's it. You know, do but be creative. [[01:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=3625.0s)]
*  I think that's appreciated. [[01:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=3628.0s)]
*  But that's it, man. [[01:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=3630.0s)]
*  Don't make it so it's impossible for you to even do. [[01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=3632.0s)]
*  You know, I do that sometimes. [[01:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=3636.0s)]
*  Fuck, I make shit like, oh, dear God. [[01:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=3638.0s)]
*  All right, let's get out of this. We got to get done here soon. [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=3642.0s)]
*  Let's take one more call. [[01:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=3647.0s)]
*  Hey, Bill. [[01:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=3650.0s)]
*  I want to congratulate you on your success, man. [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=3653.0s)]
*  I'm a huge fan. [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=3656.0s)]
*  I just had a question, man. Well, not a question. [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=3658.0s)]
*  Just wanted some advice, man. [[01:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=3661.0s)]
*  So I'm 28 years old. [[01:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=3663.0s)]
*  I'm an Army veteran. [[01:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=3666.0s)]
*  Thank you for your service, man. [[01:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=3669.0s)]
*  A veteran recently got out like a year and a half ago. [[01:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=3671.0s)]
*  And I went through a divorce, man. [[01:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=3675.0s)]
*  And, you know, that's that. [[01:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=3678.0s)]
*  The problem is that I have two kids, man. [[01:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=3681.0s)]
*  Both of them have autism. [[01:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=3685.0s)]
*  And mom decided to step away from their life, you know. [[01:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=3687.0s)]
*  And I'm just raising them alone. [[01:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=3691.0s)]
*  I just wonder if you can just give me any advice you got, brother. [[01:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=3694.0s)]
*  Like, just how to deal with that, man. [[01:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=3697.0s)]
*  You know, trying to do things alone. [[01:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=3701.0s)]
*  And he just had any advice, man. [[01:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=3704.0s)]
*  I just want to thank you for your podcast, man. [[01:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=3709.0s)]
*  It's been extremely helpful. [[01:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=3712.0s)]
*  And yeah, thank you. [[01:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=3715.0s)]
*  And hope you reach out back, man. [[01:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=3717.0s)]
*  But thank you for the call, man. [[01:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=3720.0s)]
*  Thanks for calling and just, man, that's a journey you're on, dude. [[01:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=3722.0s)]
*  Congratulations, bro. [[01:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=3727.0s)]
*  Congratulations on, you know, showing up. [[01:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=3730.0s)]
*  But, man, I want to say happy Belated Father's Day to you. [[01:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=3733.0s)]
*  And I applaud you, man. [[01:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=3737.0s)]
*  I applaud you for showing up for those kids. [[01:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=3739.0s)]
*  For being able to have that. [[01:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=3743.0s)]
*  Let them have somebody they can look in the eyes. [[01:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=3745.0s)]
*  And they know that that person is there for them. [[01:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=3748.0s)]
*  That that person is a caretaker. [[01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=3753.0s)]
*  That that person thinks about them when they're not around. [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=3756.0s)]
*  You know, I think as children we take that for granted even. [[01:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=3760.0s)]
*  And we should because it shouldn't even be a question. [[01:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=3763.0s)]
*  But I commend you on that. [[01:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=3767.0s)]
*  I know it's your job as a dad, right? [[01:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=3769.0s)]
*  That's part of it. [[01:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=3771.0s)]
*  But, man, maybe as men we don't say that shit to each other enough. [[01:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=3772.0s)]
*  You know, I don't know. [[01:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=3777.0s)]
*  But, yeah, having dad there when you try to learn to ride the bike or you want to do fishing or whatever. [[01:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=3781.0s)]
*  Or if y'all like doing a video game or reading your kid a story at night. [[01:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=3788.0s)]
*  You know, or even picking your kid up and helping him get to the second or third step. [[01:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=3793.0s)]
*  You know, now make your kid do one of the steps. [[01:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=3798.0s)]
*  Some people put their kid all the way to the fourth step. [[01:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=3800.0s)]
*  Bitch, put that bitch on the third step. [[01:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=3802.0s)]
*  You know, I'm saying, bro, life ain't that easy. [[01:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=3805.0s)]
*  You know, or said if they crawl and set that bitch on the south side of a speed bump, let him work. [[01:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=3808.0s)]
*  Let him work. [[01:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=3814.0s)]
*  But I'll say this. [[01:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=3816.0s)]
*  It makes me feel good just knowing that there's a man out there who is out there battling to do his best with his children. [[01:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=3817.0s)]
*  And this is also kind of interesting. [[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=3824.0s)]
*  We are making these Cat William Nutcrackers. [[01:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=3828.0s)]
*  And we're going to make a packaged pair just like me and Cat William had talked about about doing it. [[01:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=3834.0s)]
*  And they're going to be one of him, one of me. [[01:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=3840.0s)]
*  And you could just get him if you want. [[01:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=3846.0s)]
*  That's fine. I will not be upset. [[01:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=3848.0s)]
*  But we're going to sell him and the proceeds are going to go somehow to help parents of children with autism. [[01:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=3850.0s)]
*  So we just started looking at the prototypes and I don't know what that looks like. [[01:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=3859.0s)]
*  Right. I don't know how. [[01:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=3865.0s)]
*  I don't know if it'll be in what way or something. [[01:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=3866.0s)]
*  But when that comes along, man, maybe I could have you help us out somehow. [[01:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=3869.0s)]
*  I don't know. Maybe we can think of something to do in that space. [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=3875.0s)]
*  But yeah, now we're hoping to have them planned for the end of the year. [[01:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=3880.0s)]
*  I don't know how it all works, but I do know that we've already gotten back like drawings. [[01:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=3885.0s)]
*  We haven't gotten back an actual item yet. [[01:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=3890.0s)]
*  But I do believe that we're making progress. [[01:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=3893.0s)]
*  So there you go. [[01:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=3895.0s)]
*  That'll be something. [[01:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=3898.0s)]
*  That's not advice, but that's my Belated Father's Day gift to you. [[01:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=3899.0s)]
*  Is that if we can get this to fruition, then let me see if I can't find a way that we can or do like do a nice thing for you or something. [[01:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=3903.0s)]
*  I don't know what it is yet. [[01:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=3913.0s)]
*  Yeah, but just know that people are thinking to you, man. [[01:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=3915.0s)]
*  You know, know that I think a lot of us go through the day and you know, I think most people this is the funny thing. [[01:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=3918.0s)]
*  Most people I'll run into, they say I want to be helpful to people. [[01:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=3927.0s)]
*  You know, most people are that's what they are thinking of that. [[01:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=3932.0s)]
*  And I think that's what's in the heart of most people, man. [[01:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=3939.0s)]
*  But happy, happy Belated Father's Day, brother. [[01:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=3943.0s)]
*  And praise God, you might also be Mexican. [[01:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=3946.0s)]
*  So you sounded a little bit Mexican. [[01:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=3949.0s)]
*  I'm judgmental when it comes to voices and shit. [[01:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=3951.0s)]
*  You know that, bro. [[01:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=3953.0s)]
*  But Feliz Papa. [[01:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=3954.0s)]
*  Let me see what that means actually. [[01:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=3957.0s)]
*  Happy Dad. [[01:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=3960.0s)]
*  Happy Father. [[01:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=3964.0s)]
*  So El Dia de Feliz Papa. [[01:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=3966.0s)]
*  Happy Dad's Day Yesterday. [[01:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=3969.0s)]
*  Oh, yesterday. [[01:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=3972.0s)]
*  Yesterday dos. [[01:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=3974.0s)]
*  I'll say that. [[01:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=3976.0s)]
*  Two yesterdays. [[01:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=3977.0s)]
*  Yesterday dos. [[01:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=3978.0s)]
*  El Dia de Feliz Papa. [[01:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=3980.0s)]
*  Ayer dos. [[01:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=3983.0s)]
*  Happy Belated Father's Day to Rhett Powers. [[01:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=3986.0s)]
*  That's the man that took me in when I was young and gave me a place to stay. [[01:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=3990.0s)]
*  You know, in high school and stuff like that and has been a role model to me. [[01:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=3995.0s)]
*  Charles Alder, he was a teacher of mine that I had when I was young. [[01:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=4000.0s)]
*  He passed away a few years ago. [[01:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=4004.0s)]
*  He was like the first person ever even to talk to me. [[01:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=4005.0s)]
*  Talk to me like, I don't know. [[01:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=4010.0s)]
*  He really cared about me. [[01:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=4015.0s)]
*  There's been a lot of men in my life. [[01:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=4020.0s)]
*  I'll forget. [[01:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=4022.0s)]
*  I don't want to get into a naming spree. [[01:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=4023.0s)]
*  And a lot of men who have filled in the blanks. [[01:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=4026.0s)]
*  You know, sometimes I go, if there's something going on, I'll call this friend's dad. [[01:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=4029.0s)]
*  Or I'll call this person who's a little bit older than me. [[01:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=4034.0s)]
*  Sometimes I even get little pieces of fatherhood from friends. [[01:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=4037.0s)]
*  Right? [[01:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=4040.0s)]
*  Yeah, I think sometimes it's like building, you build that relationship inside of other pieces of fathers that are still here or moments that are still here. [[01:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=4041.0s)]
*  So anyway, I'm going to say that. [[01:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=4052.0s)]
*  So anyway. [[01:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=4056.0s)]
*  Just learning to use my voice, dude. [[01:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=4061.0s)]
*  It's crazy. [[01:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=4062.0s)]
*  This late in life. [[01:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=4063.0s)]
*  And maybe that's me just having a cop out. [[01:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=4065.0s)]
*  I have no idea. [[01:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=4068.0s)]
*  But I'm going to keep I'm going to keep showing up. [[01:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=4069.0s)]
*  Let's do that. [[01:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=4072.0s)]
*  Praise God, man. [[01:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=4075.0s)]
*  Be good to yourselves out there. [[01:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=4076.0s)]

*  This is called Death of a Good Man. [[01:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=4141.0s)]
*  Said he always done right by that woman And ain't no man could call him wild [[01:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=4171.0s)]
*  Some nights when his spirit got heavy He'd dream of that lost promised land [[01:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=4181.0s)]
*  Said he'd look like back home in Virginia But he'll never see them o'er hills again [[01:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=4192.0s)]
*  He said I blame it on the damn tobacco And I blame it all on the booze [[01:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=4204.0s)]
*  And I blame it on the fella sitting up in heaven Giving me the right to choose [[01:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=4216.0s)]
*  He said I reckon I'll die on a Tuesday And I hope the sun's gonna shine [[01:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=4226.0s)]
*  And I can't take it with me So I drink it right here My whiskey, my beer, and my wine [[01:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=4239.0s)]
*  And he spoke like a Southern Baptist preacher Sang like a Pentecostal choir [[01:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=4251.0s)]
*  Said he always done right by his mama And ain't no man could call him wild [[01:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=4263.0s)]
*  Some nights when his spirit got heavy He'd dream of that lost promised land [[01:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=4273.0s)]
*  Looked like back home in Virginia He said I'll never see them o'er hills again [[01:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=4285.0s)]
*  And I'd sit at the bar while he's talking Just like me and him was old friends [[01:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=4295.0s)]
*  And promised I'd always remember The life of a good man [[01:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=4306.0s)]
*  Now on the east side of Nashville I sit And I get stoned [[01:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=4319.0s)]
*  Thanks for watching! [[01:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlljgXNRL8s&t=4336.0s)]
