*  That's where it is nowadays, right? [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=141.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=143.12s)]
*  I can't believe that we're able to get platforms. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=144.48000000000002s)]
*  I started in my kitchen, and then it just evolved out of there. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=147.84s)]
*  That's fantastic. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=152.12s)]
*  It's pretty unbelievable. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=153.12s)]
*  Do you want to start? [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=154.12s)]

*  We're good? [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=158.12s)]
*  Yeah, does Barron play sports or anything? [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=159.12s)]
*  He does. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=163.04000000000002s)]
*  He plays golf and different sports, soccer. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=164.04000000000002s)]
*  Loves soccer, very good at soccer. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=167.0s)]
*  He's a good athlete, Barron. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=169.76s)]
*  Has he already picked a college or no? [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=172.51999999999998s)]
*  He has, and he's getting set to go in the fall. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=174.44s)]
*  Good college, a very good one. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=178.48s)]
*  He was always a very good student. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=180.72s)]
*  He's smart, smart guy. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=182.12s)]
*  Which one of your kids, what's something you admire about each one of your sons? [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=184.32s)]
*  Well, Don is a hunter. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=189.72s)]
*  He's a great, great hunter and knows everything about that world and guns and all. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=192.28s)]
*  He was the first one that said, Dad, boy, you got lucky. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=200.64s)]
*  Because I didn't realize that 130 yards is actually very close in that parlance. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=204.84s)]
*  And he said, you got lucky. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=210.16s)]
*  He knew immediately when he saw that. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=212.67999999999998s)]
*  He said, it's incredible because that's considered a pretty close distance. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=215.07999999999998s)]
*  From how far the shooter was? [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=218.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=219.72s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=220.72s)]
*  The guy wasn't a bad shooter, supposedly. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=221.72s)]
*  You know, very disturbed guy, but he wasn't a bad shooter. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=222.72s)]
*  And Eric, likewise, he loves the business. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=228.24s)]
*  He loves real estate. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=230.56s)]
*  Also very much of a hunter and understands a lot of things about that. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=232.68s)]
*  They were sort of as young guys they were with their grandfather, and he would take [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=236.48000000000002s)]
*  them hunting in Czechoslovakia. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=241.08s)]
*  And somehow they developed very well. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=243.8s)]
*  Czechoslovakia? [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=246.12s)]
*  Damn. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=247.12s)]
*  Can you imagine? [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=248.12s)]
*  A lot of letters even. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=249.12s)]
*  That's a long time. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=250.12s)]
*  That's a name you don't hear too much anymore. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=251.12s)]
*  But it was... [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=252.8s)]
*  I need a scope just to get through the spelling of that word. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=253.8s)]
*  Yeah, a lot of people. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=255.96s)]
*  But so he'd go, they'd spend time in Europe and they'd do that. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=258.48s)]
*  That's where he learned a lot about both of them really good. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=262.6s)]
*  With your dad they would go? [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=266.56s)]
*  No, grandfather, actually. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=268.04s)]
*  They had a grandfather who was a wonderful outdoorsman and athlete. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=270.32s)]
*  And during the summer he'd take them out into the woods and they'd go hunting and lots of [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=277.68s)]
*  things and they loved it. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=281.24s)]
*  They got to love it. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=282.32s)]
*  And that's Don and that's Eric. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=283.32s)]
*  Yeah, they're funny. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=285.84s)]
*  They have a good sense of humor too. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=286.84s)]
*  Like whenever I see them at UFC it's like... [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=288.28s)]
*  Yeah, I just like... [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=291.24s)]
*  The first time I was nervous I think and then after that when I've seen them it's like it's [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=292.24s)]
*  fun to kind of cut up with them a little bit. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=295.96s)]
*  Yeah, well they're good guys and they really get along great with the rest of the family. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=298.28s)]
*  We all get along great. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=304.76s)]
*  We have a good family. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=305.76s)]
*  But I love you. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=307.68s)]
*  You talk about a great guy. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=308.68s)]
*  How about Dana White? [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=310.96s)]
*  Good job he does, right? [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=311.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=312.96s)]
*  I want to thank Dana too for helping get us set up together. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=313.96s)]
*  Yeah, he makes it happen. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=316.59999999999997s)]
*  I like Dana. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=318.23999999999995s)]
*  He doesn't waste words. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=321.52s)]
*  He doesn't waste time. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=323.08s)]
*  He likes to, I think, be efficient and he seems like a strong sense of integrity for [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=324.56s)]
*  himself. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=330.35999999999996s)]
*  Yeah, nobody like him actually. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=331.35999999999996s)]
*  You know there's an expression that everybody is replaceable. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=332.35999999999996s)]
*  Not Dana. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=337.47999999999996s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=338.47999999999996s)]
*  Nobody could do what he does and he's made that sport into a big monster sport. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=339.47999999999996s)]
*  And it's interesting and we go there and we enjoy it. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=343.20000000000005s)]
*  Go with him. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=345.72s)]
*  Sometimes we do walk-ons with Dana and the place sort of likes it. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=346.72s)]
*  Oh yeah, I've been there. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=350.56s)]
*  Yeah, but Dana. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=352.08000000000004s)]
*  There's a video of us. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=353.08000000000004s)]
*  I was in behind you in one video. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=354.08000000000004s)]
*  I'm sure the dogs here will pull it up. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=357.24s)]
*  But yeah, those are some of my favorite things ever. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=361.0s)]
*  It became, UFC became my favorite sport during the pandemic because Dana was brave enough [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=363.8s)]

*  it would have been neat if you guys could have been in the same spot, you know. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=617.52s)]
*  But I heard I heard the audio was great. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=620.3199999999999s)]
*  And actually, they put out a clear tape of it because they had clear tape. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=622.92s)]
*  Oh, nice. They had so many millions and millions of people watching, [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=626.0s)]
*  like record numbers of people. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=629.72s)]
*  And I'm trying to figure out we're on a cell phone or I was. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=632.6s)]
*  And, you know, that's a lot of people coming into a cell phone one way or the other. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=636.08s)]
*  Yeah. But I heard some people had a problem with the audio. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=639.72s)]
*  I don't know. I don't do that thing. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=643.6s)]
*  You know, that was done. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=645.08s)]
*  And we had a great conversation. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=645.96s)]
*  It was for two hours and 15 minutes. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=648.56s)]
*  They just put out a clear tape of it, a perfect tape of it. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=650.68s)]
*  But I sounded I think I sounded somebody said [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=654.16s)]
*  your voice was distorted or something. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=659.12s)]
*  And and, you know, I guess it happens. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=661.16s)]
*  Look, it was such a big thing, such a big audience. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=663.28s)]
*  But I would have I would have loved to have seen the clear tape. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=666.28s)]
*  Originally, they put it out right after the show. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=669.36s)]
*  So now it's a clear tape where a perfect tape done there. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=671.28s)]
*  Yeah. But when it goes through different phone systems and everything else, [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=675.08s)]

*  old enough that you would look up to somebody and I'd look up to him anyway. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1056.04s)]
*  Did you admire him? [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1060.84s)]
*  Yeah, I admired a lot so much about him. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1061.8799999999999s)]
*  He had so much going. He had to look. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1064.08s)]
*  He had an unbelievable personality, like an incredible personality. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1067.1999999999998s)]
*  What was his name, Donald? [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1071.76s)]
*  His name was Fred, Fred Trump. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1072.76s)]
*  And he had a problem with alcohol. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1075.28s)]
*  He got addicted to it because it's and you know, they say alcohol is tougher [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1078.6s)]
*  than drugs to get off of. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1083.1599999999999s)]
*  I've I don't know if you've ever heard that. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1084.48s)]
*  I'm in recovery, actually. I've been in I've been in recovery. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1086.16s)]
*  So like most of the last 10 years from alcohol, from drugs and alcohol. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1089.8400000000001s)]
*  Drugs, which is worse for me. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1094.48s)]
*  Drugs is the problem. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1096.72s)]
*  But if I have a drink, then I it's tougher for me to prevent myself from getting. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1097.8s)]
*  It sets off a chain. Yeah. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1102.0800000000002s)]
*  But is which is harder to quit? [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1103.8s)]
*  I've heard alcohol is harder to quit than drugs, if that makes sense. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1105.72s)]
*  I don't know. Oh, yeah. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1110.0s)]
*  I mean, I can only imagine because it's probably more readily available. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1110.88s)]
*  More readily when it's social and you're sitting and everyone's drinking and all. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1113.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1117.36s)]
*  Rarely do you go to a dinner and everybody's eating like, you know, [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1117.6s)]
*  Xanaxes or something, you know, for appetizers. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1120.7199999999998s)]
*  Usually people are having like a mint, you know, a mint julep or something, [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1123.32s)]
*  a little fancier, Negroni. I just learned about. Right. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1126.4399999999998s)]
*  But yeah. So you have a problem with that. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1130.1599999999999s)]
*  Yeah. Oh, wow. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1132.24s)]
*  It's been in my family, my family. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1133.8s)]
*  It's like, yeah. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1135.48s)]
*  Can you stay away from it? Yeah. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1138.0s)]
*  I've done a good job. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1139.76s)]
*  I mean, how long have you been off? [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1140.6399999999999s)]
*  I go to recovery meetings. [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1141.9199999999998s)]
*  I've been off most recently to a little over two years. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1143.24s)]
*  Do you ever go back on? Yeah. [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1146.48s)]
*  I've had stents where I go back on and and you don't control it. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1148.04s)]
*  It's tough. It gets it goes down. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1152.28s)]
*  Okay. So you think it's going to be easy. [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1153.72s)]
*  You think you're controlling it. [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1155.8s)]
*  And then you're damn. Yeah. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1157.52s)]
*  You're doing a go cart and racing with hookers and stuff. [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1158.52s)]
*  It gets bad. It's not to do it. Right. [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1161.6s)]
*  Right. So then in the end, you're like, I have to not do it. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1163.36s)]
*  Did you see like with your brother? [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1165.64s)]
*  Did you could you see it or anything? [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1167.8s)]
*  Oh, yeah. Man. [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1169.96s)]
*  I was amazed because he had so much going and everything going. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1171.76s)]
*  I think he probably it happened in college at a fraternity, maybe. [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1177.44s)]
*  Or I don't know. [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1182.8799999999999s)]
*  It's somewhere along the line. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1183.6s)]
*  It happened. And all of a sudden, you know, this is not unique. [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1184.96s)]
*  This is a very common story, unfortunately. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1188.48s)]
*  But and then the family would see it and start to notice it. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1190.36s)]
*  And it didn't get better. [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1194.4s)]
*  It didn't get better. I was amazed. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1197.76s)]
*  You know, he lived so long in bad conditions, you know, in terms of I was amazed [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1199.44s)]
*  that his body could hold out, it held out and it had bad moments. [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1205.0400000000002s)]
*  And but his body was unbelievably strong that it could that it could withstand this. [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1210.24s)]
*  Yeah, it's a body. It's so resilient. [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1214.96s)]
*  Yeah. You remember the last time that you saw him or spent with him? [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1216.72s)]
*  I do. And I'm sorry to ask you about it. [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1220.16s)]
*  Yeah, I know. Well, you know, the reason it's good talking about it [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1223.48s)]
*  is it might help other people. [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1228.04s)]
*  If it helps one other person, it's worth the conversation. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1229.76s)]
*  We talk about that stuff a lot on our on our podcast. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1232.84s)]
*  Yeah. A lot of our audience struggles or has struggled with [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1235.24s)]
*  alcoholism, addiction, intimacy, disorders, all types of stuff. [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1239.56s)]
*  You know, so it's like a it's pretty kind of normal conversation. [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1243.96s)]
*  But, you know, the interesting thing is and I tell people [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1247.2s)]
*  so I never had a cigarette and I've never had a glass of alcohol. [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1251.1599999999999s)]
*  And my brother was incredible. [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1255.3999999999999s)]
*  He would tell me because he knew he had a problem and he'd say, [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1256.92s)]
*  don't ever drink, don't ever smoke. [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1259.96s)]
*  He'd always had smoking because he did smoke a lot, [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1261.72s)]
*  which is not very healthy. [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1265.1200000000001s)]
*  But he'd say, don't ever drink, don't ever drink. [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1268.0s)]
*  He'd tell me every time I said, don't have a drink because he knew he had this [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1270.5600000000002s)]
*  yeah addiction. [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1273.68s)]
*  And I never had a glass of alcohol, never, ever did I have a glass of alcohol [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1275.3600000000001s)]
*  because of him. [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1280.64s)]
*  And I would say that if I did drink, I could, you know, [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1281.92s)]
*  conceivably be the type of personality that would have like you, [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1284.32s)]
*  that would have a problem. But I never had. [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1288.4399999999998s)]
*  And the only thing I say to people is if too late for the people that you're [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1290.36s)]
*  talking about, but if you don't drink, you don't miss it. [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1294.52s)]
*  I mean, I don't even think about alcohol or. [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1297.8s)]
*  It's not a part of your world. [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1301.36s)]
*  I don't think about cigarettes. I don't think about any of that. [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1302.2s)]
*  If you if you don't take drugs or if you don't have alcohol, [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1305.2s)]
*  it's real easy not to drink it. [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1309.1599999999999s)]
*  It's one I had a friend who went to the Wharton School of Finance with me. [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1311.08s)]
*  He was a very smart guy. [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1315.44s)]
*  Where is it Wharton School? That's in Philadelphia. [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1317.56s)]
*  That's it at Penn. Yeah. Rocky. Right. [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1319.84s)]
*  And it's a great, great school, great business school. [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1322.92s)]
*  And it's part of the University of Pennsylvania, the business school. [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1326.1599999999999s)]
*  Oh, it's nice down there. Yeah. [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1329.96s)]
*  My friend's brother went there or something. [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1331.8s)]
*  Well, he then he was smart because it's a great school. [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1334.12s)]
*  And but this this person that I met, he hated the taste of scotch. [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1337.8s)]
*  He hated it. Couldn't stand it. [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1343.0s)]
*  But he insisted on having it because he wanted. [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1345.6s)]
*  He felt it was important to be able to drink. [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1348.12s)]
*  I said, no, just don't drink. [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1350.8s)]
*  He said, you know, to be successful in business, [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1352.36s)]
*  you have to sort of interact and you have to drink. [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1354.3999999999999s)]
*  And I said, don't do it. [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1356.8s)]
*  Anyway, he became an unbelievable alcoholic, [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1358.36s)]
*  uncontrollable alcoholic. Oh, I think like one of the best. [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1362.76s)]
*  Yeah. And he died. [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1366.12s)]
*  He was, you know, but he hated the taste of scotch. [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1366.96s)]
*  And he still didn't. He couldn't live without it. Wow. [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1370.88s)]
*  Literally. Well, I think I notice a lot of like in the recovery rooms and stuff. [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1373.0s)]
*  It's a lot of people that have they're missing something inside of them. [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1376.52s)]
*  And so they could be they take on like, you know, [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1379.32s)]
*  they want to try and fill it up with something else. [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1382.2s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1384.24s)]
*  Do you remember the last time you spent with your brother? I do. And [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1385.6000000000001s)]
*  he had periods where he'd get sick, very sick. [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1390.52s)]
*  And we thought we'd lose him or we lost him. [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1394.04s)]
*  And he got better. And that happened five or six times. [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1398.52s)]
*  I mean, we thought you lost him. [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1401.88s)]
*  And then he got better. [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1404.24s)]
*  And it was amazing. I mean, he was, you know, [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1406.48s)]
*  certainly very strong in that sense. [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1408.2s)]
*  And I just tell people it's so tragic. [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1410.84s)]
*  Don't drink. Just don't drink. Yeah. [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1415.4s)]
*  And you're not going to have a problem like even you. [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1417.28s)]
*  If you didn't drink, you would never. [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1419.32s)]
*  But you probably maybe wouldn't be successful like you are. [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1420.8s)]
*  You know, it's part of your story. [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1423.36s)]
*  It's helped me a lot. Yeah. [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1424.96s)]
*  Yeah. Because I don't know what would happen, probably. [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1426.6399999999999s)]
*  I think it's just too risky. [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1428.6399999999999s)]
*  It is what's something that you miss about him or like that. [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1431.0s)]
*  Yeah. Like what's something that you miss about him, Fred? [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1433.3999999999999s)]
*  Well, he was wise in a sense. [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1435.96s)]
*  I mean, think of it. [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1437.8799999999999s)]
*  He's got this problem. [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1439.24s)]
*  And it was very important for him to convey to me not to have this problem. [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1440.36s)]
*  And I couldn't have been successful if I had that problem. [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1444.9199999999998s)]
*  Yeah. If I had that problem. [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1447.6799999999998s)]
*  And I think maybe I'm a personality type where I could have had the problem. [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1449.9199999999998s)]
*  If I drank. [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1453.32s)]
*  But if you don't drink, you're never going to have it. [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1454.84s)]
*  I mean, I don't miss when I see somebody light up a cigarette and just [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1456.4399999999998s)]
*  they're in heaven. [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1460.56s)]
*  I don't miss that at all. It's weird. [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1463.28s)]
*  It's so nice. It's very Native American. [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1464.9199999999998s)]
*  Isn't it crazy? Bizarre. [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1466.8799999999999s)]
*  And, you know, I think sometimes our older brothers, they kind of like [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1468.3999999999999s)]
*  they take the speed bumps for us, like as younger brothers [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1471.8799999999999s)]
*  so that we don't have to, you know, I'm saying, does that [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1474.8s)]
*  you know what I'm talking about? [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1476.96s)]
*  I think my brother went through a lot of stuff so that I didn't have to go through it. [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1478.2s)]
*  And then I get to see him and learn. [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1481.08s)]
*  Is he OK now? Yeah, he's doing great now. [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1482.84s)]
*  Yeah, he's doing great now. But it's just it's like, yeah, [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1485.04s)]
*  that's one of the blessings, I think, of having an older brother. [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1487.72s)]
*  Well, you can learn through history, too, whether even if it's not a brother, [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1490.12s)]
*  it's by watching other people. [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1493.08s)]
*  I mean, you can see if you have a friend who's an alcoholic [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1494.52s)]
*  or even just by reading about people, you can learn. [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1497.36s)]
*  Oh, yeah. It doesn't necessarily have to be a brother. [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1500.32s)]
*  But in this case, it was very personal. [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1502.84s)]
*  It was a brother. And I learned not to drink. [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1504.48s)]
*  And I learned not to smoke cigarettes. [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1507.68s)]
*  Now, I don't know that I would have smoked cigarettes. [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1509.3999999999999s)]
*  I probably would have drank. [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1511.4s)]
*  I think, you know, there's no reason not to drink. [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1513.48s)]
*  But I had a reason because he told me, you know, just that was it. [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1516.0800000000002s)]
*  Don't do it. Yeah. Yeah. [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1518.8400000000001s)]
*  That was kind of a blessing then. Huh? Yeah. [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1520.2800000000002s)]
*  And where did you did they? [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1522.24s)]
*  Did you guys ever do anything fun together, like one nice memory that you have with him? [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1524.96s)]
*  He had a great talent for flying. [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1530.0800000000002s)]
*  He was a pilot. Oh, sweet. [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1531.8400000000001s)]
*  And he loved it. And you ever fly with him? [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1533.8000000000002s)]
*  I did. I flow with him. [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1536.0400000000002s)]
*  He was a great pilot and a very talented. [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1537.72s)]
*  Other pilots would come to his house to study with him. [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1540.48s)]
*  Watch him fly. And he was really talented at that. [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1545.2s)]
*  But ultimately, he had to give that because of the alcohol. [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1548.1200000000001s)]
*  He had to give that up, which was a hard thing for him to do. [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1550.72s)]
*  But he had to give that. [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1553.44s)]
*  Election Day is coming up on November 5th. [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1556.0s)]
*  And there's this really cool website, send the vote dot com. [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1559.4s)]
*  That makes it easy to register to vote. [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1564.28s)]
*  It's nonpartisan, which means they don't care who you're voting for. [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1567.2s)]
*  They just want to make sure you can vote. [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1571.3999999999999s)]
*  Head over to send the vote dot com. [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1574.56s)]
*  They'll help you sign up, register and even check if you're good to go. [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1577.84s)]
*  I'll drop a link in the podcast description. [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1582.48s)]
*  Let's all get out there and cast our votes this November. [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1585.44s)]
*  Again, that is send the vote dot com. [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1589.44s)]
*  S.C.N.D. T.H.E. V.O.T.E. dot com. [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1593.0400000000002s)]
*  A.I. might be the most important new computer technology ever. [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1599.48s)]
*  It's storming every industry and literally billions of dollars are being invested. [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1604.24s)]
*  So buckle up. The problem is that A.I. needs a lot of speed and processing power. [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1609.8400000000001s)]
*  So how do you compete with costs spiraling out of control? [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1615.24s)]
*  Well, it's time to upgrade to the next generation on the cloud [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1618.92s)]
*  Oracle Cloud Infrastructure or O.C.I. [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1622.56s)]
*  O.C.I. is a single platform for your infrastructure, database, [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1626.48s)]
*  application development and A.I. needs. [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1630.56s)]
*  O.C.I. has four to eight times the bandwidth of other clouds, [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1633.92s)]
*  offers one consistent price instead of variable regional pricing. [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1638.84s)]
*  And of course, nobody does data better than Oracle. [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1643.32s)]
*  So now you can train your A.I. models at twice the speed [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1646.92s)]
*  and less than half the cost of other clouds. [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1650.48s)]
*  If you want to do more and spin less like Uber and Databricks Mosaic, [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1653.36s)]
*  take a free test drive of O.C.I. at Oracle dot com slash Theo. [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1659.08s)]
*  That's Oracle dot com slash Theo. [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1665.0s)]
*  O.R.A.C.L.E. dot com slash Theo. [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1668.56s)]
*  Yeah, it's crazy. [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1673.9199999999998s)]
*  That's the wildest thing to watch is people losing everything, you know? [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1674.76s)]
*  No, they lose everything and many, many people. [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1677.84s)]
*  And yet in those days, it was a drugs. [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1680.9599999999998s)]
*  It wasn't like don't drink, don't take drugs. [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1683.3999999999999s)]
*  I don't think drugs, I don't even know whether even a factor. [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1685.8799999999999s)]
*  They happened. [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1688.1999999999998s)]
*  Pretty long time ago, but I think in those days, I don't think we're drugs, a factor. [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1690.0s)]
*  You go back 25 years ago, like it is now. [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1694.1999999999998s)]
*  Well, certainly not like now. [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1697.12s)]
*  And yeah, and that actually takes me into something else. [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1698.36s)]
*  I wanted to talk about, like alcohol, alcoholism and addiction [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1700.36s)]
*  is something that's really ramped up, even like you're saying, [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1704.36s)]
*  like in the past 20, 30 years in our country. [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1707.48s)]
*  Right. And during the opioid epidemic, [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1709.72s)]
*  they estimate that like almost 600000 people died. [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1713.72s)]
*  Yeah. And that doesn't even include the broken hearts [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1716.48s)]
*  and the deaths of families and circles of trust. [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1720.0s)]
*  All, you know, just people that lost a brother didn't include the actual [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1724.3600000000001s)]
*  the siblings, you know? [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1727.68s)]
*  And so the ripple effect of that is huge. [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1729.88s)]
*  And there's that there's that Sackler family that pretty much got away with it. [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1733.1200000000001s)]
*  You know, they had a financial slap on the wrist, but we're one of the only [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1736.56s)]
*  countries that allows [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1740.76s)]
*  drug advertisements and pharmaceutical companies to advertise on television. [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1743.6399999999999s)]
*  Like, what do you think is are things that you can do [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1748.08s)]
*  to help curtail that when you get in office? [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1751.6399999999999s)]
*  So well, we did a great job. [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1753.9199999999998s)]
*  We had to make sense or not. Yes, it does make sense. [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1755.48s)]
*  And we had [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1757.9199999999998s)]
*  committees, blue ribbon committees in certain cases, but committees [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1760.3999999999999s)]
*  that would meet the big problem we have is, you know, fentanyl is probably the biggest. [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1764.48s)]
*  Opioid is bad. Opioid is bad, too. [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1769.48s)]
*  Yeah. I think that's bad because everyone thinks, you know, in many cases, [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1772.3600000000001s)]
*  they think they're going to do away with pain. [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1776.5600000000002s)]
*  And literally, the time is so short. [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1780.72s)]
*  If you take it for like two weeks, you're almost addicted to it. [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1783.0800000000002s)]
*  It's incredible when you. Oh, the whole. Yeah. [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1787.0800000000002s)]
*  All of that is horrible. [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1789.0800000000002s)]
*  But why do we allow that? [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1790.28s)]
*  You get addicted. How did. [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1791.6799999999998s)]
*  No, I would just do cocaine. That was really. [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1793.1599999999999s)]
*  Yeah. So not just. Yeah. [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1795.7199999999998s)]
*  That's it. It was down and that's down and dirty. Right. [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1797.9599999999998s)]
*  Yeah. And this is yeah. [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1800.9199999999998s)]
*  I mean, it was. Yeah. [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1802.08s)]
*  But you don't anymore. [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1803.08s)]
*  No, I don't do it anymore, man. [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1804.1599999999999s)]
*  And I'm not doing it. Is it too much? [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1805.4399999999998s)]
*  Too much to handle? [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1806.9199999999998s)]
*  Some of this stuff started to get a real rattle in it, too. [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1807.8s)]
*  I don't know where we were even getting it from in this country. [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1810.48s)]
*  But yeah, it started to make me feel like I was a mechanic or so. [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1813.1599999999999s)]
*  The thing you go back to then is alcohol for the most part. Right. Yeah. [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1816.52s)]
*  But what I want probably is cocaine. [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1820.0s)]
*  But I know that if I have a drink, then it'll give me it'll like the like, OK, [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1822.0s)]
*  well, I had a drink and I can do this. [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1825.64s)]
*  Is cocaine a stronger? [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1827.52s)]
*  Oh, yeah. Up. Yeah. [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1830.32s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. So you're way up with cocaine more than anything else. [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1832.04s)]
*  You can think of. [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1836.0s)]
*  OK, I'll turn you into a damn owl, homie. [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1836.6000000000001s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? It'll you'll be you'll be out on your own porch. [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1838.52s)]
*  You know, you'll you'll be your own street lamp. You're freaking. [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1841.92s)]
*  And is that a good feeling? Well, no, it's a miserable feeling. [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1845.48s)]
*  But you do it anyway, just like the guy you're saying with the Scotch. [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1848.84s)]
*  Like you did. You didn't. [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1851.72s)]
*  You knew it was bad, but you still. [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1853.04s)]
*  So it's not even good during what would be normally the good time. [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1855.32s)]
*  In other words. Oh, well. [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1858.84s)]
*  So why would you do it? I wouldn't. That's why I don't. [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1860.3999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, that's that's. [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1863.28s)]
*  But it's crazy because that's what alcoholism is. [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1864.6399999999999s)]
*  I think it's that it trumps the why. [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1867.04s)]
*  Yeah, like it doesn't. [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1869.8799999999999s)]
*  And it just you don't. [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1871.9599999999998s)]
*  And you just go to it's like so that's why they say that it's [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1874.56s)]
*  cunning, baffling and powerful. [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1878.44s)]
*  That's what they say about alcoholism. And it is it's it's. [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1880.0s)]
*  Which is a bigger problem in our country, would you say? Opioids. [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1883.4s)]
*  What bigger than alcohol? Oh, for sure. [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1887.68s)]
*  I think it's that's one of the biggest problems. [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1890.16s)]
*  And compare that to fentanyl. [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1891.8s)]
*  Oh, yeah. Well, that's the problem is people are making fake opioids [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1893.76s)]
*  because they can't afford real ones or they're just getting them off the street. [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1896.32s)]
*  And then they put fentanyl in them. [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1899.28s)]
*  Fentanyl is like laced into everything now. It's horrible. [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1901.68s)]
*  It's horrible. Yeah. [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1904.8799999999999s)]
*  They found some in a baby rattle somewhere, I think. [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1905.6399999999999s)]
*  I don't even know where that was. [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1908.28s)]
*  But one of the things I was wanted to ask you about was like, so there's [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1910.7199999999998s)]
*  like the big pharma lobbyists, like there's 1800 [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1913.52s)]
*  big pharma lobbyists in Washington, D.C.. [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1917.52s)]
*  Right. There's only five hundred and thirty five total [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1920.0s)]
*  representatives or senators total. [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1923.84s)]
*  So just the fact that there's this whole other almost drug government [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1926.3999999999999s)]
*  that's there kind of pushing the, you know, pushing agendas and influencing things. [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1930.9599999999998s)]
*  Like, how do we stop that? [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1935.6s)]
*  And it just seems like it's obviously killing people. [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1936.7199999999998s)]
*  Like people are dying. [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1940.08s)]
*  You know, it's like, what do we have to do that our own government won't help us? [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1941.36s)]
*  Well, you have to stop listening to lobbyists. [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1947.1999999999998s)]
*  You know, I was not a big person for lobbyists. [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1949.28s)]
*  And if they have even a little access to like a president or a senator [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1951.8s)]
*  or a congressman or woman or a snake, you get a lot of money. [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1955.7199999999998s)]
*  Yeah. And in some cases, they just take the money. [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1959.6s)]
*  They don't do anything. [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1962.08s)]
*  But you have a lot of lobbyists in Washington pushing [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1962.92s)]
*  and certainly a lot for the for all of the things that we're talking about, [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1967.0s)]
*  including alcohol. [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1970.96s)]
*  The lobbyists are winning. [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1972.44s)]
*  If you are that winning, they're making a lot of money. [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1973.3600000000001s)]
*  Absolutely. Can you stop that? [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1975.24s)]
*  Can a can a president stop that? [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1977.24s)]
*  Like, how do we stop that? [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1978.8000000000002s)]
*  Well, one way you could stop it is to say if you're going to go into government, [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1980.96s)]
*  you can never be a lobbyist. [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1984.0800000000002s)]
*  In many cases, they have rules and regulations where you can't do it [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1986.8000000000002s)]
*  for four years, three years, five years, whatever. [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1990.52s)]
*  You mean be a lobbyist after you were elected official? [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1992.76s)]
*  I mean, you could say you could say that if you're an elected official [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1995.32s)]
*  or if you work in government, you can never be a lobbyist. [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=1999.8799999999999s)]
*  You have people that work in government and they give out contracts to the military [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=2004.28s)]
*  and then they leave and they work for them for the people that they're giving out [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=2009.32s)]
*  contracts to. It's exactly what happened with the Sackler family, [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=2012.36s)]
*  with the drug companies. [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=2014.92s)]
*  They hired people that were on the FDA to work for them [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=2016.28s)]
*  so they could loophole the laws. [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=2020.2s)]
*  Yeah. But can we outlaw lobbyists or we can't do that? [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=2021.88s)]
*  Well, there's a whole constitutional thing there. [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=2026.88s)]
*  I mean, can you make somebody never ever go into the business if you're [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=2030.44s)]
*  if you work for government and especially if you're giving out contracts? [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=2034.6000000000001s)]
*  In other words, you're a powerful person within some industry, the Navy, the army, [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=2037.6000000000001s)]
*  any you know, anything. [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=2041.92s)]
*  It could be military procurement, et cetera. [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=2043.28s)]
*  There's a whole thing like the whole question is to [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=2046.1200000000001s)]
*  you give out a contract and then all of a sudden you're working for the person [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=2049.4s)]
*  you gave out the contract to or the company that you gave out the contract to. [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=2052.32s)]
*  Right. It's like you're playing both sides in the net. [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=2056.48s)]
*  Well, it's and it's obviously a problem and it's a big problem. [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=2058.08s)]
*  And we were doing things about it. [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=2061.84s)]
*  But then we had to get down to other business. [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=2063.28s)]
*  We had to solve some. [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=2065.0s)]
*  We had a lot of problems with this country. [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=2066.2s)]
*  A lot of problems. [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=2068.6s)]
*  It's pretty clear that the establishment doesn't like you, I would say. [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=2069.64s)]
*  What do you think? [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=2072.56s)]
*  Well, I think the people like me. [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=2073.48s)]
*  Oh, yeah, the people. [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=2074.96s)]
*  We're leading now in all the polls. [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=2075.72s)]
*  We're leading in Rasmussen just came out a little Rasmussen's a very [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=2077.36s)]
*  highly, highly regarded poll, or we're leaving by like leading by five points. [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=2080.96s)]
*  Rasmussen poll and and others also. [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=2085.08s)]
*  And we're doing well. [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=2089.56s)]
*  But I think the people like me a lot. [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=2091.04s)]
*  You know, we won and then we did. [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=2093.6s)]
*  No doubt. So we won in 2016. [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=2094.96s)]
*  And then we did much better in 2020. [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=2097.7200000000003s)]
*  Much better. Got millions and millions more votes. [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=2099.8s)]
*  And why does the establishment keep trying to sink you? [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=2103.44s)]
*  Like, what is it that they are so afraid of? [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=2106.16s)]
*  In some cases, the things we're talking about right now, they want to [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=2109.12s)]
*  sell product that I'm not interested in. [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=2113.2s)]
*  They want to have certain boats and certain chips and certain planes [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=2115.2s)]
*  and certain everything bought. [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=2119.7999999999997s)]
*  Pharma is another one that's, you know, interesting. [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=2122.56s)]
*  Or do they push back against you, you think? [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=2125.8399999999997s)]
*  Yeah, I think they do. Well, [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=2128.08s)]
*  yeah, I think I think it's pretty obvious that they do in one way. [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=2131.56s)]
*  That's a positive thing politically, because when you can show that they push [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=2134.68s)]
*  back, the voters seem to like it. [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=2137.9199999999996s)]
*  But we have a lot of a lot of popularity. [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=2140.6s)]
*  We have a lot of a lot of people that want to see me come back and win [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=2142.72s)]
*  because we had a great time with the greatest economy in history. [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=2147.24s)]
*  When I was president, we had. [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=2150.52s)]
*  Oh, yeah. I got a boat. [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=2151.96s)]
*  Yeah, we had the best African-American, Hispanic American. [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=2153.7599999999998s)]
*  If you look Asian-American job numbers, women, men, everybody. [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=2157.96s)]
*  We did a we did a lot of good things. [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=2162.2799999999997s)]
*  We cut we cut taxes more than anybody else, including Ronald Reagan. [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=2164.52s)]
*  We cut regulations, which created jobs. [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=2169.08s)]
*  We had a great period of time. [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=2171.64s)]
*  And I think the people wanted back based on what I'm seeing, the people want it back. [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=2173.64s)]
*  One thing that you did recently, we had Bernie Sanders on. [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=2177.92s)]
*  And interesting. [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=2182.0s)]
*  And I know that's very interesting. [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=2183.36s)]
*  Certainly, you guys don't agree on a lot of things, but [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=2186.0s)]
*  I think you both acknowledge how horribly rigged the health care system is [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=2189.64s)]
*  against the American people [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=2193.44s)]
*  because hospitals and insurance companies get away with hiding their prices [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=2196.24s)]
*  from all of us, and literally they can charge whatever they want. [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=2200.64s)]
*  You know, it's like you sign up and say, yes, I'll pay. [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=2204.72s)]
*  You trust the hospital. [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=2207.16s)]
*  But then you get home and the bill is it's whatever, you know, [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=2208.56s)]
*  which pretty much feels like some form of extortion to me. [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=2212.2799999999997s)]
*  That's what it seems like to me. [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=2215.72s)]
*  But you had an executive order where you created a federal rule [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=2217.7599999999998s)]
*  forcing hospitals and insurers to publish all their prices. [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=2222.48s)]
*  Yeah. Right. So that people would be able to know, OK, if an MRI costs [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=2226.2s)]
*  six hundred dollars here and it's five thousand dollars there, [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=2229.52s)]
*  then I can go here and save myself money. [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=2232.52s)]
*  But that hasn't even been enforced. Like hospitals. [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=2235.08s)]
*  Biden got away with it. [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=2238.72s)]
*  Hospitals and insurance companies, they're not in. [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=2239.92s)]
*  They're still not showing their prices. They hated it. [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=2242.04s)]
*  Of course they did. [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=2244.96s)]
*  And because it would would have made it very competitive. [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=2245.84s)]
*  And Biden let it go. He did. [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=2248.7599999999998s)]
*  He never enforced it. [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=2250.64s)]
*  And to get that approved was a big deal. [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=2252.08s)]
*  And that would have brought down the price of of, you know, so many things. [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=2254.4s)]
*  Not only, you know, just care, right? [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=2258.8799999999997s)]
*  Care, physical care, mental care. [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=2261.16s)]
*  That would have brought down the cost of care by 50, 60 percent. [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=2263.72s)]
*  And Biden and Kamala didn't press it. [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=2268.2799999999997s)]
*  It was a big thing to get it. [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=2272.2s)]
*  But I'll be pressing it. [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=2274.3599999999997s)]
*  And because you will be pressing it. Yeah. [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=2275.7599999999998s)]
*  And because I'll be pressing it, there are some people that are vehemently [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=2277.56s)]
*  against it for financial reasons, you know, for money reasons. [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=2280.44s)]
*  But I'll be good at hell. That's insane. [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=2284.16s)]
*  Yeah, no, they know. [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=2286.36s)]
*  Bad people, especially because one of the leading causes of [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=2288.16s)]
*  bankruptcy in America is medical debt. [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=2292.08s)]
*  I mean, it's well, that's crazy. [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=2294.96s)]
*  It's pretty. And I don't even think I made that up either. [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=2297.48s)]
*  No, it's when you think of it. [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=2299.32s)]
*  At first, when you said it, I said, wow. [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=2301.76s)]
*  And then I'm thinking about it. [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=2303.6s)]
*  It's really not a wow. [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=2304.84s)]
*  I understand that. Yeah. [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=2306.44s)]
*  Tremendous lobby, tremendous, powerful lobby. [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=2308.12s)]
*  Well, yeah, because I mean, think about what else is going to put you [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=2311.44s)]
*  medical like in that much of a debt. [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=2313.4s)]
*  It's like I think that's I believe that that's accurate. [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=2315.16s)]
*  Who's behind who's behind the health care? [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=2319.96s)]
*  Insurance, that whole thing, like who's behind it all. [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=2323.4s)]
*  It feels like Chuck Schumer is this kind of like [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=2326.44s)]
*  deviant mastermind back there somewhere. [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=2329.3199999999997s)]
*  Well, he's one of the people that is hurt, and he's one of the people [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=2332.08s)]
*  that keeps the prices high. [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=2335.3199999999997s)]
*  And he's, you know, gets a lot of contributions from [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=2337.28s)]
*  the people on the other side. [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=2341.1200000000003s)]
*  Yeah. And him and plenty of other people, a lot of people. [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=2343.0s)]
*  It's a very powerful lobby. [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=2346.0800000000004s)]
*  But when they want to the most powerful lobby, the lawyer lobby. [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=2347.6800000000003s)]
*  That's that's the and that feeds into that also, you know, it all feeds into it. [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=2350.6800000000003s)]
*  Wait, hold on. Just so I understand, Donald, sorry. [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=2354.0800000000004s)]
*  So that that lobby is a very powerful one. [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=2356.36s)]
*  Yeah. But why do those people want people to suffer, though, [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=2359.7200000000003s)]
*  just so they can make money? Yeah. [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=2362.96s)]
*  That's great. Yeah. [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=2365.72s)]
*  I said it really has to do with money. [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=2366.88s)]
*  That's crazy. How much money do they probably start off? [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=2369.12s)]
*  I say this is terrible. [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=2371.64s)]
*  And then they eventually say, well, but can we just as a country say, hey, [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=2372.84s)]
*  how much OK, you need three million dollars, we'll give you that fuck off. [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=2376.2s)]
*  Yeah. We want to be healthy. Yeah. [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=2380.04s)]
*  But can't we make a deal with those people? [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=2381.7599999999998s)]
*  They're very tough to deal with. [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=2385.2s)]
*  And they've been taken care of by drug companies and others for years. [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=2386.44s)]
*  You know, you have politicians that have been for years being taken care of [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=2389.92s)]
*  by people that make a lot of money [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=2394.08s)]
*  and they want to keep making a lot of money. [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=2397.28s)]
*  And it is I mean, in that case, it's not a power thing. [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=2398.76s)]
*  It's a money thing. Yeah. A lot of money. [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=2401.4s)]
*  What are some of the other lobbies that are out there [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=2405.1600000000003s)]
*  that we don't even know about? [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=2406.8s)]
*  Well, the most powerful lobby is the lawyer lobby, I would say. [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=2408.6800000000003s)]
*  The teachers lobby is important or powerful. [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=2413.7200000000003s)]
*  Sometimes really to the detriment of everybody. [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=2416.96s)]
*  But the most powerful lobby is probably the lawyers. [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=2419.7200000000003s)]
*  Who would think that? Right. But they have their their. [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=2423.04s)]
*  That's why if you wanted to get rid of court cases [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=2426.04s)]
*  and cut down litigation costs, which in this country is out of control. [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=2430.04s)]
*  Losers crazy. [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=2434.88s)]
*  What you do is you go loser pays. [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=2436.04s)]
*  In other words, the loser of a lawsuit has to pay for the other side, [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=2437.56s)]
*  has to pay back all the money the other side spent. [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=2441.44s)]
*  You think that would solve it? [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=2444.24s)]
*  Yeah, we'd get rid of 75, 80 percent of of the litigation. [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=2445.7599999999998s)]
*  We are a very litigious country. [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=2450.08s)]
*  It's on everything's under it's all bureaucratic, all. [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=2452.24s)]
*  It's all dirty paperwork. It's a bunch of rigmarole. [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=2454.72s)]
*  Well, if that would happen, you'd get rid of a lot of it. [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=2457.16s)]
*  But the lawyers are opposed to it. [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=2460.3199999999997s)]
*  It will. It probably will not happen no matter what, [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=2462.2799999999997s)]
*  because obviously the lawyers want to can you do. [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=2465.8399999999997s)]
*  What would have to happen? [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=2469.2799999999997s)]
*  The Supreme Court would have to vote on something to make it happen. [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=2470.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=2472.3199999999997s)]
*  I think that maybe would have to go before the Supreme Court. [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=2473.16s)]
*  But the most powerful lobby is that lobby. [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=2476.0s)]
*  And if you wanted to get rid of litigation, if you went and, [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=2478.92s)]
*  you know, Europe has it, a lot of places have it in different countries [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=2483.28s)]
*  where loser pays. [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=2487.12s)]
*  If you sue somebody and you lose, you have to you have to pay [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=2488.92s)]
*  the costs of the other side. [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=2492.4s)]
*  Yeah, that makes sense, I think. [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=2493.96s)]
*  And what happens is people don't sue. [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=2495.04s)]
*  It's a tremendous difference. [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=2498.12s)]
*  But this country, the lawyers are very much opposed to it in this country. [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=2499.44s)]
*  It's too bad. [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=2504.16s)]
*  Yeah, man, it's just pretty heartbreaking, I feel like. [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=2505.88s)]
*  There was a rumor that you almost had R.F.K. [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=2509.44s)]
*  Jr. as a potential [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=2512.44s)]
*  vice president. No. [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=2515.7200000000003s)]
*  OK, just a rumor. [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=2518.32s)]
*  And did I like him? I've always liked him. [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=2520.4s)]
*  But I like him, too. [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=2522.6s)]
*  He's Bobby and our friends. [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=2523.6800000000003s)]
*  He's a friend of mine. I've known him for years. [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=2524.8s)]
*  He's a good man. Yeah. [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=2525.88s)]
*  He's in that pitching and stuff. [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=2527.36s)]
*  It's a two party system and he's a third party. [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=2528.6800000000003s)]
*  You know, it's a tough thing. [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=2531.08s)]
*  He can't get registered now in New York. [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=2532.04s)]
*  I see New York and the Democrats have really opposed him vehemently. [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=2534.4s)]
*  I haven't. But the Democrats have really opposed it. [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=2537.6s)]
*  So you think he should be allowed to run everywhere? [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=2541.04s)]
*  Well, the laws don't allow that. OK. [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=2543.6s)]
*  And the laws don't allow unless you have 15 or 20 percent, whatever it is, [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=2546.08s)]
*  they don't allow you to debate. [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=2549.64s)]
*  You don't have to debate. [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=2550.7999999999997s)]
*  So you can't get on the stage. You can't. [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=2552.16s)]
*  And the debates are very important. [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=2553.7599999999998s)]
*  I mean, I had a debate with Joe Biden. [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=2554.92s)]
*  Oh, yeah. And that was a very meaningful. [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=2558.4s)]
*  That was a very consequential debate, to put it mildly. [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=2560.04s)]
*  Well, yeah, they they they they took the hand out of the puppet after that. [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=2563.88s)]
*  Well, they wanted to debate. [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=2567.72s)]
*  They gave me everything that I didn't want. CNN. [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=2570.12s)]
*  And then they gave me Dana Bash and Jake Tapper. [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=2573.2799999999997s)]
*  Now, remember this, they were very straight during that debate. [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=2576.64s)]
*  I have gained a certain respect because [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=2580.3199999999997s)]
*  Jake Tapper, who I call Fake Tapper, but I don't do that. [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=2584.3199999999997s)]
*  I saw him at Whole Foods. [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=2588.56s)]
*  I don't do that so much anymore. You did. [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=2589.2s)]
*  But I thought they were very even handed. [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=2592.2799999999997s)]
*  If you want to know the truth during the debate. [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=2594.64s)]
*  I didn't feel like they like the moderate. [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=2596.6s)]
*  I didn't feel like they pushed a lot of pressure on them to be even handed. [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=2597.96s)]
*  I think it's hard to not do that. [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=2601.12s)]
*  But they were very even handed. [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=2603.44s)]
*  And it was a great debate, but a very important debate. [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=2604.88s)]
*  Well, after that, it seemed like suddenly everybody had been like, [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=2608.88s)]
*  oh, Biden's fine in America for like 18 months. [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=2612.2s)]
*  Like my dad was really old when I was born. [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=2616.52s)]
*  My dad was 70 when I was born. Right. [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=2618.16s)]
*  So I don't like seeing senior citizens get take advantage of. Right. [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=2620.2s)]
*  I felt like that happened a lot when I was a kid. [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=2623.88s)]
*  And so I think for me, it reflected on me like it made me really angry [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=2625.76s)]
*  because I was like, I know this guy's not well. [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=2630.0s)]
*  It's not fair to pretend that he's well. [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=2632.44s)]
*  It's not fair to him because he doesn't know you're pretending, you know. [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=2634.28s)]
*  And it just seemed like the cruelest thing you could do. [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=2637.6400000000003s)]
*  And then we're all kind of supposed to believe this thing that we know is not real. [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=2640.92s)]
*  Our media is just saying this is real. [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=2644.6000000000004s)]
*  And we're like we're just being gaslit as humans [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=2647.44s)]
*  about something that's like moral. [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=2651.2400000000002s)]
*  Like this is a human man. [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=2653.4s)]
*  This is somebody's grandfather. [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=2656.04s)]
*  And then they just disappear. [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=2657.44s)]
*  He just disappears. [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=2659.6800000000003s)]
*  And suddenly it's like it was a coup. [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=2660.92s)]
*  Kamala is the is the one that went in. [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=2663.28s)]
*  What do you think happened in the back rooms there? [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=2666.1600000000003s)]
*  Because that almost was overnight that happened. [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=2667.92s)]
*  I know what happened. And. [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=2669.88s)]
*  You're not supposed to do that. [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=2672.32s)]
*  It's not supposed to be probably constitutional. [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=2673.7200000000003s)]
*  She got no votes. He got 14 million votes. [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=2677.6400000000003s)]
*  All of a sudden, they're telling him to get out or they threatened him. [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=2679.76s)]
*  But who were they? [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=2682.88s)]
*  And he is an angry person. [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=2683.84s)]
*  Well, I would say Schumer, Pelosi and numerous other people. [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=2685.2400000000002s)]
*  The heads of the Democrat Party. [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=2691.8s)]
*  Yeah. And they did. [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=2693.1200000000003s)]
*  They threatened him violently, I think. [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=2695.08s)]
*  And he didn't want to get out. [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=2697.08s)]
*  Remember, he said only God will get me out, right? [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=2698.6000000000004s)]
*  Only God will get me somebody dressed up like God chased him out of there. [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=2700.6800000000003s)]
*  Yeah. And what happened is they they went to him and they said this was after the debate. [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=2703.84s)]
*  Now, if he didn't have the debate, he would still be running. [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=2709.04s)]
*  Yeah. So they set him up. [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=2712.92s)]
*  They knew they were going to pull that. [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=2715.1600000000003s)]
*  I don't know. I mean, he had his debate. [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=2716.8s)]
*  Maybe he wanted to. I heard he didn't. [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=2719.56s)]
*  I heard they offered me things that I would never accept. [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=2721.84s)]
*  And I accepted them. They said CNN, they said Jake Tapper, Dana Bash. [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=2724.56s)]
*  They said all things that I could not take. [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=2729.2400000000002s)]
*  And I accepted all of them. [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=2731.96s)]
*  And, you know, look, it was a good debate for me. [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=2734.04s)]
*  It wasn't a good debate for him. [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=2738.04s)]
*  I think it'd still be running right now. You wouldn't have her. [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=2739.36s)]
*  She was one of the most [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=2741.72s)]
*  disrespected people in the whole country. [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=2744.32s)]
*  She was she was a failed vice president. [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=2746.16s)]
*  She was the most [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=2748.88s)]
*  she was considered the worst vice president in the history of our country. [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=2751.4s)]
*  She had no chance. [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=2756.08s)]
*  You know, if you go back six weeks, they were saying how bad she was. [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=2757.48s)]
*  And they wanted to choose from 11 different people. [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=2761.16s)]
*  Do you feel I thought that's what they were going to have? [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=2763.68s)]
*  Oh, you thought that's what you would have seen more democratic. [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=2766.16s)]
*  They were they were they wanted to be politically correct. [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=2768.92s)]
*  And they chose her. [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=2773.52s)]
*  I feel like it would have seemed more. [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=2775.52s)]
*  But, dude, I got so angry when they sidetracked Bernie a few years ago. [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=2777.0s)]
*  Or that wasn't fair. [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=2780.2799999999997s)]
*  It just happened to Bernie twice. Yeah. [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=2781.64s)]
*  You think about it. Yeah. Oh, it was crazy. [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=2783.6s)]
*  Yeah. Twenty sixteen and twenty two. [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=2785.4s)]
*  He just got, you know, it just wasn't cool. [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=2786.68s)]
*  Like whatever you think. [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=2788.7999999999997s)]
*  It's just like we have to be able to believe. [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=2790.4s)]
*  Would you like Bernie? Is he are you friends with him or something? [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=2792.08s)]
*  I met him the other day. I'm like the first time. [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=2794.7599999999998s)]
*  It was the first time. Were you impressed by him? [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=2797.2s)]
*  I. Yeah. One thing he's he's still sharp, right? [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=2799.48s)]
*  Oh, yeah. He's still so he doesn't suffer from what Biden did. [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=2803.12s)]
*  No, no, no, no. Mental dullness. [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=2805.8799999999997s)]
*  Yeah. Right. I mean, mentally, it's just a violent guy. [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=2808.56s)]
*  He's you know, he's somebody put a merry-go-round in his head, I heard. [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=2813.56s)]
*  But that's, you know, but they didn't plug it in. [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=2817.04s)]
*  They didn't tell him. Yeah. [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=2819.2s)]
*  But no, one thing I like, I like the Barber. [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=2821.2799999999997s)]
*  Well, one of the things is, is the health care. [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=2823.64s)]
*  I just feel like we spend so much money in different places [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=2825.44s)]
*  and people are sick and the opioid epidemic. [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=2828.52s)]
*  I just feel like and the lower cost of drugs. [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=2831.12s)]
*  Those are things that I and did because I got insulin down and they took credit for it. [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=2834.04s)]
*  But I got it down to thirty five dollars. [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=2839.44s)]
*  And I said, I hope I win because somebody is going to take credit. [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=2842.2000000000003s)]
*  It took it takes a period of time before it kicks in statutorily. [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=2844.64s)]
*  And I got it down to thirty five dollars, which is a very low price. [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=2848.88s)]
*  And they took credit for it, which is, you know, [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=2853.04s)]
*  now I'm taking credit because I'm talking to you. [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=2855.16s)]
*  You know, if you did it, then you should be able to take credit. [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=2857.44s)]
*  I just watched her performance today. [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=2860.44s)]
*  So she went out and who Kamala. [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=2862.2799999999997s)]
*  Yeah, she lied about everything. [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=2865.08s)]
*  She said this Trump tax, that Trump tax, that Trump tax. [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=2866.72s)]
*  He's going to tax this. He's going to take all these different things. [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=2870.3599999999997s)]
*  And I'm not going to tax them. She made it up. [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=2873.08s)]
*  Did you know that four companies controlled over 80 percent [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=2876.7999999999997s)]

*  OK, is everything OK, done. [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=3106.88s)]
*  Sorry. Speaking of speaking of Kamala [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=3108.64s)]
*  and speaking of the border, we had two border patrol agents [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=3111.76s)]
*  that came on in the past two years, right, because we wanted to learn about it [[00:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=3113.96s)]
*  from people that are there on the ground. [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=3116.6000000000004s)]
*  And one of the things that we found out was a lot of times [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=3119.32s)]
*  they keep arresting the same people because the the the people [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=3121.2000000000003s)]
*  that are coming in illegally aren't being prosecuted. [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=3125.36s)]
*  That's one of the biggest problems they were saying. [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=3127.5200000000004s)]
*  What can we do differently to make things safe at the border? [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=3129.96s)]
*  It's the fact that a family can't a father can't, [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=3132.36s)]
*  you know, can't sleep at night because he doesn't know who's going through his yard [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=3136.8s)]
*  or going through it. It's just not fair. [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=3141.12s)]
*  It's not what you sign up for when you're an American. [[00:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=3142.88s)]
*  What are you going to do? [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=3145.0s)]
*  So the borders? Well, I did it. [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=3146.3599999999997s)]
*  We had the best border. Oh, the wall. [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=3148.68s)]
*  They should have kept it. I agree. [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=3150.4s)]
*  The wall built. [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=3151.56s)]
*  We had more going to come beyond long beyond what I promised. [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=3152.52s)]
*  I built hundreds of miles of wall and it worked. [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=3156.52s)]
*  Walls work, you know, walls and wheels. [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=3159.64s)]
*  I say it all the time. [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=3162.2799999999997s)]
*  Two things they never get obsolete. [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=3163.4s)]
*  Well, they also and walls. [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=3165.08s)]
*  Well, they also supplied infrastructure like people don't understand. [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=3166.3199999999997s)]
*  The wall also was a place where border patrol agents could go to get water, [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=3169.04s)]
*  to get food, to rest. It provided like a shelter out there as well. [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=3173.56s)]
*  They're in the middle of nowhere. They said it worked. [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=3177.52s)]
*  The two that I've spoken to said it. [[00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=3179.16s)]
*  And I was going to do 200 miles of wall. [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=3180.84s)]
*  We had it built and we just spent, you know, [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=3183.24s)]
*  to the specs specifications of the border patrol, we were going to put it up. [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=3185.88s)]
*  And it would take three weeks to put it up. [[00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=3191.24s)]
*  That's an additional 200 miles to fill up certain areas that, you know, [[00:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=3193.36s)]
*  when you make the wall, then all of a sudden they come in through other areas. [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=3198.44s)]
*  We had it wired and they wouldn't do it. They wouldn't put it up. [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=3202.12s)]
*  And I realize they wanted open borders. Kamala wants open borders. [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=3206.64s)]
*  She's going to have open borders. [[00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=3210.16s)]
*  We'll have 50, 60 million people because of them. [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=3211.56s)]
*  We have over 20 million people, in my opinion, right now, [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=3214.64s)]
*  they came into our country. [[00:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=3217.7999999999997s)]
*  Many come from prisons, jails, mental institutions, many terrorists. [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=3219.3199999999997s)]
*  Do you know that other countries now, their crime rate is way down [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=3225.2000000000003s)]
*  because they're sending all their criminals? [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=3228.0800000000004s)]
*  It's a party. They're sending all of their criminals to us. [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=3229.6400000000003s)]
*  And who would take this? Why is this a good thing? [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=3233.0400000000004s)]
*  It's a horrible. [[00:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=3235.6400000000003s)]
*  She should be ashamed. [[00:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=3237.48s)]
*  And, you know, she was the border czar, too. [[00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=3239.28s)]
*  He put her in charge. [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=3241.0800000000004s)]
*  She was the worst border czar in the history of the world. [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=3242.2000000000003s)]
*  She's a roller skater. That's what somebody told me the other day. [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=3245.36s)]
*  She's terrible. But what are you going to do? [[00:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=3247.88s)]
*  What's going to happen with the border when you're back? [[00:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=3249.92s)]
*  We're going to seal the border. [[00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=3251.88s)]
*  And I had it very well sealed with the with the most successful border [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=3253.2000000000003s)]
*  in the history of our country. [[00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=3257.76s)]
*  We're going to seal the border. [[00:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=3259.36s)]
*  We're going to finish up certain areas of the wall because they didn't do it. [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=3260.48s)]
*  And we're going to have an unbelievable border. [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=3264.08s)]
*  And we're going to spend a lot of time getting the criminals out. [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=3266.7200000000003s)]

*  Well, I'm going to make sure it's safe. [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=3323.24s)]
*  We had it. We had the safest border and the best border [[00:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g&t=3324.7999999999997s)]
