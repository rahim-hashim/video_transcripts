*  And just to witness all of that was pretty awesome. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=788.5s)]
*  You know, and just to be in Nashville [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=793.22s)]
*  as that team is building and putting, [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=795.9399999999999s)]
*  really just putting that anchor down, baby. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=797.8199999999999s)]
*  This was the year that they really kind of, I think, [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=799.46s)]
*  put that stamp win on the program [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=801.62s)]
*  and just a great season over there. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=804.38s)]
*  And so that was great. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=806.18s)]
*  Just to go get to do that. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=808.78s)]

*  you don't get a lot of groups like that. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=838.06s)]

*  Bitch, you're Reginald, all right? [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=1251.18s)]
*  I don't know, I'll pretend with you for 45 seconds, [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=1253.02s)]
*  but you're Reginald from social studies, sir. [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=1256.6200000000001s)]
*  And then he'd try to trim your shit up or whatever. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=1263.02s)]
*  He'd take you, they'd wash your hair. [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=1265.78s)]
*  Dude would try to fucking drown you in there. [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=1268.02s)]
*  Drown you in the sink for 50 cents, [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=1271.58s)]
*  you'd barely make it out that bitch, dude. [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=1273.38s)]
*  Just scary to be a part of some of that shit. [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=1276.9s)]
*  What were we talking about, Trevon, do you remember? [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=1279.14s)]
*  The London Christmas tree. [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=1282.58s)]
*  Oh yeah, so I can relate to not getting [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=1283.74s)]
*  what you pay for there, London, [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=1287.7s)]
*  or getting what you pay for, you know? [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=1288.98s)]
*  That's what you get, baby. [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=1293.06s)]
*  What else do we have? [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=1294.26s)]
*  Pornhub will block access for Floridians on January 1st. [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=1295.1000000000001s)]
*  And I say this, you know, I applaud this. [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=1299.66s)]
*  I have friends that work in pornography [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=1303.06s)]
*  or that do it and stuff like that, and that's fine. [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=1305.5s)]
*  This is not a judgment against any of those people [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=1307.82s)]
*  or any people that are involved in sex work. [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=1310.18s)]
*  But no one in Florida will be able to access Pornhub, [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=1315.3s)]
*  the most trafficked pornography website in the world [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=1317.7s)]
*  as of January 1st. [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=1319.78s)]
*  And honestly, I think that it's good. [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=1320.8999999999999s)]
*  You know, I think watching porno, [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=1323.82s)]
*  for me, it makes a lot of shame inside of me. [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=1332.4199999999998s)]
*  Anytime I'm busting myself out or just, you know, [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=1336.26s)]
*  anytime I'm just, you know, [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=1343.2199999999998s)]
*  just larping that fricking ranger or whatever, [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=1346.06s)]
*  or just making my body talk and do just, [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=1349.8600000000001s)]
*  you know, anytime I'm just, [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=1353.98s)]
*  anytime I'm doing pornography, [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=1356.94s)]
*  I don't feel good about myself. [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=1358.54s)]
*  That's the truth. [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=1360.46s)]
*  I don't feel good about myself. [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=1362.5s)]
*  You know, it makes me feel ashamed kind of. [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=1364.26s)]
*  It makes me feel weak. [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=1367.1s)]
*  It makes me feel ashamed of myself. [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=1368.06s)]
*  And those aren't ways that I wanna feel. [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=1371.5s)]
*  And I believe it takes away, [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=1373.98s)]
*  because I've seen this happen with so many of my friends [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=1377.3400000000001s)]
*  and myself. [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=1381.1000000000001s)]
*  I think it takes away your desire to connect [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=1382.9s)]
*  with the opposite sex, you know? [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=1387.5800000000002s)]
*  And then like you go home [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=1389.3400000000001s)]
*  and you don't have the energy for your wife. [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=1390.5s)]
*  You don't even have the attraction [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=1392.26s)]
*  because you're basically just taking the attraction [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=1393.42s)]
*  out of your body. [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=1395.94s)]
*  You know, God puts like magnets in our body [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=1398.42s)]
*  or mother nature or God, or God, mother nature, [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=1400.5800000000002s)]
*  whatever she keeps changing her name on, I have no idea. [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=1403.8600000000001s)]
*  But she's probably just hiding, you know, [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=1407.98s)]
*  trying to hide from the courts or whatever. [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=1410.5800000000002s)]
*  But she, they, and God or whatever, [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=1412.1000000000001s)]
*  they put like a magnet in your body [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=1415.38s)]
*  and that creates the attraction. [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=1419.02s)]
*  So when I'm taking all my energy [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=1421.7s)]
*  and I'm putting it just in a porno [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=1423.1000000000001s)]
*  or it's on the internet or whatever, [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=1424.6200000000001s)]
*  I'm just, I'm just giving all of my energy, [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=1425.8200000000002s)]
*  my good, beautiful human nature energy, [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=1429.42s)]
*  I'm giving it away, you know? [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=1433.7s)]
*  And then it makes me feel ashamed. [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=1437.38s)]
*  It makes me feel just, it doesn't make me feel good. [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=1439.8600000000001s)]
*  That's what I'll say. [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=1442.78s)]
*  And so I don't wanna do that. [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=1443.8600000000001s)]
*  And so I'm glad that they're starting to crack down [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=1444.98s)]
*  and not they're starting to, but we need some help. [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=1449.94s)]
*  I think that's what I think. [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=1454.1000000000001s)]
*  I think we need some help. [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=1456.3s)]
*  Yes, people should be able to watch whatever they want [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=1457.9s)]
*  or look at whatever they want. [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=1460.26s)]
*  But also I don't think we should just let things, [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=1462.14s)]
*  everything just be available. [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=1466.22s)]
*  I don't think so. [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=1468.98s)]
*  And some people might say, [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=1471.26s)]
*  well, that's like communism or something. [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=1472.58s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=1474.42s)]
*  That's like a restriction. [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=1475.26s)]
*  That's fine. [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=1476.1000000000001s)]
*  Look, I've watched enough porno to know [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=1477.66s)]
*  that you don't need it. [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=1483.66s)]
*  Now it's easy for me to say, [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=1485.46s)]
*  cause I got to see some of it, [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=1486.66s)]
*  but you know, and I'll sit around a fire [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=1487.98s)]
*  and tell you what it was like if that's what you need, [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=1490.18s)]
*  but I'm happy. [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=1491.98s)]
*  I think we need to go back to the days of drawings. [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=1493.94s)]
*  You have to sneak in, you know, [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=1496.4199999999998s)]
*  sneak into your brother's room and sneak a drawing [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=1497.46s)]
*  of some cooter out from under a fucking aquarium. [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=1499.62s)]
*  And it's a little bit wet [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=1502.26s)]
*  and it's got some fish flakes on it or whatever, [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=1503.34s)]
*  on the sketch, but that's how you get it. [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=1505.86s)]
*  You know, so I think there needs to be a little more, [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=1511.34s)]
*  more barrier to entry in the sex. [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=1513.1s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=1517.54s)]
*  And look, that's how I feel about it. [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=1518.3799999999999s)]
*  And that's okay if you feel differently, [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=1520.26s)]
*  but I've watched it have an effect on my own life. [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=1522.1799999999998s)]
*  And I'm glad it won't be as accessible, I think. [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=1524.3s)]
*  And that's okay if you feel differently. [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=1529.78s)]
*  I'm not saying what I feel is right and that's okay. [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=1533.1s)]
*  But I'm just tired of like, [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=1537.98s)]
*  I feel like it takes your masculinity, it's trying to. [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=1539.26s)]
*  And it's like these systems that use these algorithms [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=1542.46s)]
*  against us, it knows, it knows you're addicted to it. [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=1545.98s)]
*  So it's like, I'm gonna serve you that addiction right here. [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=1550.1s)]
*  And it is up to ourselves to be able to prevent ourselves [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=1552.86s)]
*  from looking at it. [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=1555.6599999999999s)]
*  I agree, but it's easier for me not to do cocaine [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=1557.2199999999998s)]
*  if somebody isn't just, if every time I open my window, [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=1561.78s)]
*  there's somebody not right there with some cocaine. [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=1566.6599999999999s)]
*  So that's all I'm saying. [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=1573.34s)]
*  This episode is sponsored by PrizePix. [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=1575.6999999999998s)]

*  Here's what I love about PrizePix. [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=1621.66s)]
*  Instead of choosing teams, you choose individual players. [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=1623.1s)]
*  That's how they do it. [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=1626.1s)]

*  including educational videos and stricter time limits [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=2157.38s)]
*  due to stricter Chinese government regulations [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=2160.3s)]
*  regarding online content for minors, [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=2162.86s)]
*  whereas the American version is considered more open [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=2164.82s)]
*  and has a wider variety of content [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=2166.86s)]

*  So I understand, like they wanna keep, [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=2176.98s)]
*  like the Chinese government probably [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=2178.54s)]
*  keeps theirs more informative, and then, [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=2180.54s)]
*  you know America, it's just, we like the fat, [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=2183.2200000000003s)]

*  I think they know now, like they should all, [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=2382.62s)]
*  they would all call it [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=2384.66s)]
*  because it feels like they just got, [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=2386.58s)]
*  they, there's no point in the hotline. [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=2388.02s)]
*  You got it, they, there's, the threat to the safety [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=2390.5s)]
*  is there. [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=2392.98s)]
*  You know, somebody had been popping off. [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=2394.82s)]
*  Somebody pulled that Draco out on somebody, [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=2396.82s)]
*  you know, because they wouldn't do to, you know, [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=2399.86s)]
*  they was wrenching somebody's mother [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=2402.38s)]
*  over to medical bills and stuff. [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=2404.94s)]
*  You knew it was gonna happen, I feel like. [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=2407.94s)]
*  And I feel like this is where we're starting to get [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=2411.22s)]
*  in society where you're gonna start to see vigilantism. [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=2413.58s)]
*  You know, some people can just say it's murder. [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=2418.1s)]
*  Some people can say it's vigilanteism. [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=2419.86s)]
*  Vigilantism. [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=2422.42s)]
*  You know, and it could be both. [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=2425.38s)]
*  That's the thing as well. [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=2426.7000000000003s)]
*  But you're just gonna see, yeah, at a certain point, [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=2430.5s)]
*  that's gonna happen. [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=2433.86s)]
*  You know, you're seeing people take things into their hands [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=2436.66s)]
*  because institutions like the government or won't do it. [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=2439.42s)]
*  That's what you're starting to see. [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=2445.86s)]
*  You're seeing it everywhere. [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=2446.82s)]
*  You know, you started to see it during COVID [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=2449.42s)]
*  when Dave Portonoy was helping out small businesses [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=2451.58s)]
*  while the government, while COVID people were, [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=2461.06s)]
*  they were shutting them down. [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=2463.02s)]
*  So you started to see private people or regular people [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=2465.22s)]
*  taking action to do things that you would think [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=2468.9s)]
*  that your government would do, right? [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=2472.34s)]
*  And I think at a certain point, [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=2475.9s)]
*  you would think that your government would keep you safe [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=2477.18s)]
*  from toxic insurance programs, and they aren't. [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=2479.74s)]
*  Medical debt is the leading cause of bankruptcy in America. [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=2488.4599999999996s)]
*  So you think about the stress and all that causes, [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=2495.2999999999997s)]
*  it's horrible, it's horrible. [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=2497.3799999999997s)]
*  But meanwhile, we have billions of dollars [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=2499.8599999999997s)]
*  to give somewhere else. [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=2501.8599999999997s)]
*  It's just fucking people are sick of things. [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=2503.4199999999996s)]
*  And then you start to see people take things [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=2505.3399999999997s)]
*  into their own hands that their government [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=2507.94s)]
*  should be doing for them. [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=2509.5s)]
*  So how do you guys feel about vigilantism or, you know, [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=2512.5s)]
*  is that a crazy thing to say? [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=2517.06s)]
*  I mean, obviously it is murder, it is a crime. [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=2518.34s)]
*  So that is no doubt. [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=2521.1s)]
*  But sometimes there are crimes that people do [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=2523.34s)]
*  because they don't, there's no choice. [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=2528.78s)]
*  You know, we give that excuse when people rob shonies [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=2533.38s)]
*  or whatever, or you rob a taco, [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=2538.6600000000003s)]
*  Vesper or whatever. [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=2544.3s)]
*  Some guy selling fucking Mexican off of the back [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=2547.2200000000003s)]
*  of a damn bird scooter or whatever, some fucking lime, [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=2549.86s)]
*  some fucking little lime monster, you know, [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=2554.86s)]
*  slinging that shit, homes, you know, slinging that shit. [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=2557.54s)]
*  But anyway, I'm fucking rambling. [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=2561.7799999999997s)]
*  I think I'm getting a little bit into the news, [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=2563.06s)]
*  but I'm just, I'm interested. [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=2564.5s)]
*  What do you guys think about vigilantism? [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=2565.62s)]
*  Do you think this is just murder? [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=2567.94s)]
*  Do you think that we're gonna see more of that [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=2570.18s)]
*  as time goes on? [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=2572.66s)]
*  Yeah, because at some point, if something bends enough, [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=2575.5s)]
*  the fuck is shit's gonna start to get weird. [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=2578.2999999999997s)]

*  I like shit, bro. [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=2589.9s)]

*  with the devil, brother. [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=2593.34s)]
*  But I love how the government thinks a hotline [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=2597.38s)]
*  is gonna help, bitch. [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=2600.9s)]
*  That's the same thing you gave to people [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=2602.58s)]
*  that were having problems with the insurance company [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=2604.94s)]
*  in the first place. [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=2607.06s)]
*  You gave them a call a hotline. [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=2608.6200000000003s)]
*  Motherfucker, his mom, your mom's, [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=2612.54s)]

*  Now she gotta call another hotline to complain about it. [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=2620.62s)]

*  I do it all morning, all night long. [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=2759.42s)]
*  Sometimes I'm getting home at three in the morning [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=2762.82s)]
*  and doing that again at seven in the morning. [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=2766.14s)]
*  So it's long days. [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=2768.2599999999998s)]
*  Yeah, brother. [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=2770.7s)]

*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=2778.7s)]
*  Romano's macaroni grill wasn't built in a day [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=2780.18s)]
*  or whatever they say, man. [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=2783.18s)]
*  I don't know what that saying is. [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=2784.7s)]
*  Onward. [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=2785.74s)]
*  And I feel like I'm giving all the joy, [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=2786.7s)]
*  but I don't have the joy being reclinished [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=2790.5s)]
*  within my temple, my body. [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=2795.02s)]

*  That's a good question. [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=2916.98s)]
*  What do you get an eight-year-old boy? [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=2917.9s)]
*  And he's just a boy, probably. [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=2920.2599999999998s)]
*  I wonder how tall he is. [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=2921.54s)]
*  How long is an eight-year-old? [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=2922.86s)]

*  How much is that? [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=2951.8199999999997s)]
*  50 feet, or sorry, 50 inches is four feet. [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=2952.66s)]
*  Okay, so we're looking at four feet tall. [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=2955.22s)]
*  Something that's four feet tall, what do you get it? [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=2957.1s)]

*  You know what, I think there was some things [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=2969.38s)]
*  my mom would get us that were fun things, [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=2971.1s)]
*  but then she would get us things that were [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=2973.86s)]
*  kind of creative, thinking things as well. [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=2975.54s)]
*  I really liked that. [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=2980.1s)]
*  We would get puzzles or different type of stuff, clay. [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=2981.18s)]
*  One year, we didn't have any money. [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=2989.02s)]
*  My mom got us a couple, she got us everybody [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=2990.3s)]
*  these two-liter sodas, these big old, [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=2993.2200000000003s)]

*  And one year, they came out with a damn three-liter soda. [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=2999.5400000000004s)]
*  Bring that bitch up. [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=3002.1000000000004s)]

*  We ride here. [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=3012.42s)]
*  You don't want it anyway. [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=3014.5s)]
*  We ride here. [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=3017.1s)]
*  We ride here. [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=3021.3s)]
*  Bro, that bitch was a gang banger. [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=3024.3s)]
*  So that, you know, that's the kind of shit [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=3028.82s)]
*  I'd get that little bastard, a three-liter soda, baby. [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=3031.18s)]
*  Shake that bitch up. [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=3034.42s)]

*  from Kohl's or maybe some Backwoods [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=3047.06s)]
*  shirts or whatever, you know, different, shit. [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=3052.38s)]

*  Full body fits. [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=3056.94s)]
*  Maybe some Backwoods fits or something. [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=3058.5s)]
*  So yeah, I think, but that an eight-year-old, [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=3061.38s)]
*  I like something though that he has to thank or something, [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=3063.42s)]
*  something you can also maybe do with him. [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=3065.98s)]
*  There's gotta be like a fun, like a good game or something [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=3068.38s)]
*  or a shovel too or a treasure map. [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=3072.46s)]
*  Get him like a something, maybe hide something for him [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=3076.78s)]
*  and get him that treasure. [[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=3081.5s)]
*  Get him a treasure, a shovel, treasure getter. [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=3085.3s)]
*  Because yeah, then you have him dig up something [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=3092.1s)]
*  and maybe it's nothing, right? [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=3094.14s)]
*  But oh well, that's life, huh? [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=3096.06s)]
*  That's life short, he better learn it now. [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=3098.46s)]
*  We're car bringing shit. [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=3101.22s)]
*  But no, I think also a big hug, [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=3105.7799999999997s)]
*  maybe take him to a nice movie. [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=3107.74s)]
*  Ooh, what about this? [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=3110.5s)]
*  What if you get him like a gift card to a movie theater [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=3112.3799999999997s)]
*  and then he gets to pick out some movies he wants to go see. [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=3115.3399999999997s)]
*  So maybe that could be something where you get to read [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=3118.4199999999996s)]
*  the movies to him and be like, well, [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=3120.2599999999998s)]
*  these are the movies they have for your age. [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=3121.66s)]
*  And then he gets to pick one and choose it. [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=3124.22s)]
*  And then it's him making a choice and feeling like [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=3126.8199999999997s)]
*  he has a choice in if you guys get to spend time together [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=3130.14s)]
*  or not. [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=3132.94s)]
*  I think that would have been something that I probably [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=3134.02s)]
*  would have enjoyed, you know, or, you know, [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=3135.74s)]
*  my mom took me to Wendy's once when we were kids [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=3138.8599999999997s)]
*  and I remember that. [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=3140.94s)]
*  And that's nice. [[00:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=3142.8199999999997s)]
*  That was something nice as well. [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=3145.66s)]

*  Thank you, brother. [[00:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=3492.34s)]
*  Thank you for checking it out. [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=3493.42s)]
*  And yeah, I feel fortunate that we get to keep doing this. [[00:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=3494.86s)]
*  My question is, I was in the military for five years [[00:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=3498.78s)]
*  and I was in Japan and I had a fiance of five years. [[00:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=3501.98s)]
*  And when I came home, I found out she cheated on me [[00:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=3506.5s)]
*  a year ago. [[00:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=3509.1400000000003s)]
*  Should I give her another chance since, I mean, [[00:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=3510.2200000000003s)]
*  I wasn't home all the time. [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=3512.26s)]
*  I'd come home once a week every year [[00:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=3513.3s)]
*  or should I just move on? [[00:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=3515.78s)]
*  Thanks, gang gang. [[00:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=3517.1400000000003s)]
*  You know, I think that's a great question. [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=3518.78s)]
*  I think you gotta look at the reality of it. [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=3520.46s)]
*  If you're home once a week for a year, that's tough. [[00:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=3522.7000000000003s)]
*  Now she broke her word. [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=3526.6200000000003s)]
*  Some people are young and at certain times, [[00:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=3528.34s)]
*  they just, their word isn't really as strong [[00:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=3530.5s)]
*  because they are still putting their word together. [[00:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=3533.46s)]
*  And I'm not justifying everybody's behavior, [[00:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=3536.46s)]
*  everybody's behavior. [[00:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=3539.86s)]
*  I'm not justifying my own behavior even. [[00:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=3540.78s)]
*  But there's definitely a different, you know, [[00:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=3544.54s)]
*  you know, you're still, you're learning some things. [[00:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=3549.2200000000003s)]
*  And people say, you're learning in your 20s? [[00:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=3551.1400000000003s)]
*  Yeah, you are. [[00:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=3552.94s)]
*  Yeah, you're learning how to be in a long, [[00:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=3554.6000000000004s)]
*  all that stuff. [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=3556.2999999999997s)]
*  You're figuring it out. [[00:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=3557.14s)]
*  Sometimes you're afraid to hurt somebody's feelings [[00:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=3558.54s)]
*  and that's why you don't tell them, [[00:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=3560.34s)]
*  even though that's selfish [[00:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=3561.2599999999998s)]
*  because it has hurt them in the longer way. [[00:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=3562.86s)]
*  But you don't know that. [[00:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=3564.2999999999997s)]
*  You're figuring it out sometimes. [[00:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=3565.14s)]
*  So I think it's possible. [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=3570.06s)]
*  I've had friends that have forgiven the loved one [[00:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=3573.5s)]
*  or significant other for sexual indiscrepancies [[00:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=3577.14s)]
*  and then they packaged it up. [[00:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=3581.2999999999997s)]
*  And now you can hear them, you know, you'll invite them. [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=3583.46s)]
*  I won't even invite them over [[00:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=3586.7400000000002s)]
*  because they'll be in there thumping, brother. [[00:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=3587.58s)]
*  They'll be in there just slurping. [[00:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=3589.38s)]
*  So I think that's part of it. [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=3592.78s)]
*  But yeah, I think, and look, you can always try it [[00:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=3595.38s)]
*  and see how it goes. [[00:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=3598.14s)]
*  But the weird thing, and I've done this, [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=3600.7000000000003s)]
*  where you forgive somebody, [[01:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=3602.5s)]
*  but then you keep bringing that shit up. [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=3603.62s)]
*  That isn't good. [[01:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=3606.26s)]
*  It feels good, but it's not cool. [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=3607.9s)]
*  So that's the thing you can't do. [[01:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=3611.1s)]
*  If you forgive, you have to forgive, man. [[01:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=3612.42s)]
*  You have to forgive because otherwise [[01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=3615.18s)]
*  you're just letting somebody hold, [[01:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=3617.18s)]
*  you're basically holding a card. [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=3618.5s)]
*  You're saying, I'm gonna hold this card [[01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=3620.5s)]
*  that I can use whenever I want. [[01:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=3621.9s)]
*  And that's worse than choosing to forgive or not to forgive. [[01:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=3624.2599999999998s)]
*  You know, that's you then saying, I want this power. [[01:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=3629.2599999999998s)]
*  I want this power to control [[01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=3632.06s)]
*  how the situation goes constantly. [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=3634.5s)]
*  And I'll notice that in my own life over certain times. [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=3639.22s)]
*  I wanna keep a level of communication. [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=3642.2599999999998s)]
*  I wanna keep enough distance where I can kind of, [[01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=3646.14s)]
*  like if I think somebody might be like having an issue [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=3653.8999999999996s)]
*  or might be upset about it, [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=3656.74s)]
*  instead of bringing it up and talking and getting it out, [[01:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=3657.7s)]
*  I'd rather almost sometimes, [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=3660.06s)]
*  this is not the best part of me that wants to do this, [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=3662.3399999999997s)]
*  but there's a part of me sometimes that would, [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=3664.74s)]
*  it'd almost rather let them be unsure. [[01:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=3667.18s)]
*  Let them be unsure if our relationship is okay, [[01:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=3672.58s)]
*  because it gives me some sort of power. [[01:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=3675.74s)]
*  It gives me some sort of perceived control in my own head. [[01:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=3679.66s)]
*  And that's a sick part of me that operates that way. [[01:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=3685.62s)]
*  And it's not always or anything, [[01:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=3687.9399999999996s)]
*  and it's definitely been more in the past, [[01:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=3689.3799999999997s)]
*  but I have noticed that behavior in myself at times [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=3690.7s)]
*  if I'm not doing well or not taking care of myself. [[01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=3692.8999999999996s)]
*  I'd rather keep things on thin ice because [[01:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=3697.7s)]
*  I'm used to, that's why I do well. [[01:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=3701.8999999999996s)]
*  I'm okay on thin ice. [[01:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=3704.5s)]
*  How you gonna be out here? [[01:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=3706.3399999999997s)]
*  It's that kind of shit. [[01:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=3708.74s)]
*  But holding the grudge, or yeah, holding the grudge [[01:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=3712.2999999999997s)]
*  type shit. [[01:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=3714.98s)]
*  But yeah, man, I wish you the best luck. [[01:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=3716.02s)]
*  I think it's nice of you to call and ask about it, man. [[01:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=3717.14s)]
*  And also we all figure things out as we go. [[01:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=3720.1s)]
*  So don't be too hard on yourself either. [[01:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=3723.02s)]
*  You know. [[01:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=3726.38s)]
*  Let me hear one right here. [[01:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=3730.9s)]
*  Oh, there's a bug on this wrapping paper. [[01:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=3733.7s)]
*  It's okay. [[01:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=3735.82s)]
*  Does blue chew work? [[01:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=3737.98s)]

*  Does blue chew work, baby? [[01:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=3741.58s)]
*  Does it give you that randall? [[01:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=3743.58s)]

*  I can't, you know. [[01:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=4254.94s)]
*  And once when that hit me, I was like, oh shit, man. [[01:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=4258.0599999999995s)]
*  I'm washing myself in bath water. [[01:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=4260.9s)]
*  I'm doing the things I'm supposed to do [[01:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=4263.94s)]
*  to take care of myself. [[01:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=4265.379999999999s)]
*  I'm getting this stuff off of me and out of my system. [[01:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=4266.74s)]
*  But then I got a straw in my own bath water. [[01:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=4269.099999999999s)]
*  And I was sitting there just slurping [[01:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=4272.98s)]
*  on my own sadness all the time. [[01:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=4275.74s)]
*  Now I'm not saying that's what you're doing, [[01:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=4278.0599999999995s)]
*  but I noticed for myself that self-pity [[01:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=4279.139999999999s)]
*  became a drug for me. [[01:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=4281.5s)]
*  What else, man? [[01:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=4285.9s)]
*  Let me think of something else. [[01:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=4286.74s)]
*  You know, that's a lot, man. [[01:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=4291.9s)]
*  Because a lot of what you're saying has real [[01:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=4293.74s)]
*  emotional attachment to it. [[01:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=4296.259999999999s)]
*  You're trying to get your kids out of your house. [[01:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=4298.42s)]
*  That's a lot of upheaval. [[01:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=4301.86s)]
*  And I think some of that probably just takes time. [[01:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=4304.98s)]
*  But yeah, I'm sorry, man. [[01:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=4310.7s)]
*  That's also a lot. [[01:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=4311.54s)]
*  That's a lot. [[01:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=4312.74s)]
*  I think just give yourself some grace to be, [[01:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=4313.58s)]
*  you know, to not also put the pressure on yourself [[01:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=4316.42s)]
*  to feel great. [[01:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=4319.58s)]
*  You know, it's a lot of tough stuff going on. [[01:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=4321.7s)]
*  You know, the other day I was upset about something. [[01:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=4325.66s)]
*  I wanted to call and just fucking rearrange [[01:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=4328.58s)]
*  the tits on somebody. [[01:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=4331.0199999999995s)]
*  I wanted to switch them bitches, [[01:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=4333.0199999999995s)]
*  put the FM one on the AM dial and vice versa. [[01:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=4334.7s)]
*  I was just pissed at this lady. [[01:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=4337.94s)]
*  But instead I just sat in my car for a little bit. [[01:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=4341.14s)]
*  I breathed. [[01:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=4345.900000000001s)]
*  That's why God gave me this big note. [[01:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=4347.740000000001s)]
*  And he's like, breathe motherfucker, what are you doing? [[01:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=4349.58s)]
*  You out here just fucking just taking chances, bitch. [[01:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=4352.34s)]
*  I'm showing you. [[01:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=4354.820000000001s)]
*  You know, do eight ball of air, buddy. [[01:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=4357.22s)]
*  We need, you know, G up. [[01:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=4359.02s)]
*  And I had me a couple Charleston shoes there. [[01:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=4364.02s)]
*  I found them in my car door and I ate them bitches. [[01:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=4365.700000000001s)]
*  Oh, and then I just went to a meeting. [[01:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=4367.74s)]
*  And after that, after that I even called my brother. [[01:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=4370.34s)]
*  I said, hey man, I can't, I'm about to lose. [[01:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=4373.38s)]
*  You know, if I call this person right now, [[01:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=4376.099999999999s)]
*  I'm gonna lose my mind. [[01:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=4376.94s)]
*  He said, well, wait till later. [[01:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=4377.78s)]
*  Because I was attaching all this other shit to my day. [[01:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=4381.34s)]
*  I was attaching all this old, [[01:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=4386.139999999999s)]
*  these feelings and stuff to my day. [[01:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=4387.9s)]
*  And I was like, I'm gonna lose my mind. [[01:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=4389.78s)]
*  I'm gonna lose my mind. [[01:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=4391.7s)]
*  I'm gonna lose my mind. [[01:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=4392.54s)]
*  I'm gonna lose my mind. [[01:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=4393.38s)]
*  I'm gonna lose my mind. [[01:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=4394.219999999999s)]
*  I'm gonna lose my mind. [[01:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=4395.0599999999995s)]
*  These feelings and stuff to my day. [[01:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=4396.139999999999s)]
*  And to that next thing, [[01:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=4400.259999999999s)]
*  I was bringing a whole trailer full of bullshit [[01:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=4401.179999999999s)]
*  and I was gonna hitch it to this one moment [[01:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=4404.099999999999s)]
*  about the way things had gone down with this woman. [[01:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=4407.0199999999995s)]
*  It wasn't like a dating, it was a work thing. [[01:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=4412.219999999999s)]
*  But it was all me, it was all my shit, you know? [[01:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=4416.179999999999s)]
*  That I was bringing extra to what would have just, [[01:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=4420.62s)]
*  and then when I finally was chill, [[01:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=4422.9s)]
*  later on it was a normal conversation [[01:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=4425.1s)]
*  and it was actually positive. [[01:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=4427.38s)]
*  So it could be positive. [[01:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=4429.58s)]
*  I don't know what I'm telling you, man. [[01:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=4430.54s)]
*  I'm just telling you, I'm just, [[01:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=4431.780000000001s)]
*  yeah, man, I'm sorry that you're dealing with that [[01:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=4433.14s)]
*  and it's a tough time of year and it's the holidays. [[01:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=4434.900000000001s)]
*  But you're not alone, man. [[01:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=4438.5s)]
*  We're only alone when we find ourselves alone. [[01:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=4440.900000000001s)]
*  We gotta remember to get out there too. [[01:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=4442.740000000001s)]
*  Nobody's gonna come and just help us be on alone. [[01:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=4445.38s)]
*  We have to do it. [[01:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=4448.06s)]
*  And they say that old saying, [[01:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=4452.5s)]
*  nothing changes if nothing changes, you know? [[01:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=4454.06s)]
*  So if I want something to be different, [[01:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=4457.34s)]
*  I have to do something different. [[01:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=4458.54s)]
*  And I'm not preaching at you, I'm listening. [[01:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=4463.740000000001s)]
*  I'm basically just talking to myself right now. [[01:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=4465.700000000001s)]
*  But yeah, man, I love you and keep your head up [[01:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=4469.580000000001s)]
*  and next year will be a different year. [[01:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=4473.22s)]
*  You know, next year will be a different year. [[01:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=4476.660000000001s)]
*  And don't leave before the miracle happens. [[01:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=4480.02s)]
*  You know that saying, that's what they say. [[01:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=4482.1s)]
*  But Merry Christmas, thank you for being [[01:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=4484.9400000000005s)]
*  a supporter of this podcast. [[01:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=4486.46s)]
*  Thank you for letting me be a part of your life. [[01:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=4488.22s)]
*  I'm gonna make some New Year's resolutions, [[01:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=4493.02s)]
*  something, nothing too heavy, just some things, [[01:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=4494.660000000001s)]
*  like some goals for the new year. [[01:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=4496.42s)]
*  You know, we wanna do more ways to give back [[01:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=4498.780000000001s)]
*  and I'm excited about that. [[01:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=4500.860000000001s)]
*  We're finally putting a foundation together, [[01:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=4501.900000000001s)]
*  so that's really exciting. [[01:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=4503.620000000001s)]
*  And so we're gonna be able to find ways to do that. [[01:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=4507.06s)]
*  And what else? [[01:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=4509.9800000000005s)]
*  I think to just learn more from people [[01:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=4513.54s)]
*  that can help us learn. [[01:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=4516.34s)]
*  You know, I wanna learn more and get more information. [[01:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=4517.98s)]
*  And learn more about myself too. [[01:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=4522.78s)]
*  You know, and try not to do everything by myself. [[01:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=4525.98s)]
*  You know, that's one of my things I struggle with sometimes, [[01:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=4532.4s)]
*  I just wanna do it all alone. [[01:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=4534.18s)]
*  But the saddest thing I realized [[01:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=4536.7s)]
*  when you do everything alone, [[01:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=4538.06s)]
*  after it's done, there's nobody to talk to about it. [[01:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=4540.46s)]
*  There's nobody to share what there's not, you know. [[01:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=4544.66s)]
*  But anyway, not trying to end on a dour note. [[01:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=4548.22s)]
*  Oh yeah, we went out Christmas caroling the other day, [[01:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=4552.5s)]
*  you know, I'd been wanting to get out and do it. [[01:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=4554.9s)]
*  And it was just some guys from the gym, [[01:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=4558.62s)]
*  we put a little squad together and went out there [[01:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=4561.26s)]
*  and hit the streets and we had a couple bangers, [[01:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=4563.66s)]
*  we had a couple bangers, a couple songs we had to give up [[01:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=4567.54s)]
*  just in the middle of it. [[01:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=4570.46s)]
*  There was one church group that was having a dinner, [[01:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=4573.42s)]
*  they invited us in for some cookies [[01:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=4575.18s)]
*  and select meats and stuff. [[01:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=4576.9400000000005s)]
*  And it was good, man, we did a good job. [[01:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=4581.42s)]
*  We did a good job out there, [[01:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=4586.42s)]
*  we just put some songs together and just walked the streets [[01:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=4587.46s)]
*  and just went up to people's doors and knocked. [[01:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=4590.3s)]
*  And yeah, people were happy, [[01:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=4593.14s)]
*  somebody had a dog that saw us as well [[01:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=4595.34s)]
*  and so people and animals were really enjoying it. [[01:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=4597.66s)]
*  And one went Alzheimer's saw us and then, [[01:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=4599.900000000001s)]
*  I don't know if she saw us or not, fuck it, we was there. [[01:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=4604.02s)]
*  But we enjoyed it, man. [[01:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=4606.5s)]
*  Anyway, I just wanna wish everybody a Merry Christmas. [[01:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX4MwGk2p4&t=4610.9800000000005s)]
