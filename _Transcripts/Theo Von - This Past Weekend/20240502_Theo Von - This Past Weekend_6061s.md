**Theo Von - This Past Weekend:** [May 02, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY)
*  Today's episode was filmed when I was down in the Australia and she's probably one of [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=0.0s)]
*  the biggest comedians in Australia. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=5.88s)]
*  She's well known for her viral clips online. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=10.4s)]
*  She's hilarious. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=14.96s)]
*  Her Netflix show Well Mania and she's currently touring the US right now. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=15.96s)]
*  Today's guest is Celeste Barber. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=20.76s)]
*  S aweful. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=23.84s)]
*  11 minutes ago, my Australia, New Zealand tour went on sale. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=52.16s)]
*  No way. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=57.64s)]
*  So I'm just being a little bit obnoxious for 30 seconds. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=58.64s)]
*  You want to check the stats? [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=61.8s)]
*  To make sure, note that it has uploaded because Instagram has become really needy. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=62.8s)]
*  I don't know if you've noticed. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=66.8s)]
*  When you post, you've got to keep the app open for it to upload. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=68.92s)]
*  You can't just post and then walk away, Renee. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=73.36s)]
*  And it does its thing. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=76.0s)]
*  It's like, it's needy. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=77.24s)]
*  So let's make sure that it's up. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=78.24s)]
*  I'm just going to sit there with a video of myself playing while I sit with you and talk [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=80.08s)]
*  about myself. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=83.88000000000001s)]
*  It's kind of the world we're in. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=84.88000000000001s)]
*  It's like you will see somebody editing a photo of themselves and writing in their diary [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=87.8s)]
*  at the same time, you know? [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=92.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=94.64s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=95.64s)]
*  It's really bizarre. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=96.64s)]
*  I always say that to people when they're about like press and stuff. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=97.64s)]
*  They're like, oh, you know, the press are running shit on me. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=101.28s)]
*  They're running shit on me. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=103.80000000000001s)]
*  And I'm like, I haven't, I haven't seen it. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=104.80000000000001s)]
*  You're in a fucking vortex of yourself. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=106.24000000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=107.76s)]
*  And I'm like, oh no, it's everywhere. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=108.80000000000001s)]
*  And I'm like, turn Google alerts off on yourself. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=109.80000000000001s)]
*  Turn them off. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=113.72s)]
*  You don't need to get Google alerts about yourself every fucking 10 minutes. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=114.72s)]
*  You pull this in? [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=117.72s)]
*  Do you care if we start or no? [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=118.72s)]
*  No, I don't care. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=119.72s)]
*  Sorry. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=120.72s)]
*  I'm being rude. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=121.72s)]
*  I also have been in a hotel for four nights, which buckles my voice. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=122.72s)]
*  So I sound like a creepy person teenager. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=126.08000000000001s)]
*  Why do you think the air in there is bad or something? [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=128.96s)]
*  The rooms are so expensive. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=131.48000000000002s)]
*  Maybe they put cheap air in the room. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=132.8s)]
*  Well, yeah. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=134.36s)]
*  And just I need natural air. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=135.36s)]
*  When hotels are fancy, they don't. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=136.76s)]
*  Well, some of them are so expensive, dude. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=140.2s)]
*  I've been in ones where it's like, it's so you're like, I'm not even going to sleep. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=142.04s)]
*  If I even blink my eyes, it's going to cost me 30 bucks. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=147.2s)]
*  Oh, absolutely. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=150.6s)]
*  I stayed. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=151.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=152.6s)]
*  I remember the first time I stayed in like a really fancy place. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=153.6s)]
*  I stayed up all night. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=154.95999999999998s)]
*  I was like, oh, I'm not going to waste the money. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=155.95999999999998s)]
*  You're going to get paid to sleep. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=158.32s)]
*  They're going to charge you to go to sleep. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=160.44s)]
*  I'm not. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=161.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=162.68s)]
*  I came here to fucking use this place. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=163.68s)]
*  You know? [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=164.68s)]
*  I think I read one of the books or something. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=165.88s)]
*  In the hotel. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=170.56s)]
*  I started reading like a couple of checks just to get your money. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=171.56s)]
*  You know, it's like your money's worth. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=173.20000000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=175.08s)]
*  You want to get your money's worth. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=176.08s)]
*  I left the water going for a couple of hours. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=177.08s)]
*  I remember. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=178.56s)]
*  Do you travel with anything specifically? [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=179.56s)]
*  No, just usually a little bit of hairspray, I guess. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=182.08s)]
*  But yeah, just a bit. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=184.8s)]
*  What else do I like to have in my room? [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=186.60000000000002s)]
*  Water. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=189.56s)]
*  Oh, powerade or Gatorade. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=190.56s)]
*  Or butterscotch. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=194.92s)]
*  What else do you like? [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=196.28s)]
*  Well, when I travel, like in a hotel, I have to take my pillow. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=197.28s)]
*  I've got to take my pillow with me. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=200.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=202.11999999999998s)]
*  I've become that girl. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=203.11999999999998s)]
*  But even with water now, I love it. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=204.11999999999998s)]
*  In the hotel I was just in, had some couple of bottles of water and it said, complimentary. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=206.67999999999998s)]
*  It's like, yeah, no shit. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=210.67999999999998s)]
*  It's fucking water. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=212.83999999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=213.83999999999997s)]
*  But they're like just pointing out this bit. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=214.83999999999997s)]
*  Complimentary. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=217.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=218.56s)]
*  $5,000 a fucking night to stay here. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=219.56s)]
*  The least you can do. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=222.2s)]
*  Give me some complimentary water. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=223.2s)]
*  Yeah, it's so true. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=225.2s)]
*  And sometimes it'll say like $13 water. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=227.8s)]
*  They'll have like the complimentary ones, like the little ones. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=230.2s)]
*  Like a thimble of fucking water. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=234.2s)]
*  And the little ones sometimes are even like warmer somehow. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=236.04s)]
*  It's like they want it to seem like maybe it's been already used once or something. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=239.48000000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=244.12s)]
*  You're not that special. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=245.12s)]
*  Someone else has run this around their mouth, spat it back in. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=246.12s)]
*  A fancy person. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=249.08s)]
*  And now you can have it for free. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=250.08s)]
*  Some lord has been using this. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=251.68s)]
*  Seinfeld walked past this door. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=254.28s)]
*  Now you get to have free water. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=256.52000000000004s)]
*  And then they'll have the larger cool bottle next to it. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=259.44s)]
*  It'll say like still water or deceased water. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=263.0s)]
*  Deceased water. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=266.12s)]
*  And it's always in a sexy bottle. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=267.12s)]
*  It's like, well, I don't want that shitty water. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=268.12s)]
*  I want the sexy water. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=269.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=271.2s)]
*  And you have to remortgage your house to fucking pay for it. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=272.2s)]
*  Is this free water? [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=276.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=277.92s)]
*  That's free. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=279.76s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=280.76s)]
*  That's free. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=281.76s)]
*  We'll come in with a nicer one on a tray in a little bit. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=282.76s)]
*  How much would that cost me? [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=283.76s)]
*  Dude, you know what's interesting about Celeste Barber? [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=284.76s)]
*  Sure. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=289.08000000000004s)]
*  Nice to see you. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=290.08000000000004s)]
*  Wow. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=292.28000000000003s)]

*  But even restroom is... [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=379.92s)]
*  It's like if you walked in there and somebody was sleeping, just Goldilocking in there under [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=381.64s)]
*  the sinks or whatever, you would be so lost. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=387.24s)]

*  I kind of... [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=840.4s)]
*  It was really important to me that I bridged that gap because the internet is free. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=841.4s)]
*  Right? [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=846.4s)]
*  So, you know, you've got millions of followers, but it doesn't fucking cost them anything. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=847.4s)]
*  So how many followers do you, you know, how loyal are people? [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=851.4s)]
*  That's a great point, huh? [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=854.4s)]
*  People are like, I love you, I love you because you're free, bitch, and you're in my hand. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=855.4s)]
*  When I'm on the toilet, I'm good. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=858.4s)]
*  But then I wanted to see how that translated and it translated very well, you know, sold [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=860.4s)]
*  out shows. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=865.4s)]
*  But I really wanted to prove my stripes because I trained as an actor. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=866.4s)]
*  That was always my thing. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=870.4s)]
*  But I started the Instagram stuff because I couldn't get a fucking job. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=871.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=874.4s)]
*  So I did that and then, you know, it blew up and I didn't want to just, yeah, like you [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=875.4s)]
*  say, just kind of be on stage and people be like, oh, you're better here. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=880.4s)]
*  So I wanted to make sure that it translates well. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=884.4s)]
*  It's so funny to say that there's something scary in a way, I thought about this, about [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=887.4s)]
*  people coming to see you live because you're like, if they already like me, then all I'm [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=893.4s)]
*  doing is risking them not liking me. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=900.4s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=903.4s)]
*  There's fucking there's something that's kind of like harrowing about it. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=904.4s)]
*  Like there's there's times where I'm like, gosh, I just. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=907.4s)]
*  If they already like me, I'm maybe we're good. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=911.4s)]
*  Yeah. Like, what the fuck am I doing? [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=915.4s)]
*  Why am I? Yeah. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=916.4s)]
*  It's like, well, they like me and now I'm going to do a tour to see if they really like [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=917.4s)]
*  me. So that's fucking masochistic. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=922.4s)]
*  Like, what is that? [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=924.4s)]
*  It's like, prove it. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=925.4s)]
*  Prove it that you like me. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=926.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=928.4s)]
*  You know, because the parodies and stuff I do on Instagram at first, people like, are [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=929.4s)]
*  you just going to kind of come on stage and then just like change into different costumes? [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=932.4s)]
*  So I thought, you know, it's that tricky thing of going, well, do I give an already [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=936.4s)]
*  excellent, strong audience more of what I've already given them and what it seems like [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=942.4s)]
*  they want? Or do I give them what I think would be a better show? [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=948.4s)]
*  So, you know, yeah, like, what the fuck do you do there? [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=951.4s)]
*  I know it's scary. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=955.4s)]
*  Yeah. And then just keep fucking going out and doing it. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=956.4s)]
*  And again, you know, you sell a show, you sell a tour, it goes really well. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=960.4s)]
*  And you're like, oh, cool. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=963.4s)]
*  They do like me, but it's not enough. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=965.4s)]
*  So now I'm doing another fucking tour and now I'm panicking about that. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=968.4s)]
*  Like, what is that that we do? [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=971.4s)]
*  It's so masochistic. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=972.4s)]
*  Just stop. Just start selling water. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=974.4s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=977.4s)]
*  Make money that way. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=979.4s)]
*  Stop making things hard for yourself, Celeste. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=980.4s)]
*  Yeah. Stop making things hard for yourself. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=982.4s)]
*  Yeah. I wonder. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=985.4s)]
*  There's definitely I have this thing like I want to make sure that I get to see [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=986.4s)]
*  every like I'll go to all the more like I'll try and go perform at all the markets. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=990.4s)]
*  Like some people will go to the big city. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=995.4s)]
*  I'll go to like as like I mean, I can't you can't go to like towns really. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=997.4s)]
*  But there's like fantasy in my head where I'm just on a bus like and we just set up a tent [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=1002.4s)]
*  and we do the show in a town just like I just want to get every I want to. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=1007.4s)]
*  Yeah. I want to interact with everybody. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=1012.4s)]
*  You want to reach everybody. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=1014.4s)]
*  But the weird thing is we do on our phones. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=1015.4s)]
*  I know. I guess it's so ridiculous. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=1018.4s)]
*  But I think I have this romantic version, this old school version, you know. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=1020.4s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=1024.4s)]
*  That I romanticize sometimes. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=1025.4s)]
*  Have you done a tour bus? Do you do tour buses? [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=1027.4s)]
*  Yeah, I've done a tour bus. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=1029.4s)]
*  We've tried everything. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=1030.4s)]
*  We tried the motorcycle with the little thing on the side of it. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=1031.4s)]
*  Oh, fucking hell. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=1035.4s)]
*  Oh, we tried that. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=1036.4s)]
*  And I was like sitting there just holding a box of like T-shirts for merch. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=1037.4s)]
*  Yeah, some caps. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=1040.4s)]
*  Some caps. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=1041.4s)]
*  We tried the camper van like a family camper, you know, that you rent. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=1042.4s)]
*  It's like $19 a day. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=1046.4s)]
*  And it's basically just like a cage. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=1048.4s)]
*  Oh yeah, and they don't go up hills. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=1050.4s)]
*  Yeah, you got to jump out and kind of fucking push it up. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=1051.4s)]
*  I know those. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=1053.4s)]
*  There's nothing in there. It's like an anytime fitness basically. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=1054.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=1056.4s)]
*  It's like an anytime fitness on wheels. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=1057.4s)]
*  There's like two kettlebells in there and then there's just some like fucking. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=1059.4s)]
*  And Chevy Chase just sitting in the front. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=1062.4s)]
*  And some dangerous man complaining that the water fountain's broken. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=1065.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=1069.4s)]
*  How many people do you tour around with? [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=1070.4s)]
*  My tour manager, Tim, and then two comedians usually. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=1072.4s)]
*  Yeah, I keep it. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=1077.4s)]
*  So it's a pretty small group. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=1078.4s)]
*  But then if you get a production, like if you start to go into places where you have to bring production and then you have to bring like. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=1079.4s)]
*  Then there's other people that come, but they are more of like the production side maybe. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=1084.4s)]
*  But it's pretty interesting. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=1089.4s)]
*  It's pretty interesting just to see it and learn. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=1091.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=1094.4s)]
*  It's kind of scary though, some of the responsibility. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=1095.4s)]
*  I think just with touring, it's like once you're like, OK, I'm really going to go do this. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=1098.4s)]
*  Yeah, I'm this guy now. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=1103.4s)]

*  We did a tour bus 2018, massive fucking tour bus. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=1108.4s)]
*  It had 12 bunks in it. [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=1111.4s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=1113.4s)]

*  And it was like a Janet Jackson backup dancer fucking bus. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=1119.4s)]
*  And we just ran amok on it. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=1122.4s)]

*  No, all around America. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=1128.4s)]
*  No, we don't do tour buses here because it's too big. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=1129.4s)]

*  navigating how fucking doors work? Because you're in a different place every time. So [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=1181.16s)]
*  some doors are pushed, some doors are running, like it's so, so discomfited. [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=1184.68s)]
*  Well you think the government, right? [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=1188.88s)]
*  Would get their shit together. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=1190.5600000000002s)]
*  And I don't want to say anything NATO or whoever the group, you know, NAACP, I don't know who [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=1191.5600000000002s)]

*  Right? How fucking hard is it? [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=1201.88s)]
*  I don't know, some of those, like, some of those hinges are kind of, I don't want to [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=1205.0s)]
*  say, I don't know what they are. They're just, they're bisexual, I think. [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=1209.76s)]
*  Okay, I was going to say they're shit. [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=1214.96s)]
*  I just mean, some of them are willing to do anything. [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=1216.76s)]
*  Right. [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=1220.28s)]
*  Yeah, and they're also super shit. I know we need, on International Women's Day, let's [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=1221.28s)]
*  get some fucking women making doors, I reckon, and they'll swing when we need them to swing. [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=1224.92s)]
*  Yeah, I like that. Yeah, we need some fucking women's doors, huh? [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=1228.84s)]
*  We need doors for women only. [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=1234.04s)]
*  Women's fucking doors. It's about time. [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=1238.48s)]
*  In America, there's a lot of women that will say that there's like a male glass ceiling [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=1240.76s)]
*  on comedy and stuff. Do you hear that here or no? Do you feel like it's just? [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=1245.6s)]
*  Oh, a glass ceiling, yeah, absolutely. Not a male, oh, what the men have put it. [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=1248.76s)]
*  But nobody says that the glass ceiling is made out of men, you know what I'm saying? [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=1253.56s)]
*  No, we know that though. We know that, you know, because it's, yeah, it's been made by [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=1256.6399999999999s)]
*  men. Good luck. Well done with that though. [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=1260.1599999999999s)]
*  All those glass ceilings are made by the same person. They should get into the fucking [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=1262.84s)]
*  doors. Does it feel like that in the like in the Australia comedy scene, I guess, because [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=1266.48s)]
*  I don't know the scene that much. I have some friends here who are comedians, but knowing [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=1270.4399999999998s)]
*  the scene is totally different, you know? Yeah, look, I started as an actor. I've always [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=1275.32s)]
*  been funny, but I'm not like a comedian that's been gigging for 25 years, you know what I [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=1281.3999999999999s)]
*  mean? Doing the 3am slot and all that sort of stuff. So I kind of came up performing, [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=1286.36s)]
*  so it's kind of a different avenue. And Australia's really different to the States. Like we don't [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=1291.3600000000001s)]
*  have comedy clubs on every corner. We have a handful of clubs. We have like open mic [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=1295.6000000000001s)]
*  nights at pubs or bars, but it's not, it's nowhere near as big as it is in the States. [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=1301.24s)]
*  I did notice that when I got to America, I went into a comedy club there and I walked [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=1307.96s)]
*  into the dressing room a few years ago and I was like, do you reckon we could take that [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=1314.3600000000001s)]
*  massive life-size photo of Bill Cosby down? Is that cool? And they were like, yeah, we can't. [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=1319.04s)]
*  It's kind of like drilled in and I fucking ripped it off the wall and shoved it behind the toilet. [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=1324.56s)]
*  It's like, yeah. Haven't been asked back there. That's fine. Some of them, they don't want you to see. [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=1329.76s)]
*  Some of them, they're just, they're lost, I'll say. Yeah. They're obviously into a different type of [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=1335.3600000000001s)]
*  entertainer. And I play theaters now, so it's fine. And he's obviously a hypnotist. Yeah, [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=1341.04s)]
*  misunderstood, I think they say. What if he just said, what if that had been his, [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=1346.4s)]
*  what if that had been his defense in court? I'm just a really bad hypnotist. [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=1351.68s)]
*  Fucking hell. So crazy. Has he died? [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=1357.2s)]
*  I don't think he just went back out on tour. No, he didn't. I think Nick Swartson's touring with him. [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=1360.96s)]
*  On International Women's Day, he's just jumped back out on tour. So what's just happened? [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=1365.52s)]
*  Are you telling me that his fucking tour went on sale the same day mine did? [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=1369.84s)]
*  Fuck you, Cosme. So people can go see you. So all your, just your Australia, New Zealand tour went on. [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=1376.08s)]
*  But America's on sale. So I'm in America, May, June. [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=1382.0s)]
*  And you start with the Netflix festival. Netflix festival and then Phoenix and over to Washington [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=1386.16s)]
*  and then fuck around for a bit. It's tricky because I'm based here. I've got a family here. [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=1391.52s)]
*  I've got a life here. So yeah, it's hard. I'm trying, this will be the fourth time I've done [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=1396.8799999999999s)]
*  a world tour and I'm still trying to figure out the best way to do it. I don't know. [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=1402.8s)]
*  Like the last one I did, I was saying, you know, I did a heap of shows because I was like, [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=1408.1599999999999s)]
*  just cram the fuckers in so I can just go get it all done and then get home. But that was too, [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=1412.1599999999999s)]
*  it's like still six or so weeks without seeing my kids. And I just finished filming a show [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=1418.08s)]
*  down here. I don't live in Sydney. I live North. So I was away from them. They had three days to [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=1424.3999999999999s)]
*  build the show and then take it on. So that was all bananas. So this time I'm trying to do [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=1428.8s)]
*  like a couple of weeks and then we're going to have a week off. So the family will come over. [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=1434.3999999999999s)]
*  We'll hang out in Mexico and then I'll go back out for like three weeks. But it's just, [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=1438.32s)]
*  it's hard to kind of navigate that. It's hard being like a mom and all that. But living on the [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=1443.68s)]
*  other side of the world is really, it's hard because most of my audience is in America. [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=1448.8s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, my only child is my own depression usually. And I've just, that's, [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=1454.1599999999999s)]
*  I've got her as well. Don't worry. But it's like outside of that little motherfucker. I don't have [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=1457.92s)]
*  to, you know, everything's pretty like, I can't even imagine with a family. And that goes with [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=1463.8400000000001s)]
*  you everywhere as well. You can't even leave her at home if you want to go out on the road. [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=1468.48s)]
*  So how many children do you have? I have two that came out of me, but I also have two stepdaughters [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=1473.28s)]
*  that I've had for 20 years. Yeah. Like in Cinderella, are those stepdaughters? I am Cinderella. [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=1478.64s)]
*  Yeah. I'm Cinderella. Of course. I've had the girls since they were two and four. They're now [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=1483.44s)]
*  21 and 23. Okay. So they're not at the house like asking for sandwiches and all. Oh, fuck no. When [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=1488.24s)]

*  do you mean? I went, consider yourself raised. Get the fuck out. Out. I love you out. And she was like, [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=1504.3999999999999s)]
*  happy to like, yeah, get out. I'm done. I'm open this women's door for you. Yeah, exactly. Watch. [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=1510.0s)]

*  have that? Do they have a concept of it? Or I think they say, no, not. Well, I think they see it [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=1534.0s)]
*  as my job. I will say though, that my 12 year old, my kids are really fucking funny too. Like [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=1540.0s)]
*  I don't think anything's funny. I think they're fucking funny. Oh yeah. It's really cool. So now [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=1549.68s)]

*  When you're, if your kids start saying, and your, your kids start entertaining you kind of low key, [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=1571.76s)]
*  that must be interesting because then it's like, Oh, I made that. Absolutely. Yeah. But then when [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=1575.76s)]
*  they're really annoying, I'm like, Oh, I fucking did that too. Oh yeah. Like I say, you know, a lot of [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=1581.92s)]

*  I come to Sydney for a month and I say to my husband, fucking sucked in, enjoy that. Or I [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=1621.92s)]

*  was going out of business. Did you ever go with that? I did Montreal a couple of times. [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=1896.24s)]
*  You did? Yeah. Yeah, I only heard that the other day. [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=1900.32s)]
*  2024 Just For Laughs Comedy Festival canceled. Company seeks creditor protection. Wow. [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=1904.6399999999999s)]
*  I can, yeah, it keeps rolling. Is that just in Montreal? Because we have one in Australia. We [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=1910.48s)]
*  have in Sydney, JFL. Has that been canceled? Good question. The Montreal company that operates [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=1916.56s)]
*  the Just For Laughs Comedy Festival has canceled the 2024 edition of the event. Wow. So 2024 [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=1921.52s)]
*  Montreal is canceled. Which when is, sorry, I'm learning things today. When is it usually on? I [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=1926.48s)]
*  should know. I've played it. I believe it's in. In like a few months, right? So that's late to cancel. [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=1933.36s)]
*  Like is everyone, fuck that. They must have made just realized it's not going to work. A formal [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=1938.6399999999999s)]

*  to make a proposal to creditors. 75 people were laid off Tuesday morning, according to a festival [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=1949.04s)]
*  spokesperson who called the company's financial situation unsustainable. Yeah, festivals are [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=1954.72s)]
*  tricky. The company cited lost revenues during the two years of the global pandemic and challenges [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=1959.36s)]
*  facing the media industry, particularly reduced budgets at networks and streaming platforms [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=1965.52s)]

*  But I think like things like Just For Laughs, they're not as much of a launching pad for [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=1976.08s)]
*  entertainment anymore, for comedians. And that not, it's not a money making vehicle. Like I don't, [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=1982.4s)]
*  I've always found it quite weird. I don't really do festivals again, because, you know, I didn't [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=1988.24s)]
*  come up through stand up, but that idea of going, there's 300 shows on over four days. [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=1993.36s)]
*  Yes, too much. In two, two streets, two blocks. And each comedian's got to try and push their own [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=2000.0s)]
*  fucking show up against that. Like I didn't, I always found it kind of weird. And I know so many [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=2007.36s)]
*  of my mates do those festivals. Like it's fucking impossible to sell, try and sell out even, you [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=2013.84s)]
*  know, 300 seats. It's impossible because my mates down the street, it's just, yeah, it's really hard. [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=2019.68s)]
*  Every venue in the world is selling tickets on the same night. It almost does seem kind of ridiculous. [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=2025.92s)]
*  It's like, what if all your major sports teams played on the same night? [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=2030.72s)]
*  Exactly. Well, they'd never do that with sport. No, not sacred sport, but with the arts and comedy. [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=2034.0s)]
*  Fucking hell. Figure it out, you weirdos. We don't give a shit. Sport! [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=2040.0s)]
*  We went to a Sydney Swans game yesterday. Yeah. Good. Like it? Yeah. It was cool. AFL. [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=2044.24s)]
*  Yeah. AFL. It's like soccer and rugby kind of a little bit. It's um... [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=2051.52s)]
*  Yeah. Rugby union. Do you mean? Not rugby league. [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=2057.76s)]
*  I don't know. I couldn't tell what the, it's kind of an interesting sport. You can't tell what sport [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=2062.0s)]
*  it is. It seems like they're trying to play every sport at once. And they're incredible. Like I don't [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=2066.72s)]
*  really follow AFL, but when I do see it and talking to people who love it, they're incredible fucking [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=2072.16s)]
*  athletes. They just never stop just pinning it around and throwing and kicking. Like it's not [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=2079.2799999999997s)]
*  you run, you stop, you sit, you go again. Like it's nonstop. It's amazing to watch. [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=2085.6s)]
*  Yeah. It kind of has like a soccer aspect because it keeps moving. Do your boys play sports or no? [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=2090.16s)]
*  Yeah. My oldest boy loves rugby league, but I've pulled him out. Well, he's not going to do it for [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=2096.16s)]
*  a year. He wants to, you know, get his shit together. So we started doing rugby union instead. [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=2101.6s)]
*  I fucking hate it. What is rugby union? What's the difference? [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=2106.56s)]
*  Oh, could someone else bring this up? Here we go. Rugby league is... I don't know how to describe [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=2110.4s)]
*  the difference because if you watch it, it looks very similar. There's, oh, everyone listening who [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=2117.6s)]
*  knows sports is going to be like this bitch trying to tell us about fucking union. Listen up fellas. [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=2122.4s)]
*  This is how it is. No, it's International Women's Day. You're good. [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=2127.12s)]
*  I know I'm bored because it's sport. But um... [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=2130.48s)]
*  Well, there you go. Did you play sports when you were growing up? [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=2133.2s)]
*  No. [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=2135.84s)]
*  Really? [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=2136.4s)]
*  I danced. [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=2137.04s)]
*  You did? [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=2137.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=2138.4s)]
*  You were a trained dancer. [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=2139.04s)]
*  Sure. Not trained, but like as a kid, dance, you know, every day of my life up until I was 16, [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=2140.56s)]
*  fucking loved it. [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=2147.68s)]
*  Oh, it's beautiful. [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=2148.48s)]
*  Well, my main goal in life was to be a Janet Jackson backup dancer. [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=2149.36s)]
*  Oh. [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=2152.4s)]
*  I love her so much. [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=2152.9s)]
*  God, it's so beautiful. Yeah. I have never met her before. I've had dreams where I've met [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=2154.48s)]
*  Tito Jackson. [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=2161.44s)]
*  Oh, how'd that go? [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=2162.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=2165.44s)]
*  It was like a recovery meeting, but I still got to meet, I got introduced to him twice. [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=2166.16s)]
*  In these dreams? [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=2170.2400000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=2171.28s)]
*  Yeah, right. It's very specific. [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=2171.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=2174.48s)]
*  Now I'm obsessed with Janet. I saw her 1998 Velvet Rope Tour in Brisbane. [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=2175.68s)]
*  Nuh-uh. [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=2180.08s)]
*  Changed my fucking life. [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=2180.64s)]
*  Where were you at? [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=2181.92s)]
*  Where was my seat? Like, row Z, seat 87. [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=2183.36s)]
*  Fuck yeah. [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=2186.56s)]
*  What had a better seat in the fucking car park. I didn't care. Changed my life. [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=2186.72s)]
*  And what were you wearing? Just your young breasts? [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=2189.52s)]
*  Yeah. Just baby tits and jeans. [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=2192.08s)]
*  I don't know if we can say that to her. [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=2196.24s)]
*  We probably won't say that, I reckon. [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=2197.44s)]
*  I'm happy to stay for the edit, if that helps. I'm available all of a sudden. [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=2200.96s)]
*  No, I'm obsessed with her, but even more so her backup dancers. [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=2206.56s)]
*  Yeah. Because it's so much to be a backup dancer because you're right there. [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=2209.7599999999998s)]
*  You're right on the cusp of the star. You're smelling their fucking breath. [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=2213.7599999999998s)]
*  Yeah, but you- [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=2217.52s)]
*  If they fart, you're in it. [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=2218.0s)]
*  Absolutely. But you need to know your place. [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=2219.76s)]
*  So you need to know that when Janet breaks off from the group and does her thing, [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=2224.8s)]
*  that's when you can go. And you know if I can go ham. [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=2230.24s)]
*  But when she comes back, you've got to make sure you fall in line. [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=2232.64s)]
*  I think a lot about Taylor Swift's backup dancers. [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=2235.12s)]
*  I think about them a lot. I went and saw her a few weeks ago. [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=2239.52s)]
*  You did? [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=2241.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=2242.4s)]
*  And did you go alone? [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=2243.28s)]
*  No, I took my nine-year-old niece. [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=2245.04s)]
*  Beautiful. [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=2247.2s)]
*  Yeah, I'm pretty amazing. [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=2248.24s)]
*  Do you think some women went alone? [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=2249.12s)]
*  No. No, I think people went in fucking cults together to that. [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=2252.7999999999997s)]
*  With their cauldrons, huh? [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=2261.92s)]
*  Oh, fucking hell. No, I don't think there was anyone there alone. [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=2263.44s)]
*  And if they went alone, they didn't leave alone. [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=2266.56s)]
*  Like it was a lot. But I think about her backup dancers. [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=2268.8799999999997s)]
*  She's on tour at the moment, biggest tour in history. [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=2272.56s)]
*  And Beyonce's on tour, biggest tour in history. [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=2275.84s)]
*  And you just fucking know that Taylor Swift backup dancers [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=2278.4s)]
*  also auditioned for that Beyonce tour. [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=2281.92s)]
*  That's tough. There's a lot of skipping around. [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=2285.84s)]
*  They come out on push bikes. They bring out pumpkins and do like liturgical. [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=2288.88s)]
*  It's a it's I was like. [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=2292.88s)]
*  You don't notice half the shit they do. [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=2294.08s)]
*  Next thing you know, one of them, yeah, just has like a, [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=2295.6s)]
*  they'll have a stuffed animal. They'll have a bassinet. [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=2299.04s)]
*  100%. [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=2301.36s)]
*  You know, one of them will have a drum. [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=2302.32s)]
*  One of them will be just, you know, landing their ass on the other one or something. [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=2303.68s)]
*  You just and before you know it, it just they they have to keep it moving. [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=2307.52s)]
*  But you re I really noticed it. [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=2310.96s)]
*  And I really noticed the backup dancers when Taylor would dance with them. [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=2313.12s)]
*  I'm like, oh, that's I want to re-chore that. [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=2316.3999999999996s)]
*  And be right there. [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=2320.72s)]
*  And Taylor's unbelievable. Obsessed with her. [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=2321.6s)]
*  I think she's incredible. Is she a dancer? [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=2323.44s)]
*  No, mate, she's not a dancer. [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=2327.12s)]
*  But she is a hype woman. [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=2328.96s)]
*  Yeah. And she dances in front of 100,000 people the way that I used to dance in my [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=2330.88s)]
*  bedroom alone when I was nine. And I have fucking respect for that. [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=2334.88s)]
*  That's what I think it is. [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=2338.0s)]
*  I think even when you see her just like at other shows, you see her dancing. [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=2339.12s)]
*  You see her having a good time. [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=2343.28s)]
*  She's all teeth and elbows. [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=2344.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=2345.36s)]
*  But you go great. I love that for you. [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=2345.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=2349.04s)]
*  Those backup dancers. [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=2349.28s)]
*  You think some of them like that could be me. [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=2352.6400000000003s)]
*  Do you think some of them have to leave the tour because their ego gets too big? [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=2354.32s)]
*  I reckon some of them have to do a drop in dance class once a week just to really hone [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=2358.16s)]
*  their craft because they're not getting it on stage. [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=2361.76s)]
*  Yeah. They have to dumb it down almost, huh? [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=2364.7200000000003s)]
*  Maybe. Yeah. You got to be careful what you say about Taylor. [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=2367.52s)]
*  Because the Swifties will come for you and skin you alive. [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=2371.04s)]
*  Really? Are they bad here? [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=2374.08s)]
*  I'm not worried for you. I'm fucking worried for me. [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=2374.64s)]
*  You talked about tits on a baby. You're already fucked. [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=2378.16s)]
*  But I go for Taylor. [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=2380.48s)]
*  I don't think we should. [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=2382.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=2384.0s)]
*  No, that's good. [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=2384.4s)]
*  I'm okay with a lot of surgeries. I don't think that's one of them. [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=2385.04s)]
*  No, Taylor. Yeah. I think she's great. I just don't know if she's a dancer. [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=2390.48s)]
*  Some of the stuff you see at the shows is you will see a lot of people filming their child, [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=2395.36s)]
*  trying to get their child on to like, look, Taylor, this is little Dino or whatever. [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=2400.88s)]
*  Phoebe. Yeah. [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=2408.4s)]
*  Yeah. You know, yeah, this is Chloe and she's your, you know, [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=2409.2799999999997s)]
*  Biggest fan. [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=2412.56s)]
*  Biggest fan and she's like eating a bowl of fucking glitter or something. [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=2413.6s)]
*  Tears. Yeah. Tears and resentment. Three and a half hour concert. [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=2416.56s)]
*  Wow. [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=2420.7999999999997s)]
*  Fucking hell, that's a lot. I went to the bathroom at one point and I came back to my niece [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=2422.24s)]
*  and I said, oh, Taylor's, she got changed during this song. And my niece went, no, [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=2428.48s)]
*  it's a different song. And I went, it's fucking not. It's all the same. I thought it was the same [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=2434.7999999999997s)]
*  song. She's like, no, it's a completely different song. [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=2440.48s)]
*  Oh yeah. Yeah. I was so high. One time I went to green day and the opening band performed [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=2442.7999999999997s)]
*  and I thought that was green day. And I was, who was your opening band? Dua Lipa or something. [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=2447.7599999999998s)]
*  I think it was like Chingy or something. Oh, wow. Did you leave after it? That was great. [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=2454.16s)]
*  That was great. There's heaps of cabs available like an Uber. This is awesome. [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=2459.04s)]
*  I was on my way out. What else is going on? Oh yeah. So one thing that people love about [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=2463.6s)]
*  you obviously so much is just like, like bucking, like the beauty trend and like taking on beauty [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=2470.32s)]
*  in like such a ridiculous way. Is it like beauty kind of, or is it just like, what is like the [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=2475.44s)]
*  fulcrum of like what you feel like you kind of like, like to pinpoint? Cause you have so many [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=2482.6400000000003s)]
*  videos of shit that's like, yeah, like somebody in the rain drinking a soda, just like things. [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=2488.48s)]
*  It's like that normally they make it look all sexy and erotic, you know, and you just kind of [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=2494.0s)]
*  make it look like real humans. Like what if we all did this? Yeah. I think because kind of like [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=2499.44s)]
*  Taylor Swift's dancing. Exactly the same. Taylor and I are the same. We're exactly the same, [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=2503.44s)]
*  but we're like in dance. I think just that whole idea of unrealistic ideals of women being sold [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=2508.08s)]
*  as realistic. Yeah. Like before social media, you know, you get a magazine or whatever you see in [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=2518.88s)]
*  the media magazine drawing yourself. Yeah. You're like, Oh, it's Cindy Crawford being fucking amazing. [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=2526.72s)]
*  She's on a motorbike on it in a bikini on Empire State building, drinking a Pepsi. You know what [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=2532.16s)]
*  that is. It's an edited thing and that's what it's been sold as then kind of social media came out [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=2538.56s)]
*  and similar ideas are being pushed, but it's like, this is what I look like dropping the kids off at [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=2543.8399999999997s)]
*  school or like, this is my morning routine and it's 4am and she's in a bikini and she's doing yoga [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=2550.48s)]
*  on a beach. She's got a green juice and a kid's, you know, gorgeous and just doing school drop off. [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=2556.48s)]
*  I'm like, bitch, that's not what fucking school drop off looks like. That idea of it being sold [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=2561.6s)]
*  as it just, it's trash. It's just, you know, it's fucking hard because then when you get it on your [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=2566.88s)]
*  phone, you already hate yourself and it's 3am and you're breastfeeding your child who won't fucking [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=2573.84s)]
*  breastfeed, but you have to breastfeed them because if you don't breastfeed them, you're a shit mom. [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=2580.32s)]
*  You may as well give them a fucking meth pipe because that's something else we have to be doing. [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=2583.6s)]
*  And he's also 11, which is a little crazy. [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=2586.7999999999997s)]
*  Exactly. And he fucking hates you. Yeah. And you're scrolling through your phone and then you see [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=2588.96s)]
*  these images and they get into that psyche. I was like, that's bullshit. [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=2594.7999999999997s)]
*  Oh yeah. It's like, why do I have to feel bad suddenly? [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=2598.64s)]
*  I already feel bad, but at least I could put the fucking magazine down or turn the fucking TV off. [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=2600.56s)]
*  Yeah. And then we get these in our hands and you put that down, you'll fucking explode [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=2605.2s)]
*  and they just peppered. And I was like, no, I call bullshit to that. I call absolute bullshit. [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=2613.04s)]
*  I still do. Yeah. And then here's the worst part is I think that then your brain starts to feel bad [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=2618.1600000000003s)]
*  or something. Then you release some like thing in your breast milk and now your kid fucking feels bad. [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=2623.2000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely. Your kid's all fucking pissed or whatever. 100%. [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=2628.56s)]
*  Because some chick with no kids is fucking, you know, showing her tits and you're a toaster oven [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=2632.48s)]
*  or whatever making breakfast. Yeah, exactly. She's not making that breakfast. But I also wanted to [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=2638.32s)]
*  show the other, like I'm sure there are people out there that do sail on a yacht to drop their [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=2646.0800000000004s)]
*  kids off to school in bikinis and incredible, but not everyone's like that. And that's not [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=2652.0800000000004s)]
*  represented. It's not represented. So kind of true, huh? Why do we get afraid? I think to share [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=2657.28s)]
*  whatever is probably really real, I guess. I think it's shifting though. Yeah. [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=2662.48s)]
*  And I think maybe because it's boring, it's not aspirational and we have to constantly, [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=2669.92s)]
*  especially if, you know, in the public eye or in the media, got to be aspirational. Someone asked [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=2676.56s)]
*  me an interview yesterday, well, what's next? You know, you got a world tour, you're doing this, [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=2682.4s)]
*  you're doing that. So I'm going to lie the fuck down. Yeah. That's what I want to do. I want to [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=2685.6s)]
*  try and figure out how to live one day without anxiety and sleep for longer than four hours. [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=2690.0s)]
*  Oh yeah. Like that's a goal of mine. It doesn't always have to be I'm going to do this, I'm going [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=2696.64s)]
*  to do that, I'm going to do this. And that's the stuff for social media too. Yeah. Well, I think [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=2702.08s)]
*  there's, it definitely creates a world of like, I have to do something else. Yeah. What's next? [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=2707.2000000000003s)]
*  What's next? Because people have seen it next, seen it next, seen it next. Even like in TV now [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=2714.0s)]
*  with streamers consume television on streaming services the way we consume TikTok. And we, [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=2718.08s)]
*  and this is one of the craziest things that happened. You start to not even value, you don't [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=2725.52s)]
*  even realize how much production goes into television stuff. So people don't even value [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=2729.2s)]
*  it as much anymore. They value it as like, if this doesn't get my attention pretty quick, or I'm not [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=2734.64s)]
*  in, I move on. And it's almost like you scroll past it and to think that that much production and [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=2739.04s)]
*  time and creativity and everything would go into a program and you would just scroll right past it. [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=2745.84s)]
*  It's one of the reasons I think why like even JFL are saying that there's problems because [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=2753.92s)]
*  there's just tightening budgets at all those places because they, they can't figure out how to make it [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=2758.8s)]
*  where people are sticking around, you know? Yeah. And people want everything for free, but that's, [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=2766.0s)]
*  you know, that's what the industry and you know, society, social media, all that sort of stuff is [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=2770.48s)]
*  put out there. It's like, if you don't binge this show in two days, you're a fucking idiot because [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=2777.12s)]
*  we've got 40 other shows that are coming up that everyone else is watching. So you have to, you [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=2781.8399999999997s)]
*  have to kind of keep up watching it. And if you don't, well then aren't you a loser? How dare you [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=2786.3199999999997s)]
*  watch one episode a day, fuckhead? That's the whole thing. And then it totally- [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=2791.68s)]
*  It really cares if your children can't read. You need this fucking second episode of Griselda, [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=2798.16s)]
*  you little bitch. Yeah. Bridgerton 65 is coming out. You're not onto it yet. And that's, I think [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=2802.72s)]
*  that really dilutes the quality of what we see because Bridgerton, for example, you watch that, [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=2808.0s)]
*  it drops and you binge it in two days and then everyone loves it. And they're like, you have to [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=2815.04s)]
*  make another one. So instead of going, all right, well, let's go and develop some scripts. We'll get [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=2822.08s)]
*  some writers out. Oh, we're going to, you know, what draft do you usually shoot on? Oh, 10th draft. [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=2825.84s)]
*  Fuck that. Second draft, shooting draft. Go, go. Elizabeth needs yellow fever or whoever the [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=2830.4s)]
*  characters are. Yeah, exactly. And just absolutely dilute the quality of it. Put Bridgerton in a [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=2835.6800000000003s)]
*  fucking coma and let's fucking keep it moving. Episode one, but episode two, fucking bring them [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=2840.32s)]
*  out. Keep going. Yeah. Things start to lose quality because we want things so fast. Yeah. [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=2845.6800000000003s)]
*  Yeah. It used to be, you know, it's always been a tough industry and challenging. Kind of like [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=2850.88s)]
*  that about it, but it's fucking brutal now. Like, and what is the acting side? Yeah. Trying to get, [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=2858.0s)]
*  that seems impossible. Trying to, like I had a show on Netflix that went really well. It fucking [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=2864.32s)]
*  killed. Yeah. Well made. Yeah. It went really well and it didn't get renewed. And I, and, and they [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=2869.44s)]
*  said because of numbers, but the numbers were really good. You just have to keep up and it's, [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=2877.36s)]
*  you can only control that so much. And a lot of these people making those choices have no idea. [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=2882.8s)]
*  Or accountants. They're, well, they are just P, yeah, they're, they have no idea what's cool. [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=2889.28s)]
*  And that's one of the, also one of the things that I do like about people being able to make [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=2895.52s)]
*  their own content and have their own voices because those people thought they knew everything. [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=2900.88s)]
*  Yeah. And they don't know shit. No. And now their old festivals are falling apart. [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=2908.2400000000002s)]
*  Their networks are making shit that nobody's paying attention to. I think it's, I think it's [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=2914.0s)]
*  part of the problem. I mean, I'm probably a little jaded too, you know, similar thing happened to me, [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=2921.76s)]
*  but it's like, um, they tried to get so woe. I don't know. And the U S like the comedy central [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=2926.0s)]
*  got so woke and everything they put on people that weren't even fucking comedians making shows. [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=2931.84s)]
*  It was just like, and it, and then now they'll like give, they, they want to come in and offer [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=2935.84s)]
*  you like $500 to come make a show with them. Like get fucked. Yeah. Like, yeah. With your special. [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=2940.8s)]
*  Absolutely. Yeah. They're like, we're going to give you 16 cents for your special. I'm like the one [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=2946.96s)]
*  that I sold out worldwide and made a fuck ton of money on. You can't have that. You can't have that. [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=2950.96s)]
*  Um, yeah. Was that, did that feel kind of scary? Because I guess when you're an actor, [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=2957.36s)]
*  getting a show is such a huge thing. Huh? It was awesome. I fucking loved it. It was so fun. I [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=2962.08s)]
*  haven't seen it. I just saw that you had, I know that you did it and that's all I know. [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=2967.2s)]
*  I was executive producer on it as well, which I fucking loved. Really? Did you get one of those [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=2970.32s)]
*  little chairs with the black back on it? No, I didn't fucking hell. I should have got that. [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=2974.32s)]
*  Oh, well I got an ego though. Yeah. Massive ego from it. I just loved it. I was, you know, [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=2979.52s)]
*  it was a show that was built around me. It was a, it was a dream situation. It was a book. Oh. [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=2984.8s)]
*  That was then turned into a show and they wanted to build it around me and had awesome people on [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=2990.32s)]
*  it and we made it and it was fucking wicked. I loved it. I loved it. I loved the story as well [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=2995.76s)]
*  of being a woman, 41 now, you know, on screen being big and loud and flawed and annoying and [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=3002.16s)]
*  weird and exciting. And then before we're talking about audiences and people come up to me in the [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=3008.7999999999997s)]
*  street and just like women, they're like, I fucking saw myself in that character. We don't see that [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=3016.0s)]
*  much. Right. And so I love that. So I really, really would have loved to have extended that [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=3020.24s)]
*  given more to that story and seen more in that character as well as being the lead in a fucking [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=3027.44s)]
*  show for a second season and executive producer. Like I'm not hiding that. I enjoyed that. Yeah. [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=3032.56s)]

*  because I don't think he does much. I don't think he does a lot of stuff like that. I felt [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=3202.16s)]
*  super stoked about it. I'm going to try to get to say hey to him before I leave town. [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=3206.64s)]

*  Really? [[01:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=3699.52s)]

*  just so you know, this term we're doing, like sex ed, we're going to be talking about. [[01:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=3703.04s)]

*  Yeah, they know. But I think sex ed is when it gets really weird because then it's like, [[01:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=3718.4s)]
*  somebody is talking about it and everybody's in the same room at the same time. [[01:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=3723.6000000000004s)]

*  I'm like, people are like, abusing this doll kind of like, and there was a male doll and a female doll. [[01:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=3734.88s)]
*  But I think it's because you remember that energy. Did you have to go to sex ed? [[01:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=3742.48s)]
*  I don't remember it at all. [[01:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=3745.6000000000004s)]
*  What? [[01:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=3748.4s)]

*  We have this thing in Australia called Healthy Harold. And this fucking van comes around to [[01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=3753.06s)]
*  each school. And Harold is the character. He's a giraffe. And you go into the Healthy Harold van [[01:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=3759.86s)]
*  and they have like figurines. And it's like, this is what a uterus looks like. Or like, [[01:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=3768.6600000000003s)]

*  But then I remember Healthy Harold comes. It's a lot. And then Healthy Harold comes back and [[01:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=3779.54s)]
*  then they talk about sex ed. And I didn't, maybe I didn't go. Isn't that weird? I don't remember [[01:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=3786.18s)]
*  the whole, you know, healthy Harold condom on a banana thing. I don't remember any of that. [[01:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=3793.38s)]

*  Yeah. Well, that's, that's pretty interesting that they use a giraffe to do it. And he comes [[01:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=3803.94s)]
*  around. And my poppy's name was Harold as well. So I was like, I'm fucking good not learning about [[01:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=3809.54s)]
*  this in a weird dark van. [[01:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=3813.7799999999997s)]

*  about sex. Yeah. You just need to get parents to sign off on it. [[01:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=3828.74s)]

*  yeah, people are putting snails and this must be a, this is Asian thing. Yeah. Popularizing [[01:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=4016.6600000000003s)]
*  Korea spread across Asia. The texture of the snail slime on your face is already giving us [[01:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=4020.98s)]
*  the hibby gibbies. Actually a snail on your face would feel fucking wild. Yeah. I can feel that in [[01:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=4025.06s)]
*  a very specific part of my spine. That's weird. It would be the actual, for me, the slow movement [[01:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=4032.2599999999998s)]
*  of the snail. I'm just not interested. I would, I'm happy. I would rather look like a hat full of [[01:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=4039.7s)]
*  assholes than fucking sit through that. I'm not doing that. And it's not even a movement. It's [[01:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=4044.66s)]
*  just a casual, like never ending. Yeah. Oh, that seems kind of nice. I think it depends on where [[01:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=4049.22s)]
*  you put it at. Yeah. It was quite nice. Yeah. Like I don't know if it's soothing or not though. [[01:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=4057.9399999999996s)]
*  You know what my friend Caleb told me? He told me that this is the neatest thing I've ever heard [[01:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=4064.2599999999998s)]
*  that you can look at anything and know what it will feel like on your tongue. [[01:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=4068.74s)]
*  Because when you were a baby, you put everything in your mouth. [[01:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=4074.74s)]
*  What? I can look at anything. Like you can look at anything, like material or anything, [[01:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=4081.62s)]
*  and you can know what it feels like on your tongue. Yeah, right. That's kind of cool. [[01:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=4086.98s)]
*  It's crazy. You can look at anything. You're like, [[01:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=4091.54s)]
*  but he said it's because you tried everything when you were a child. [[01:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=4095.7799999999997s)]
*  But it doesn't kind of check out because like when I look at those lights, [[01:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=4098.82s)]
*  I know how it feels on my tongue, but that's not because I shove lights in my face as a baby. [[01:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=4102.74s)]
*  Maybe not, but do you shove certain fat? It's just like, did we taste every fat? You know what I'm [[01:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=4106.58s)]
*  saying? Did we taste every surface without even, you know? Yeah. Sand, all that shit. Yeah. Yeah. [[01:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=4110.42s)]
*  Because it's weird. You can, once I start thinking about it, you're like- [[01:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=4115.0599999999995s)]
*  You're now kind of freaking out a little bit, like looking around. [[01:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=4118.179999999999s)]
*  Like how does our tongue know everything? And I think sometimes, I said this to my kids the [[01:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=4121.0599999999995s)]
*  other day, sometimes when I've got so much on and because I've got ADHD as well, when I'm really [[01:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=4125.94s)]
*  overwhelmed, I can feel the front part of my brain. I can actually feel it. And when I think [[01:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=4134.339999999999s)]
*  about that, I'm like, what other parts of me, if I think hard enough about them, can I feel that [[01:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=4141.86s)]
*  you don't usually think about? Do you know what I mean? Like same with if I had a drink of water or [[01:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=4148.419999999999s)]
*  something free and then someone tried to talk to me and I had to answer them and I couldn't swallow [[01:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=4153.22s)]
*  and I was like, going, hang on. And then I went, I forgot how to fucking swallow all of a sudden [[01:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=4158.820000000001s)]
*  because- Don't say that. Because you don't have to think about swallowing, right? It just happens. [[01:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=4164.9800000000005s)]
*  So when you do think about it, you forget how to do it. I'm boring myself, but sometimes I can feel [[01:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=4170.02s)]
*  the front part of my brain when I'm overthinking. And I feel it's the same thing about that tongue [[01:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=4175.780000000001s)]
*  thing. I don't usually think that I can feel my tongue until I think about it. We're going to [[01:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=4180.98s)]
*  put this part on the calm app to put people to sleep. Yeah, welcome to calm app. We will make a [[01:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=4186.099999999999s)]
*  good call map episode. I'm so fucking sick of myself. Jesus Christ. Welcome to calm app. [[01:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=4191.219999999999s)]
*  So this is going to tell you about the front part of a fucking brain to put you to sleep. [[01:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=4195.139999999999s)]
*  You're in a beautiful open field. What's that a bird? What does that feel like on your tongue? [[01:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=4198.5s)]
*  Calm down. If we made a calm app episode, that'd be so fire. Yeah. It'd be so good. Wouldn't it? [[01:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=4208.34s)]
*  Harry Styles is on it. He's on there doing calm app shit. Yeah, but it's fucking great because he [[01:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=4215.9400000000005s)]
*  reads you like a story. And at the beginning of it, he's like, hello, Harry Styles here. I'm going [[01:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=4221.7s)]
*  to read you a story. And I'm like, fuck, all right, Harry, why don't you read me a little story. [[01:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=4229.3s)]
*  It's really nice. Wow. Yeah. Yeah, that'd be good. I'm trying to think of some good ones. I would [[01:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=4235.3s)]
*  like to hear maybe from Randy Quaid, maybe LeBron does want to. He does. Yeah, it's good. I feel [[01:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=4241.3s)]
*  like if Kaiss and that did one, it would be pretty fucking fire too. But yeah, I don't know for what [[01:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=4248.0199999999995s)]
*  his would be like. Maybe that would be great if everybody started making those. Lots of people [[01:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=4252.26s)]
*  do them. Yeah. Like I was quite surprised when I saw it. Like, fuck, there must be money in that. [[01:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=4257.78s)]
*  Do you do any impressions or impersonations kind of? I'm not that talented, unfortunately. [[01:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=4263.54s)]
*  Did you ever try them? Like try to work on it for a while or think about it? No, no, not really. [[01:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=4269.3s)]
*  I kind of had a little moment of wanting to do SNL back in the day before anyone gave a shit about [[01:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=4274.9s)]
*  who I was. But I was like, I'm not really good at that stuff. I fucking think it's amazing though. [[01:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=4280.099999999999s)]
*  People that do it blows my mind. Did you see Shane Gillis on there? No, he's an American comedian. [[01:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=4284.34s)]
*  He's like a really entertaining guy, very funny. He just, he had gotten kicked off of the show. [[01:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=4290.34s)]
*  Like they had hired him. As a cast member. They hired him as a cast member a while, [[01:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=4296.42s)]
*  like three years ago. And then the next day they looked at some old episode from a podcast or [[01:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=4300.900000000001s)]
*  something and said something on it and they took him off. They said, we changed our minds. And then [[01:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=4306.82s)]
*  he blew up since then and he has like a huge career. And now they just had him back as a guest. [[01:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=4313.62s)]
*  Oh wow. So did he host? Yeah, he hosted. Yeah, right. So I thought it was interesting. I thought [[01:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=4318.5s)]
*  he was going to say at the last minute. Fuck you. Can't make it guys. Yeah. Yeah. Wow. I kind of [[01:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=4323.7s)]
*  wish that he would, but I don't know if that's just like a petty part of me that wished that. [[01:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=4329.46s)]
*  I have that in me as well. Yeah. Sometimes that petty part of you just shows up, you know? [[01:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=4332.98s)]
*  Oh God. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Quite a lot for me. Does it feel like, um, [[01:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=4337.38s)]
*  um, Jesus. Air conditioning. Yeah. Um, does it feel, is it really you think? [[01:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=4342.58s)]
*  What? Like now when you think about it, cause you've been traveling a lot, right? You're in hotels, [[01:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=4351.62s)]
*  you're on planes. It just like, my voice is busted. So that when I tour the same thing, [[01:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=4356.26s)]
*  it's the air conditioning, just cold, synthetic air. It's never right. Is it? No. That's why when [[01:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=4361.78s)]
*  you, I get hotel rooms, I always try to get, I can open a fucking window. Yeah. Cause it's been, [[01:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=4367.54s)]
*  like I say, four days I've been in a hotel or in a car or anything like that, or, you know, [[01:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=4371.86s)]
*  studios are cold. So yeah, it just busts my voice. Sometimes when I go to certain places, [[01:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=4376.66s)]
*  I'll stay in a place that doesn't have any air condition. And at first you're like, this sucks. [[01:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=4381.54s)]
*  But by like the second night, you kind of get into like this real natural sort of pattern kind [[01:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=4387.62s)]
*  of. Yeah. And your body kind of self regulates itself with hate and everything. So much better [[01:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=4392.179999999999s)]
*  for you. But yeah, it just, it buckles my voice. I'm actually going to have some free water. [[01:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=4397.22s)]
*  Did you see, well, you said you have ADHD, huh? And how'd you get it? [[01:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=4403.54s)]
*  Just bought it at the store. Just go down and fucking pick it up. [[01:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=4410.900000000001s)]
*  I thought it's not something that's developed. [[01:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=4414.66s)]
*  No, born with it. Well, I don't think I was born with it. I was diagnosed at 16, [[01:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=4416.26s)]
*  been medicated on and off for ever. I fucking hate it. [[01:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=4421.459999999999s)]
*  You really? [[01:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=4426.0199999999995s)]
*  Yeah. I really struggle with it. I find it really hard. [[01:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=4426.5s)]
*  Like how do you notice it? Cause sometimes I wonder, how do you notice it? Like where do you [[01:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=4430.099999999999s)]
*  know, where do you notice it? Cause 16 is kind of a young age to diagnose somebody with something, [[01:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=4434.74s)]
*  but that's how we do it. [[01:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=4439.139999999999s)]
*  And especially in the nineties as well. Like it's everywhere now, which is great. [[01:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=4440.419999999999s)]
*  There's, you know, people talk about it so much now, but back then ADHD was just like, shut up [[01:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=4445.219999999999s)]
*  and sit down, have a pill, fuck off. It's not just a hyperactivity thing. It's lacking in [[01:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=4450.42s)]
*  dopamine and all that. And I just, I just run in circles. I can't grab a thought. [[01:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=4455.46s)]
*  I find it as I get older, it's kind of getting harder. It's weird. Like, as I say, I'm medicated [[01:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=4463.06s)]
*  for it, but I get the medication makes me anxious. So it's like, well, which fucking [[01:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=4470.02s)]
*  devil do you choose to hang out with? You're going to be like, well, I'll just be scattered and full [[01:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=4478.900000000001s)]
*  on or not as scattered, not as full on, but anxious as fuck. And I don't know if it's a career [[01:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=4484.18s)]
*  thing as well, you know, with more success and all that with so much going on and so much demand, [[01:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=4492.42s)]
*  but I find it hard to cop a break with it. It bums me hard. See all this stuff online and people [[01:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=4498.34s)]
*  are like, ADHD, you know, it's my, I find it, it's like my superpower. And I'm like, fuck you. [[01:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=4503.78s)]
*  I don't find that at all. People, again, I think it might be a social media thing. It's like, [[01:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=4511.0599999999995s)]
*  it's great. It means I can do that and do that and do that and do that. I'm like, I can't do that [[01:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=4516.259999999999s)]
*  or that or half of that or any of that. And, and, and I've got a heap of people that work for me [[01:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=4520.9s)]
*  and I fucking hate them all because they don't do enough for me. They do it like it's just, [[01:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=4526.179999999999s)]
*  I find it exhausting and it's the dopamine thing. I don't, we don't produce dopamine, [[01:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=4530.099999999999s)]
*  that fucking drug that makes you happy. And it, it's, it's just, it's hard. I find it really, [[01:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=4537.46s)]
*  really hard. So people with ADHD don't produce dopamine? I think we just don't quite, I think [[01:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=4545.54s)]
*  we are, it's harder. It's a lot harder for us to produce dopamine. Like 10 times harder, I think it [[01:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=4553.139999999999s)]
*  is. And I, and I really, I feel that on a fucking cellular level, trying to write a standup show. [[01:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=4559.22s)]
*  Like you need the dopamine, you need the excitement. I need a brain that can work, [[01:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=4567.62s)]
*  that can go, that's funny. That's funny. Bring it in. People with ADHD have at least one defective [[01:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=4573.3s)]
*  gene. Oh damn, your shit's messed up. Yeah, we're fucking, the DRD2 gene makes it difficult for [[01:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=4579.94s)]
*  neurons to respond to dopamine, the neurotransmitter that has evolved in feelings of pleasure and the [[01:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=4586.66s)]
*  regulation of attention. Can you please tell me, can you please tell me what, see, I have to read [[01:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=4591.38s)]
*  it again. Can you please tell me what the DRD2 gene is? Is that just, I wonder if that's what's [[01:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=4596.66s)]
*  in your Ritlin? Dopamine receptor D2, also known as D2R is a protein that in humans is encoded by [[01:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=4604.98s)]
*  the DRD2 gene. Yeah, dopamine. The dopamine D2 receptor is the main receptor for most anti-psychotic [[01:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=4612.82s)]
*  drugs. The structure of DR2 in complex with the atypical, it's not helping me. No, so many words [[01:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=4622.179999999999s)]
*  for me right now. Yeah, it's a lot. Pretty, pretty pictures though. You reckon I've got ADD? I did, [[01:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=4629.0599999999995s)]
*  I was like, they look like streamers. That's what I thought when I looked at that. Yeah, because I just, [[01:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=4637.219999999999s)]
*  I'd say, what have I taken antidepressants? I got off like three months ago and then I just got back [[01:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=4640.82s)]
*  on like two days ago. I just couldn't take it anymore. I was on antidepressants coming off though. [[01:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=4644.9s)]
*  Actually my last standup show, I talk a lot about that. That's no fucking joke coming off those. Did [[01:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=4652.099999999999s)]
*  you find it really hard? Yeah, I found it hard. I found the harder part for me is realizing that I [[01:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=4657.299999999999s)]
*  have to go back on right now because I think I didn't want to have to be back on and traveling [[01:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=4662.82s)]
*  in Australia has been, it's just been tough. It's been tough to like, I had a good pattern of like [[01:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=4669.46s)]
*  fitness and stuff at home and I've still been doing well, but just not as organized. Your sleep [[01:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=4674.82s)]
*  patterns get off. So it put me in a like a real, I got into like, I got real angry and then I got [[01:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=4679.94s)]
*  like in a real tough spot and I just didn't know what else to do. So I was like, I think I just [[01:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=4687.54s)]
*  have to get back on them. So I think part of me was really bummed out that I had to. Yeah, [[01:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=4692.74s)]
*  yeah. I understand that. I remember when I had to go, I was on them, then I went off and went back [[01:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=4698.5s)]
*  on them and I thought the same thing. I was like, I don't want to be trapped on it. I felt trapped [[01:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=4704.66s)]
*  on antidepressants. It takes so long to come off them. Like coming off them, like take six weeks [[01:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=4710.66s)]
*  and have to wean yourself off. I was like, I don't want to have to do that again. Well, I got on them [[01:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=4716.58s)]
*  like 20 years ago. So I'm like, have I just, and the tough part is I don't have a lot of feelings. [[01:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=4722.18s)]
*  I have feelings, but it's hard to know what they are because the antidepressants kind of just make [[01:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=4727.700000000001s)]
*  everything feel the same. And then a lot of times some feelings I don't process. So I get in this [[01:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=4731.700000000001s)]
*  tough spot where I'll get off the antidepressants so I can have some feelings. But then sometimes if [[01:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=4737.22s)]
*  I'm not careful, there's some pitfalls and that can get pretty deep. And so it's just tough [[01:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=4743.14s)]
*  because it's like, well, I want to get married or something one day. And so I start thinking, [[01:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=4748.74s)]
*  well, I don't even know how I feel about people sometimes. Like if I'm dating, it's hard for me [[01:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=4756.82s)]
*  to even know because it's just hard for me to access my feelings. Yeah. They're numbing up. [[01:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=4760.98s)]
*  They're blunting. They blunt. Yeah. Everything kind of feels the same. It's like, oh man, [[01:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=4765.78s)]
*  I just saw that dog get hit by a bus or do I like Sharon? Yeah, exactly. It's the same feeling. [[01:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=4769.54s)]
*  You're trying. So I was like, I have to get off of these or I'm just going to be stuck in this [[01:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=4777.38s)]
*  cycle of not knowing how I feel about someone, you know? Yeah. But then it's just gotten too [[01:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=4782.34s)]
*  steep recently. So I'm going to get back on. I am back on now and then maybe I'll get off and [[01:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=4788.66s)]
*  never get back home. See, when I'm touring, I'm in the best routine. Isn't that weird? Wow. [[01:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=4792.74s)]
*  When I'm at home, I'm so fucking scattered with the kids and life and just to, and I think because [[01:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=4799.38s)]
*  I probably have my husband there as well, I'm like, help. And is a husband helpful or is a [[01:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=4806.34s)]

*  any of those sorts of things? I think the next time I come, I'm going to come back one more time. [[01:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=5854.42s)]
*  And make it a thing. Yeah. Just one more time before you die. Well, I don't know. I mean, [[01:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=5857.9400000000005s)]

*  Right. But I think a lot of people romanticize stuff like that, you know? You have nothing wrong [[01:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=5867.54s)]
*  with that. Yeah, no, it'd be nice, but you never know. But, um, but I think, uh, the first time [[01:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=5871.620000000001s)]

*  too hard on me. It's too much. That's what my last tour I did that it's way too hard. And so this time [[01:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=5881.06s)]
*  we slowed it down and it's been awesome. Got to be at the Gold Coast and see different places and [[01:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=5885.86s)]
*  spend a little bit more time in different cities. But then it also gets kind of long, you know, [[01:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=5894.0199999999995s)]

*  can kind of live and enjoy work. But like I was saying, I can't with fucking kids and living so [[01:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAqfZsm9OUY&t=5909.78s)]
