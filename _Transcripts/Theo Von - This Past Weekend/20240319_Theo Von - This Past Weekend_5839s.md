*  up. Oh yeah. That's some good shit. What'd you use this for? What'd you usually use this for? [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=120.78s)]
*  Fuck, I spray this shit under the hood if it gets tight under there, bro. Get that air [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=124.86s)]
*  filter, you know what I'm saying? Yeah, that's what it feels like. Like a WD-40 oil. It's like [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=130.1s)]
*  really oily. Remember when that AC belt under the car? Yeah, right. That shit. We rollin' [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=136.94s)]
*  Z? Yeah. All right. Okay. Yeah, nah, that's funny. Yeah, man. I like a little bit of lotion too. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=143.7s)]
*  And y'all use, what is the average? Amount? Black person probably use about, at least maybe about [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=150.1s)]
*  a thousand bottles of lotion a year. Not to expose us, but I'm just saying like this typical for a [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=159.54s)]
*  black family. It has probably a family. A family unit probably go through like a thousand a year. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=165.74s)]
*  Oh my God. So y'all- Depending on if it's Vaseline, probably cut that in half. Because Vaseline is [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=169.98s)]
*  more full. Yeah, it's more oily. It's more, it can get the job done for a couple days. But yeah, [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=176.14s)]
*  for a typical black family, we'll probably run through about a thousand. And some brothers, [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=181.85999999999999s)]
*  you gotta probably spray some WD-40 on them. You know what I'm saying? I've seen some guys that- [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=185.98s)]
*  You and this brother word. It's crazy. All right, I get it. Yeah. What brothers you know that use [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=189.73999999999998s)]
*  the oily stuff? What brothers have you run into? Okay, that's the oily lotion. That's like- Oh, [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=197.42s)]
*  I've seen a brother that maybe been in the wind or something a little bit and he, you know, [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=202.86s)]
*  ducks around a building and he'll just- You know, that dude, he'll work as a door hinge for the next [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=207.18s)]
*  year if he needs to, you know? But I've seen, you know, sometimes people need more. I notice I need [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=214.7s)]
*  some. When do you know? Because I feel like white people, they don't use anything on their lips. So [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=220.22s)]
*  their lips start to bleed, crack up and you know, what is that? I know, because we, you know, [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=226.46s)]
*  I kind of wanted to come here and ask questions like that. Because you know, a lot of people are [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=234.06s)]
*  scared to ask these type of questions. It's like, what is like the, you know, some of the white girls [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=237.5s)]
*  who go to like a college football game, a lot of their lips are bleeding cracks. Yeah. Yeah, [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=241.5s)]
*  you know, what is that? Yeah. Well, I think one of the good things about being black or [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=245.5s)]
*  um, off black, I don't know what some of the varieties are now, but I think one of the values [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=251.42s)]
*  in it is that you get early signs of dry skin. Like we don't find out till the last- Till it [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=256.86s)]
*  starts bleeding. Yeah, we find out. You're damn near like- We find out the last minute, bro. You [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=263.9s)]

*  like to stare at you and shit. You know, they're wide awake. They pay attention to every small [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=872.54s)]
*  detail. You can lift your finger and they're like, you know, it's like a paranoid thing for them. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=876.46s)]

*  So you've eaten a stranger's ass through a screen door? I have not, brother. That's pretty much what you just saw me. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=900.38s)]
*  I have not done it. You're over it. And you haven't done it in two years. I get it. I'm just saying. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=906.62s)]
*  Oh, it's been two years. I get it. But listen, you know, at least it was through a screen door [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=911.74s)]
*  because you needed some type of protection. I get it. But, you know, so the next day- That's that prison condom, [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=915.98s)]
*  baby. That screen door, baby. What is that mess? What is that metal mess? I think. Look up the material for what a screen door is. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=920.94s)]
*  But yeah, man, she's- Oh, blood. Yeah, because sometimes you see, well, you know, some people, [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=930.78s)]
*  you know, they used to have fiberglass in the living room. Yeah, yeah. That probably is good. That's strong enough to protect any STDs. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=936.3000000000001s)]
*  Oh, for sure, boy. I'll say this. They used to have a thing, you know, a long time ago, and this is unfortunate, [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=944.0600000000001s)]
*  but they- because some people, they have, their eyes are really, you know, some people have like an anti-belly button. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=952.5400000000001s)]
*  Some people have Audi. Some people got like Audi eyes, you know? Yeah. My aunt, my aunt kind of, well, not like that. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=960.3s)]
*  Not that bad, but my aunt kind of has eyes like that. And this is, I think some of this is in the black community. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=966.62s)]
*  Yeah. No, I don't think this is in the black community. You don't think so? No, I think that's just one black guy that has eyes like that. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=971.5799999999999s)]
*  Okay. Yeah, that's the one brother. I don't think there's any- okay, two. There's two. Okay, now this guy- There's a fat one and a skinny one. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=978.3s)]
*  But it seems like he's- Or maybe he just put on weight. That might be the same guy, though. That might be the same brother. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=984.9399999999999s)]
*  Well, they used to have, you know, a long time ago, and this is unfortunate, but they had a long time ago- [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=990.8599999999999s)]
*  Kids, this is what cocaine does to you. Sorry. Go ahead. Go ahead. Hold on. Yeah, this is cocaine. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=996.14s)]
*  Now we just googling shit. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=1001.5s)]
*  Now we just down. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=1006.14s)]
*  But they used to have, a long time ago, black folks were not allowed in movie theaters a long time ago. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=1009.9s)]
*  Yeah, no, I know. And they had, which is unfortunate, and it's wrong, and we know that, but [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=1014.62s)]
*  when they were first allowed in, they had to sit in the front row. And so I think you still have- [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=1020.54s)]
*  And y'all better not pull up no fucking picture of that. No, I'm just saying no. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=1027.98s)]
*  No. Yeah, keep these guys. But, because if you ever sat in the front row- Yeah, you gotta look up like that. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=1032.94s)]
*  So I think you still have like the grandchildren of some of those front row brothers, you know? [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=1040.46s)]
*  Yeah. You know what I'm saying, kinda? Yeah. I get that though. That actually makes a lot of sense. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=1044.38s)]
*  When you think about it, when you put it like that. Oh yeah. Well, because a lot of things we don't [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=1051.9s)]
*  realize are hereditary or genetic. Because I've sat in the front and I fucking, for the next two days, [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=1055.98s)]
*  I fucking can't, you know, I don't even need my rear view mirrors. I'm like, I get it all. I do it all. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=1061.42s)]

*  Oh, yeah. That was the most- That's the joy in it because black people are the funniest race [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=1219.18s)]
*  in America. At least I think. I don't know. Yeah. I think naturally, not talking about [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=1224.7s)]
*  like real talent or the amount of people we have. I think actually that the funniest race of all [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=1231.82s)]
*  people, like all of us somehow, some way are going to find funny in anything. Well, I think [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=1238.06s)]
*  also because black people have been through the most shit and when you go through shit- [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=1244.1399999999999s)]
*  It makes you have to adapt. Especially if you're sitting with your friends and y'all don't have, [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=1247.5s)]
*  say, like I remember growing up, a lot of times people didn't have air conditioners, [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=1252.78s)]
*  so we'd always be outside. So then you're joking with your friends. You're forced to. You're cutting [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=1257.26s)]
*  up. Yeah. You're not enjoying some creature comfort or doing something fancy. And that's really the [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=1261.26s)]
*  best shit, I think. What's creature comfort? A creature comfort is like if somebody has a [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=1266.46s)]
*  spa in there or like a, what is it? Like a- Fuck, I don't know what it is, man. It's like a [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=1272.46s)]
*  ottoman or something. Material comforts that contribute to physical ease and well-being, [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=1283.26s)]
*  such as good food and accommodations. Oh, man. Yeah. If somebody has fancy stuff- [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=1288.3s)]
*  Makes sense. Then you're more- Then you're going to be- Then you're going to enjoy that. [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=1291.9s)]
*  Instead of spending time with your friends. But yeah, I agree, man. Black people will make [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=1295.42s)]
*  the most funny shit. Yeah, yeah. It's just a natural thing for us, man. It's too much. [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=1298.7s)]
*  What have you been seeing? Do you see a lot of this Cat Williams stuff, man? [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=1304.78s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. That's been crazy. Have you spoken to him since all of this? [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=1308.0600000000002s)]
*  Nah, I actually seen him. I seen him at a game at one point, but I didn't- We didn't get a chance [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=1311.18s)]
*  to really connect. Yeah. Like he's one of those guys you can't tell. You can't really feel his [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=1316.8600000000001s)]
*  temperature. You don't know what the fuck he got going on in his brain. At first he was mugging me, [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=1321.8999999999999s)]
*  and then when I finally got around to going and talking to him, he was just like, he's like, [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=1328.54s)]
*  what's up, man? I'm like, never know. Wow. That guy's like, yeah, he's a walking bipolar disorder. [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=1332.7s)]
*  Yeah, he's interesting. Yeah, he's an interesting guy. But he's very talented. He's very funny. [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=1341.58s)]
*  Oh, wonderful. Very, very interesting guy. He'd be like, how you got 30 pairs of swimming trunks? [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=1346.3799999999999s)]
*  But you ain't never been in the water, Joe Rogan. You need to get Cat Williams on here. [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=1351.74s)]
*  Oh, I would love for him. Yeah, yeah, yeah. He definitely knows about you. [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=1356.94s)]
*  I got a statue of him at home. Really? Yeah, I got a Christmas statue. It's like a Christmas [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=1360.6200000000001s)]
*  Cat Williams that I have in my home. I bought it at Michael's a few years ago. [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=1366.14s)]
*  Why would you? What even inspired that? What is the reason? [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=1370.46s)]
*  I saw it. They had two left in there, and they was on- [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=1373.26s)]
*  On sale. Yeah. [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=1376.7s)]
*  I didn't think they should have been. Yeah, you bought both of them. [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=1380.06s)]
*  I got one. There it is. What the fuck, bro? You don't even lie about shit. You just be doing it. [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=1383.74s)]
*  I don't even think that was Cat Williams. That was just a black- [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=1389.6599999999999s)]
*  Fuck it ain't, baby. [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=1391.5s)]
*  Bro, that was a black fucking, what do you call this shit? [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=1392.6999999999998s)]
*  Cat Williams. That's what you call it. That's a black nutcracker. [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=1396.4599999999998s)]
*  That's a damn Cat Williams right there. Bro, you ain't telling me- [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=1400.4599999999998s)]
*  Bro, that's a black nutcracker. That's- [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=1404.54s)]
*  You ain't telling me that ain't a fucking Cat Williams, bro. [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=1406.8600000000001s)]
*  That's not Cat Williams. [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=1410.0600000000002s)]
*  Right, and you- I'm taking- [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=1412.0600000000002s)]
*  It's a black nutcracker. [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=1413.42s)]
*  I'm taking that bitch back. [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=1415.1000000000001s)]
*  Somehow, someway, that's fucking racist. That's not Cat Williams. [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=1416.14s)]
*  That ain't racist, bro. [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=1419.26s)]
*  Black nutcracker, bro. [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=1421.18s)]
*  I'm supporting the culture. How many people got a fucking black Cat Williams in their house for Christmas? [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=1422.7s)]
*  That's not a fucking Cat Williams. It's obviously a nutcracker. It was about Christmas. [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=1427.98s)]
*  Zoom in on his face a little bit. [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=1431.98s)]
*  Bro. [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=1434.14s)]
*  Now that you say it, I kind of see it. [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=1435.9s)]
*  I'm just saying that is. If that ain't him, then they should have said- the man said it was him. [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=1438.38s)]
*  The man at Michael's? [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=1444.5400000000002s)]
*  I bought that bitch at Michael's down there in Daphne, Alabama, baby. I got that bitch. [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=1445.74s)]
*  Two left, and shout out whoever got that last one. [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=1450.46s)]
*  And I'll sell it for 4,000 now, baby. [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=1454.94s)]
*  Tell them what it is. [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=1457.66s)]
*  That thing's going up. [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=1458.8600000000001s)]
*  With Cat Williams. [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=1459.66s)]
*  Because I remember I even tagged him in my story, and he shared it. [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=1460.78s)]
*  Swear. [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=1463.26s)]
*  Oh yeah, okay. Well, it's confirmed then. I didn't know that he had a Christmas line going. [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=1464.46s)]
*  Yeah, it's unbelievable. But I would love to see more Cat Williams stuff like that. [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=1468.94s)]
*  Just selling shit for Christmas. [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=1475.58s)]
*  Well, he's just one of a kind. [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=1477.18s)]
*  I feel like he doesn't sell any merch or any- not that I can remember. He should have did a whole [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=1480.3s)]
*  pimp line. If you think about it, he should have done a real fucking whole rollout of shit. [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=1486.3s)]
*  Because his whole shit was him being a pimp for 20 years of work for real. [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=1493.26s)]
*  The pimp chronicles him. [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=1498.22s)]
*  He would have made a shitload of money. But I'm sure he made a shitload of money off of touring. [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=1498.94s)]
*  Yeah, he's a unique person. He seems like he likes to do things his own way. [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=1503.34s)]
*  Would you think that that's a fair assessment of him? [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=1508.3s)]
*  I agree. I agree. 100%. Because he's not even into going to- like, yo, you won't see him at a fucking [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=1509.82s)]
*  GQ party. Or red carpet. I had never seen Cat Williams at a red carpet. [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=1516.1399999999999s)]
*  Oh, I saw him one time. I saw him on a bicycle go by the front of the Comedy Store. [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=1520.3799999999999s)]
*  It was one of those bicycles where the wheels are all lit up. [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=1526.3s)]
*  He wasn't even going in there. He was just going past it. [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=1528.46s)]
*  Just driving past on the front with some buddies. And just like this. [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=1530.3799999999999s)]
*  And I was like, is that Cat- and everybody at the same time was like, [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=1535.5s)]
*  holy shit, that's Cat fucking Williams, bro. [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=1538.46s)]
*  On a regular Wednesday night. [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=1541.82s)]
*  That's weird. It's not even- [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=1544.3799999999999s)]
*  Cruising by the- standing up on the wheels. [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=1546.3s)]
*  That's fucking weird. [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=1548.4599999999998s)]
*  Cat Williams, bitch. Merry Christmas. That's who he was. [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=1549.5s)]
*  It's weird. I mean, that's how- [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=1553.6599999999999s)]
*  Oh, yeah. I thought it was exceptional, man. You know? [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=1555.02s)]
*  How you got four McNuggets, but you only ordered a number one, Joe Rogan. [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=1559.1s)]
*  Tell me that. We all know that's a McDouble. [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=1564.2199999999998s)]
*  Can you play that clip? I don't even know what you're talking about right now. [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=1566.3s)]
*  Play that clip, man. I don't think there is one. [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=1570.38s)]
*  Where did you get that? [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=1572.7s)]
*  He just- everything he lays out is like- [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=1573.5800000000002s)]
*  You made that up though? [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=1575.9s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=1577.02s)]
*  Okay. [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=1577.5800000000002s)]
*  Oh yeah. Just everything he lays out is like- [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=1578.14s)]
*  It just has- it's got like a pentameter to it. It's got like a beat. It's like his own [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=1582.94s)]
*  rhythm that he makes, man. [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=1589.98s)]

*  What have you heard that you know? [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=1838.06s)]
*  I mean, people always would say that he might be a little rambunctious. [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=1841.1000000000001s)]
*  That's the kind of stuff I would hear. [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=1849.26s)]
*  Rambunctious is actually a great word to describe it. [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=1850.62s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=1853.26s)]

*  But I think you also hear that about anybody that's got a lot of money. [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=1863.02s)]
*  A lot of power. [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=1866.6999999999998s)]
*  And a lot of power. [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=1867.34s)]
*  Yes. [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=1868.4599999999998s)]
*  The second somebody's got a lot of power, they start saying they gay. [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=1869.02s)]
*  Oh, that's one of them power gays and money gays. [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=1872.54s)]
*  You know? [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=1876.2199999999998s)]
*  I don't know anybody that has said that. [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=1877.02s)]
*  Somebody has said that's one of those power gays. [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=1879.74s)]
*  That's one of those. [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=1881.66s)]
*  And certainly in, I get, it could just be white culture. [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=1882.3s)]
*  You hear a lot of somebody gets a lot of money. [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=1887.18s)]
*  No, it's true though. [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=1889.1s)]
*  I've never, I just never ever heard anybody say it's one of those power gays. [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=1889.9s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=1893.9s)]
*  The money gays and power gays. [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=1894.3s)]
*  Because they have, they've done everything. [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=1897.26s)]
*  They start just being gay because they can afford it. [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=1899.02s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=1902.22s)]
*  You know, cause when you're poor. [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=1902.86s)]
*  That actually makes a lot of sense when you think about it. [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=1903.82s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=1906.3s)]
*  Because you've experienced everything. [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=1906.86s)]
*  You're saying they got bored of it. [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=1908.62s)]

*  Yeah. [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=1913.58s)]
*  Women and anything. [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=1913.8999999999999s)]
*  They're like, fuck it. [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=1915.58s)]

*  Yeah. [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=1918.62s)]
*  Okay. [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=1919.26s)]
*  Like I can afford, cause if you don't have any money and you're gay, [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=1919.82s)]
*  then you can't afford to tell people to be quiet about it. [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=1923.26s)]
*  Cause the second you hook up with somebody, [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=1925.5s)]
*  they're going to run across the street and you start yelling Leonard's gay. [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=1927.34s)]
*  You know? [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=1930.4599999999998s)]
*  But if you got money, then you can be like, shh, don't tell them. [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=1931.34s)]
*  And then they'll run across the street and they'll be like, [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=1936.9399999999998s)]
*  I ain't telling you who gay, but it might be Leonard. [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=1939.1s)]
*  You know? [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=1942.54s)]
*  It's different. [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=1943.4199999999998s)]
*  You never know, man. [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=1945.1799999999998s)]
*  That's what I'm saying. [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=1946.9399999999998s)]
*  Now they got the memes. [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=1947.1799999999998s)]
*  But here's one thing I do notice in black culture, you guys can start, [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=1948.3s)]
*  they can start ripping on people in podcasts about like, [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=1951.34s)]
*  people will start commenting. [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=1954.78s)]
*  Oh, he's gay. [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=1955.82s)]
*  This is why I know. [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=1956.4599999999998s)]
*  But in white culture, if we did that, bro, people would be like, [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=1958.3s)]
*  you can't say that he needs to be able to come out the car. [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=1962.78s)]
*  That's why I say it's different in different cultures. [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=1965.02s)]
*  You really can't assess like, yeah, I'm just trying to find the right words [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=1966.86s)]
*  to say to not get canceled. [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=1972.06s)]

*  Assessment and an organization. [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=1974.3799999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=1978.22s)]
*  But yeah, I think like, yeah, maybe I shouldn't say anything either then. [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=1979.18s)]
*  But they got all those memes now, you know? [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=1984.94s)]

*  Yeah, what do you think about this? [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=2143.44s)]
*  Sexy Red responded to Aiden Ross after he said they had sex together. [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=2144.56s)]
*  Do you think that's just? [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=2148.16s)]
*  I think it's bullshit. [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=2150.3199999999997s)]
*  I think it's bullshit. [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=2151.2s)]
*  I think it's bullshit. [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=2151.9199999999996s)]
*  I'm not sure. [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=2153.3599999999997s)]
*  And if she did, I can't believe it, man. [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=2154.16s)]
*  I'm not going to lie because I felt like she just went along with it. [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=2158.3199999999997s)]
*  She's a funny person on Twitter. [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=2161.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=2163.9199999999996s)]
*  All her tweets are crazy. [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=2164.48s)]
*  If you pull up any of sexy red's tweets, let's read some of her tweets. [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=2165.84s)]

*  All her tweets on Twitter are fucking insane. [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=2170.0s)]
*  Sexy Red is a vibe, though. [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=2174.08s)]
*  Huh? [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=2175.6s)]

*  Yeah. [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=2180.32s)]
*  I know you're not really into black girls, but that's one that you should take down for sure. [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=2181.2s)]
*  If there's any black girl, it'd probably be like, sexy Red. [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=2187.6s)]
*  Ooh, baby, I've been working hard. [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=2191.12s)]

*  My coochie stank, period. [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=2193.6s)]
*  And then retweeted herself, this motherfucker stank right now. [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=2196.0s)]
*  Thank the Lord. [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=2199.12s)]
*  Thank the Lord. [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=2200.0s)]
*  That's like you. [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=2200.96s)]
*  That's why I said she'd be praying for you. [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=2201.6s)]
*  Praise God. [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=2202.64s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=2203.52s)]

*  Yeah. [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=2204.48s)]
*  Oh, man, I wanted to take her to a UFC fight, but she got pregnant. [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=2205.36s)]
*  You think she would fuck with UFC, though? [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=2211.8399999999997s)]
*  You think she got pregnant just to get out of the fight? [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=2213.68s)]
*  No. [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=2215.68s)]
*  What do you mean, to go on a UFC fight with you? [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=2218.7999999999997s)]
*  Or, yeah, to like, no. [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=2220.56s)]
*  Did you ask her, or you were saying? [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=2222.0s)]
*  Yeah, I said I would like to take her, and she said she would go. [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=2223.92s)]
*  And then she's like, I'm pregnant. [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=2227.6s)]
*  I don't think she would get pregnant to get out of a date. [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=2230.56s)]
*  That's pretty, that's nine months of. [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=2233.92s)]
*  Unless she really didn't want to go on it, bro. [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=2238.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=2240.96s)]
*  I mean, but still, I mean, that's pretty absurd, man. [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=2241.68s)]
*  That's not really. [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=2244.56s)]
*  That's heartbreaking. [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=2245.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=2246.56s)]
*  Oh, yeah, she's cute, huh? [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=2247.28s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=2248.96s)]
*  Yeah, I like this. [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=2250.24s)]
*  That's what I said. [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=2250.72s)]
*  I feel like that would be your type if you dated black girls. [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=2251.3599999999997s)]
*  I'm willing to date a nice black girl. [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=2256.3999999999996s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=2258.3999999999996s)]
*  What is, I mean. [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=2259.52s)]
*  A black girl that's nice? [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=2261.52s)]
*  Okay. [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=2262.72s)]
*  I mean, what is your description of nice? [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=2263.7599999999998s)]
*  Oh, yeah, it could be anybody. [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=2265.6s)]
*  I think somebody that. [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=2267.2s)]
*  I don't think they smoke cigarettes. [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=2270.8799999999997s)]
*  So that's not it. [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=2273.68s)]
*  It's more of like vape shit now. [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=2275.04s)]
*  I don't think. [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=2276.7999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, maybe. [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=2277.2s)]
*  I think it might be okay if she vapes. [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=2278.3199999999997s)]
*  As long as she's not vaping at night or whatever. [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=2279.92s)]
*  But yeah, I think so. [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=2282.32s)]
*  I saw a girl at the airport the other day that was really. [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=2284.4s)]

*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=2305.04s)]
*  With the bag. [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=2307.6800000000003s)]
*  She would feel probably. [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=2308.64s)]
*  I'll be rolling over every Samsonite in that bitch to get back to my girl. [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=2310.72s)]
*  What does she look like? [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=2314.72s)]
*  Like describe. [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=2315.6s)]

*  Had some booty on her, bro. [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=2318.72s)]
*  Yeah, I knew that. [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=2321.2s)]
*  Some of the titty went into the booty. [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=2323.36s)]
*  I was like, damn, this is a whole. [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=2324.96s)]
*  I'm trying to imagine that. [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=2327.36s)]
*  It was just. [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=2328.64s)]
*  Like Coke bottle shape. [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=2332.48s)]
*  I mean, she looked like the letter S, bro. [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=2334.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=2336.7999999999997s)]
*  And she was really pretty eyes. [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=2337.78s)]
*  Nice, soft spoken. [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=2341.86s)]
*  Looked at me twice. [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=2346.34s)]
*  One time I hung around for a long time for the second look. [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=2349.2200000000003s)]
*  But still. [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=2352.1800000000003s)]
*  It's getting weird at that point. [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=2352.82s)]
*  It still counts. [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=2354.1000000000004s)]
*  But yeah, it was a little weird. [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=2354.9s)]
*  And I waved and I walked off, bro. [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=2356.42s)]
*  And the wave was what fucking fucked me up. [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=2358.1800000000003s)]
*  What type of fucking guy waves? [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=2361.54s)]
*  See, that's going to turn black women off. [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=2364.5s)]

*  One of our white brothers in the community. [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=2373.14s)]
*  I think more black women want you to be. [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=2375.54s)]
*  You got to be more assertive. [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=2378.02s)]
*  Not too much because you know how y'all get. [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=2379.86s)]

*  I'm surprised. [[00:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=3566.98s)]
*  Yeah, good luck, buddy. [[00:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=3573.1s)]

*  You know, we hope to free that guy, though. [[00:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=3578.22s)]
*  Somebody got to agree. [[00:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=3581.18s)]
*  With the budget that we got for him, yeah. [[00:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=3581.9s)]
*  Amen. [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=3583.74s)]
*  And what about the show? [[00:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=3584.7799999999997s)]
*  How does it evolve? [[00:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=3586.14s)]
*  What can we look forward to seeing on the show, man? [[00:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=3587.34s)]
*  Oh, man, it evolves. [[00:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=3589.34s)]
*  Because I saw them battle rapping on the tennis courts. [[00:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=3591.42s)]
*  I saw them getting their emergency braces off. [[00:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=3593.98s)]
*  We brought real talent in to help these guys out, too. [[00:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=3597.42s)]
*  Really? [[00:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=3599.82s)]
*  Chris Brown, Snoop Dogg. [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=3600.3s)]
*  We had a vocal coach that came in and helped them. [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=3603.5s)]
*  Really? [[01:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=3606.46s)]
*  Yeah, man. [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=3607.02s)]
*  All this stuff. [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=3608.0600000000004s)]
*  We really, we really, this is about music going. [[01:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=3609.9s)]
*  Keep it about music. [[01:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=3613.34s)]
*  And majority of it is about signing them to deals they can't get out of. [[01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=3615.6600000000003s)]
*  So it's like a snooze you lose situation. [[01:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=3619.58s)]
*  And you learn from your mistakes. [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=3622.38s)]
*  So it's almost teaching them through hard learning. [[01:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=3624.38s)]
*  They're signed us for the rest of their life and not receiving anything from it. [[01:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=3627.42s)]
*  So it's kind of like they're going to eventually learn that that was a bad situation. [[01:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=3630.54s)]
*  But it's good teaching. [[01:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=3636.46s)]
*  Good teaching comes from like hard lessons. [[01:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=3637.2599999999998s)]
*  Yeah, you know. [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=3639.34s)]

*  Yeah, man. [[01:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=3649.5s)]
*  Yeah, you got to learn the dirty ends and outs of Hollywood, baby. [[01:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=3650.06s)]
*  You got to make enough money to be gay, baby. [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=3653.42s)]
*  Okay, no, no, we, no, we actually, we actually did just to clear that up. [[01:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=3655.82s)]
*  We didn't, we did not do anything to them. [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=3660.2200000000003s)]
*  And no, I'm not saying y'all did anything with them, but I'm saying, [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=3662.6200000000003s)]
*  because look, I could see what they're saying because I could see how some people get enough [[01:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=3665.5800000000004s)]
*  money where they're thinking I'm going to be, I could be gay if I want. [[01:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=3669.42s)]
*  No, actually we didn't. [[01:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=3673.1000000000004s)]
*  He's just the gay crip rapper. [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=3674.94s)]
*  We didn't do anything gay. [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=3676.3s)]
*  There's nothing gay on the show. [[01:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=3677.6600000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=3679.42s)]
*  Okay. [[01:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=3680.2200000000003s)]
*  There's nothing gay, nothing against them. [[01:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=3680.54s)]
*  I just, we didn't indulge in anything gay on the show. [[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=3682.78s)]
*  Did being gay help him in any instances? [[01:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=3687.34s)]
*  I do think being gay helped his career for sure because it helped him be seen and be heard more. [[01:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=3689.34s)]
*  That's a good point. [[01:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=3696.46s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[01:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=3697.1800000000003s)]
*  It helped him be seen and heard more because there's a lot of crip rappers. [[01:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=3697.9s)]
*  There's not too many openly gay crip rappers, right? [[01:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=3701.7400000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=3704.7000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, we, we, I had to pick him up, man. [[01:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=3705.7400000000002s)]
*  He was, he was hard to find. [[01:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=3707.9s)]
*  Was he? [[01:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=3709.82s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=3710.3s)]
*  We went, we went through a whole bunch of shit trying to reach out. [[01:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=3711.34s)]
*  The crips hide a lot of the probably, I wonder if they- [[01:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=3714.86s)]
*  Yeah, they might, they might've, I don't know. [[01:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=3718.06s)]
*  Do you wonder if they what? [[01:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=3720.54s)]
*  Hide the gay community or they, or they push it out forward, you know? [[01:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=3721.9s)]
*  That's a good question. [[01:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=3725.58s)]
*  I think gangs are evolving more. [[01:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=3726.54s)]
*  I did read something about eight months ago that gangs are involved, [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=3728.54s)]
*  evolving more to invite more LGBTQ friendly patrons. [[01:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=3732.06s)]
*  I actually don't think you read that at all. [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=3736.7s)]
*  Really? [[01:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=3738.46s)]
*  I don't think that it was a, was that out there? [[01:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=3738.94s)]
*  You might be right. [[01:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=3741.5s)]
*  Did you read that? [[01:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=3743.1s)]
*  I did read that, I think. [[01:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=3743.9s)]
*  You think? [[01:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=3745.34s)]
*  I'm not sure, but I think I could've. [[01:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=3746.46s)]
*  Look it up. [[01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=3749.34s)]
*  But I say this, bro. [[01:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=3751.58s)]

*  That's the craziest thing, bro. [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=3756.62s)]
*  Why do you keep revisiting this? [[01:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=3758.22s)]
*  Because everybody keeps talking about it, man. [[01:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=3760.7799999999997s)]
*  It's a gay witch hunt right now going on. [[01:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=3763.74s)]
*  How you gonna say you never seen a wiener, [[01:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=3766.06s)]
*  but you know the shape of a man's balls, Joe Rogan. [[01:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=3768.62s)]
*  That's what I'm talking about, bro. [[01:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=3772.7s)]
*  Cat is the Oracle. [[01:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=3774.2999999999997s)]
*  They need to rub on Cat's back and get three more fucking, [[01:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=3775.8999999999996s)]
*  three more prophecies ties out of him, bro. [[01:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=3780.46s)]
*  Cause he got the magic. [[01:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=3783.1s)]
*  You need to bring Cat on here, for real. [[01:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=3783.74s)]
*  I'd love to, man. [[01:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=3785.58s)]
*  I would love to. [[01:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=3787.3399999999997s)]
*  I think y'all would really, [[01:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=3788.38s)]
*  y'all might get into a battle rap on here. [[01:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=3789.7400000000002s)]
*  Yeah, it could be interesting. [[01:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=3792.1400000000003s)]
*  How does the show, can you give us any pointers about the show? [[01:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=3795.42s)]
*  Like what does it look like down the line? [[01:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=3797.7400000000002s)]
*  I can't give them too much cause you know, [[01:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=3800.1400000000003s)]
*  I kind of want everybody to continue to tune in [[01:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=3801.98s)]
*  and not really know what to expect, [[01:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=3804.54s)]
*  if you feel what I'm saying. [[01:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=3807.58s)]
*  Like it's honestly, every episode you couldn't even, [[01:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=3808.54s)]
*  you couldn't guess what's gonna happen next. [[01:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=3813.1800000000003s)]
*  And I think that's what is keeping the viewers so entertained. [[01:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=3814.94s)]
*  Cause they don't know what the fuck is to come [[01:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=3818.06s)]
*  of none of that shit. [[01:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=3820.7s)]
*  At any moment, like I didn't know that Crypt Mac [[01:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=3822.38s)]
*  was gonna go on there trying to check everybody, right? [[01:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=3825.74s)]

*  And I'm thinking he's, I said, yeah, talk to the kids, man. [[01:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=3836.7799999999997s)]
*  Talk to him. [[01:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=3839.58s)]
*  He was trying to give them the beat [[01:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=3841.02s)]
*  and beat the shit out of them. [[01:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=3843.42s)]
*  So, you know, neither here nor there, [[01:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=3844.7799999999997s)]
*  but we handled it. [[01:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=3847.82s)]
*  We handled it though. [[01:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=3848.86s)]
*  We didn't let them, we didn't let it get too out of hand. [[01:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=3849.6600000000003s)]
*  Yeah, y'all were on top of it a lot. [[01:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=3851.9s)]
*  It seemed like, make it sure. [[01:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=3853.6600000000003s)]
*  We had security everywhere. [[01:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=3854.94s)]

*  Everywhere, yeah. [[01:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=3856.46s)]
*  Well, I noticed even what's his name, Snitch, before the fight. [[01:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=3857.02s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[01:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=3860.6200000000003s)]
*  Ugliest rapper alive. [[01:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=3861.42s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=3862.86s)]
*  You gotta respect that, man. [[01:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=3863.26s)]
*  I respect a guy who snitches, but also will still go fight. [[01:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=3864.78s)]
*  Will still, yeah. [[01:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=3871.1000000000004s)]
*  But Snitch first. [[01:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=3872.78s)]

*  Let the Lord do as he pleases with it, right? [[01:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=4051.58s)]
*  If it gets to one of the sharks or a whale out there, that's what it is. [[01:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=4054.54s)]
*  But imagine it gets to China and some dude opens it up and he's like, yeah! [[01:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=4057.34s)]

*  Yeah, we wore Halloween masks and stuff like that. [[01:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=4825.58s)]
*  Sometimes we put a brown paper bag over our head and painted up and cut eyes and all that in. [[01:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=4829.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=4835.259999999999s)]
*  Why did you guys do that, though? [[01:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=4835.82s)]
*  What is the reason? [[01:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=4837.66s)]
*  Because we were so poor and couldn't afford nothing else. [[01:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=4838.62s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=4841.58s)]
*  And would y'all go trick or treating or what? [[01:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=4843.339999999999s)]
*  Trick or treating and get us a little candy and all that. [[01:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=4846.14s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=4849.9800000000005s)]

*  Yeah. [[01:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=4863.5s)]
*  Why? [[01:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=4864.22s)]
*  Because they was always there for me. [[01:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=4866.06s)]
*  And I was there for them. [[01:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=4869.02s)]
*  I told you, I said a brother always... [[01:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=4870.46s)]
*  He ain't never going to expire. [[01:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=4871.82s)]

*  I used to get in a fight and go over here and be wanting to fight. [[01:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=4876.22s)]
*  He was black, you know, but he'll come over there, he'll tell the other black boy, [[01:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=4880.14s)]
*  you ain't messing with him now. [[01:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=4884.22s)]

*  Yeah. [[01:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=4885.820000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=4886.22s)]
*  He said, if you go fight him, I'm going to whoop you. [[01:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=4886.700000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLvwQX-Aos&t=4889.26s)]
