*  Thanks, man. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=84.9s)]
*  Yeah, I feel pretty good. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=108.26s)]
*  I got some vitamin D today. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=108.98s)]
*  I went for a run, you know, I think I was feeling like overwhelmed. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=110.46000000000001s)]
*  So sometimes when I feel like even if I feel if I feel anything too much, it's [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=114.58s)]
*  like I feel like if I do something in motion, it helps me, you know, and getting [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=120.02s)]
*  some vitamin D helps me to move muscle, change of thought. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=125.42s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=129.18s)]
*  But I had the same experience yesterday where I, you know, they had me scheduled [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=130.26s)]
*  like back to back all day and I said, I just need to get out. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=134.26s)]
*  I just canceled one of my appointments and I went out and this is on for an hour. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=137.42s)]
*  And I just, it was transformative. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=143.66000000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=146.42000000000002s)]
*  It's interesting. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=146.66000000000003s)]
*  I think we forget that we're supposed to be plants like that, you know, or that [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=147.26000000000002s)]
*  we're part because our humans part plants too, do you think? [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=151.62s)]
*  No, no. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=154.70000000000002s)]
*  Although the microbiome has a lot of plants and it's, I guess it's part of our [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=156.5s)]
*  body and it's a plant, I suppose. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=162.62s)]
*  But, um, we are definitely, uh, we're a zoonotic species, rather than a plant [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=164.70000000000002s)]
*  species. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=172.7s)]
*  Dang. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=173.26s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=174.78s)]
*  Sometimes I guess I feel like a plant. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=174.98s)]
*  Um, or I don't know if I sit by a window, I feel good, you know, if somebody comes [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=176.57999999999998s)]
*  up and smells me, if I smell good, I feel good, I guess. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=180.66s)]
*  So that's kind of like a flower. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=183.82s)]
*  Maybe. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=184.94s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=185.17999999999998s)]
*  Maybe I'm losing my mind. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=185.89999999999998s)]
*  Um, good to see you, man. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=187.1s)]
*  You too. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=188.73999999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=189.38s)]
*  You look great. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=189.66s)]
*  You did. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=191.06s)]
*  You look amazing. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=191.82s)]
*  Well, I feel pretty good, man. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=193.22s)]
*  I'm just, uh, I've been staying pretty busy. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=194.5s)]
*  I'm trying to think of what's been going on. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=197.06s)]
*  Have you been in Nashville? [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=198.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=200.14s)]
*  I've been over there a decent amount, you know? [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=200.29999999999998s)]
*  Um, I couldn't believe how that is growing there. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=202.1s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=205.98s)]
*  And there's, there's like 20 grains above that city. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=206.26s)]
*  They must have all the grains from everywhere in the United States there. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=208.57999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, it's been, it's been busy. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=212.38s)]
*  I mean, even since I just moved there, like three years ago, it's like, I'll go down [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=213.62s)]
*  streets now and everything's, everything's changing. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=216.5s)]
*  It's really nice. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=219.26s)]
*  One of the things I like best there, I have the best neighbors there. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=219.85999999999999s)]
*  My neighbors are really nice. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=222.14s)]
*  Um, and it still has a really small, it has a small town vibe. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=223.9s)]
*  Like you couldn't cheat on your wife there. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=230.34s)]
*  That's what I tell people. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=231.54s)]
*  You could not do it. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=233.42s)]
*  I mean, you could, I think a lot of people have tried, but you could, it's just, [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=235.01999999999998s)]
*  there's too much, it still has like that, a little bit of that Southern [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=238.14s)]
*  gossip vibe, you know? [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=240.62s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=242.45999999999998s)]
*  Do you have like, you know, like a little house there? [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=243.1s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=246.66s)]
*  I got me a little house in a neighborhood. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=247.42s)]
*  It's pretty normal. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=248.94s)]
*  Nothing too fancy. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=249.85999999999999s)]
*  I mean, it's a nice home, but, um, it's nothing like, I don't have like a, uh, [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=251.26s)]
*  water slide or anything, you know, or anything like that, or like a, um, [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=256.62s)]
*  part of an ax. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=260.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=261.97999999999996s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=262.18s)]
*  Um, but it's been good, man. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=265.97999999999996s)]
*  It's been a nice change of pace. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=267.65999999999997s)]
*  I feel a little bit more connected to just like regular society. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=268.85999999999996s)]
*  Cause I think in LA it's like a, it's just a different universe out here than [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=272.82s)]
*  like regular cities or towns in America for sure. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=276.58s)]
*  Um, and there's so many people here, you know, I think people start to feel a [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=279.58s)]
*  little bit, I don't want to say expendable, but it's like some people, you [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=282.82s)]
*  know, you're, you're not going to see them ever again. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=286.06s)]
*  So there's like a different amount of, um, value sometimes to the interaction [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=287.9s)]
*  that you have to put into it, you know, like in a smaller community, you have [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=293.65999999999997s)]
*  to have, you have to create a level of probably more respect for people and [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=296.78s)]
*  stuff and like, um, whereas in a city you're just going to, does that make any sense? [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=300.17999999999995s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=306.78s)]
*  I remember who was, it was a writer for the New Yorker. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=307.06s)]
*  I'm trying to remember his name, but he's kind of a philosopher. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=310.7s)]
*  And he was talking about the, um, that there's a formula actually that, you [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=313.3s)]
*  know, people are rude and in big cities because the chance of them ever running [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=318.74s)]
*  into you again is, is more remote. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=324.70000000000005s)]
*  Whereas if you live in a small town, I've lived in Montgomery, Alabama, [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=326.82000000000005s)]
*  which is really a small town and, uh, Hainville, Alabama. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=331.82000000000005s)]
*  And then I lived in Deadwood, South Dakota, uh, you know, a couple of [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=335.54s)]
*  other small towns in my life and everybody's, you know, I've lived in [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=339.06s)]
*  nice and when you're driving down the road and your pickup truck, everybody [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=343.3s)]
*  who has you on the road waves their hand like that. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=348.54s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=351.62s)]
*  He was saying, uh, he was telling this story that, um, uh, that mother Teresa, [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=354.1s)]
*  when she came to New York, she tried to start one of her little, you know, con [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=360.86s)]
*  monasteries to take care of the poor in New York and that, um, they eventually [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=366.06s)]
*  ended up closing it because they didn't want to put an elevator in the place. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=370.98s)]
*  And they said, no, we'll just carry the sick people up the stairs ourselves. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=374.38s)]
*  I love that idea. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=379.42s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=380.34000000000003s)]
*  But in New York, the public health agencies wouldn't let them do it. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=380.58000000000004s)]
*  So they said, okay, we're leaving. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=384.5s)]
*  But she, at one point, Mayor Koch had a, uh, had a heart attack. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=386.62s)]
*  Mayor Koch. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=390.90000000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=391.58000000000004s)]
*  Okay. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=392.26s)]
*  Ed Koch was, uh, he was, uh, the mayor of New York for long, long term mayor. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=392.66s)]
*  And he had a heart attack and he nearly died. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=399.53999999999996s)]
*  And she went to visit him in his hospital bed and what she thought it was a great [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=402.29999999999995s)]
*  kindness because, you know, she's a Catholic and he's a Jewish mayor. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=409.29999999999995s)]
*  And it just was a, you know, it was kind of a spiritual act. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=414.18s)]
*  But when she was up there, she asked him, can you give me a parking place [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=417.17999999999995s)]
*  in front of my, uh, my building? [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=422.02s)]
*  And, uh, as a joke. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=426.14s)]
*  No, she wanted a parking place, but it kind of, well, of course you would give her [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=429.1s)]
*  a parking place if you got a very, she there is the mother Teresa. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=435.9s)]
*  That's hilarious. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=439.86s)]
*  So, uh, but she, you know, it's just the idea that she had an angle, you know, [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=441.02s)]
*  once you go to New York, you always got to have an angle. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=446.78s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=449.1s)]
*  And maybe it is, you're just like, and I always feel like LA is kind of like an air. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=450.14s)]
*  It always feels like the whole city feels like a little bit like an airport to me. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=453.65999999999997s)]
*  It's like, I feel like I never leave the airport here. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=456.98s)]
*  Like it, it just, the whole, it just, it feels like this thoroughfare of just [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=459.5s)]
*  people going in and out, you know? [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=463.3s)]
*  Um, I sometimes I started to feel like America starts to feel like that. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=466.3s)]
*  Sometimes I think it starts to feel to a lot of people, like, um, it almost [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=469.54s)]
*  feels like a shell company sometimes. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=475.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=478.14000000000004s)]
*  Or like, it feels like an LLC for like big bid. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=478.90000000000003s)]
*  It starts to sometimes feel like an LLC for like big business. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=482.38s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=485.26s)]
*  Does that make any sense? [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=485.66s)]
*  That makes a lot of sense. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=486.74s)]
*  I mean, I think that's what it's becoming. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=488.18s)]
*  And one of the things that like, I I'm talking about a lot now is this, um, [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=491.02s)]
*  you know, there is housing price. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=496.5s)]
*  So I housing prices, you said, yeah, you know what I was, um, I tried the [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=498.06s)]
*  Monsanto case in San Francisco with a big team of attorneys and we tried [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=503.53999999999996s)]
*  three cases in a row, so that we had about 20,000 cases and the way that, you [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=509.62s)]
*  know, this kind of, um, uh, multi state litigation. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=515.46s)]
*  And the case was that they were, it was poisonous, right? [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=520.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=522.82s)]
*  It was, it was causing non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=523.1s)]
*  Okay. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=525.34s)]
*  So we had enough science to prove that it could cause on it. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=525.98s)]
*  Did it could cause non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=529.9000000000001s)]
*  And then we had, we ended up having 50,000 people who had gotten on the [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=532.22s)]
*  Hodgkin's lymphoma and, but the way that you try the case, you try them one at a [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=538.0600000000001s)]
*  time until if you win three or four in a row, then the company says, and [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=542.78s)]
*  Monsanto says, okay, now we know what the value of the case. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=547.3s)]
*  So the first case we got 289 million. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=549.9s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=552.62s)]
*  I just saw this brought that up. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=552.8199999999999s)]
*  Wow. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=553.9399999999999s)]
*  The second case we got, um, [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=554.38s)]
*  and so that was one client and that was one, that was, uh, Dwayne Johnson. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=557.42s)]
*  Oh, uh, not the rock. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=562.22s)]
*  You're not talking about him. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=563.9s)]
*  Not the rock. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=564.62s)]
*  This was African-American school superintendent. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=565.4599999999999s)]
*  He, you know, his job was to spray the weeds on the property and keep the, [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=570.7s)]
*  mow the lawn and do that on a school, public school. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=577.1800000000001s)]
*  And he was in a backpack, um, uh, sprayer and it leaked all the time. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=581.38s)]
*  And he began getting lesions on his back and he called up Monsanto. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=587.5s)]
*  He called them three times and said, could this be from the, cause it [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=592.82s)]
*  says safe as ass for nothing. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=596.86s)]
*  Nothing could happen to you. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=598.46s)]
*  And it has pictures. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=600.82s)]
*  It had pictures on the label of people spraying their weeds, wearing like [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=601.98s)]
*  Bermuda shorts and Hawaiian shirt. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=607.14s)]
*  So it was implying that you don't have to take any protection with [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=609.02s)]
*  this stuff because it's so safe. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=612.0600000000001s)]
*  Oh, he thought he felt like it was coming from that, from that. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=614.38s)]
*  And it turned out to be non-oxygenal lymphoma. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=618.4200000000001s)]
*  It was pre-cancerous lesions and, but they would never return his phone [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=621.3000000000001s)]
*  call and they knew it and they just didn't want to, you know, so they, they, [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=625.38s)]
*  uh, they sandbagged him and he, um, and, and he was the sweetest guy when we got [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=630.26s)]
*  him on the sand and he was married to this beautiful Hispanic woman. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=637.6600000000001s)]
*  They had fallen in love the first time they saw each other at community college [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=642.0600000000001s)]
*  and they had this wonderful marriage and he couldn't sleep in the bed with her [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=645.6600000000001s)]
*  anymore because he had so many lesions on his body and, you know, he wouldn't [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=650.0600000000001s)]
*  go in the swimming pool cause he, you know, if anybody saw him in the pool, they [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=655.98s)]
*  would think they were going to get a disease. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=659.7s)]
*  So his life was, it was just so miserable. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=661.3000000000001s)]
*  And the jury loves them. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=663.58s)]
*  They gave him 289 million, 289 million. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=665.82s)]
*  And then the next one, I forgot, we, we got, I think we got around 300 million. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=669.38s)]
*  The second, the third one we asked for a bit was a couple who were both gardeners, [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=675.0600000000001s)]
*  home gardeners, and they brought their dog with them to home garden. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=680.6600000000001s)]
*  They had a Labrador retriever. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=683.9000000000001s)]
*  The Labrador died of non-oxygenal lymphoma. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=686.1s)]
*  He got it the same time they did. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=689.66s)]
*  The couple both got it the same time. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=691.3s)]
*  And the dog got it. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=692.7s)]
*  The dog died first. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=694.9s)]
*  And then, um, the, uh, you know, then they were, uh, they were really sick. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=696.22s)]
*  We asked the jury for a billion dollars and we had a big argument about it. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=703.34s)]
*  You know, what do you ask the jury? [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=706.74s)]
*  Cause you don't want to ask them for too much. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=707.78s)]
*  Cause then they think you're overreaching and they may punish you. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=709.46s)]
*  Okay. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=712.5s)]
*  Oh, the one guy who was arguing, doing the closing argument, a lawyer called [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=713.34s)]
*  Brent Wisner, very young lawyer, but really brilliant. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=717.9s)]
*  And he, uh, and we were all saying, you should ask them for 300 million. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=722.86s)]
*  That's what the other juries were paying us. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=727.62s)]
*  And he said, I'm going to ask them for a billion. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=730.34s)]
*  I feel like the jury, like, since they came back with 2.2 billion, [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=731.98s)]
*  we asked them for a billion. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=737.1s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=738.66s)]
*  And, uh, so they were pissed them on Santa. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=739.5s)]
*  They were so angry because we also showed that that's the lawyer right there. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=741.62s)]
*  I would just walk by Brent Wisner. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=747.1s)]
*  Wow. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=749.0600000000001s)]
*  Um, God, I got to pick up some on Santa on the way home. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=750.1s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=753.66s)]
*  You got to go to law school. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=754.02s)]
*  See, you know, one or the other, man. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=755.26s)]
*  I got it. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=757.02s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=757.34s)]
*  I got to get a case like this. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=758.14s)]
*  But anyway, I didn't mean to go off on this. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=759.78s)]
*  But what I was saying is when we were trying these cases, we were [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=762.1800000000001s)]
*  trying one after the other. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=766.5s)]
*  So I ended up spending like the better part of a year in San Francisco. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=768.0600000000001s)]
*  And every morning when I was in San Francisco before court, I would go down [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=772.22s)]
*  to the court, out to the, uh, to the gym in union square. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=776.38s)]
*  Union square is the center of San Francisco and it's the center of commerce. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=782.74s)]
*  It has all the big, um, you know, American iconic American stores like, [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=786.7s)]
*  uh, Macy's and Bloomingdale's and, uh, Norstrom and gap and old Navy and Levi. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=791.9s)]
*  And then it has all the foreign stores like Prada and dealer Valley and, uh, [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=800.62s)]
*  Gucci and. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=804.86s)]
*  Ferragamo. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=805.86s)]

*  Yeah. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=807.46s)]
*  Ferragamo and Burberry and all of those. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=807.74s)]
*  Oh, it's like fifth Avenue is the fifth Avenue of, and people come from Asia all [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=811.74s)]
*  over to do their shopping there. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=817.7s)]
*  So, you know, I went back three weeks ago and it was astonishing. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=820.14s)]
*  Those houses are, or those stores are all boarded up there. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=825.46s)]
*  Every one of them is closed. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=829.7s)]
*  Wow. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=831.22s)]
*  And they're closed because all of them homeless on this read and make them the [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=831.5s)]
*  chaos that's going on in this read. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=837.34s)]
*  San Francisco makes people feel unsafe. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=838.86s)]
*  Well, yes. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=841.5s)]
*  Some guys just did a, started a pop-up bar. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=842.02s)]
*  Do you see that? [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=843.98s)]
*  A guy started a bar where, oh, one was bar. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=844.86s)]
*  We can see you can bring that up. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=848.18s)]
*  Yep. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=851.22s)]
*  I got it. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=851.46s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=853.18s)]
*  Look at this. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=853.3s)]
*  I mean, I think you're starting to see, yeah, people are like, well, I'm so [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=853.8199999999999s)]
*  homeless. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=858.82s)]
*  There's obviously no zoning going on. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=859.38s)]
*  So why don't I open up a Dave and Buster's type of place? [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=862.0200000000001s)]
*  Denver homeless camp features pop-up bar. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=866.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=871.74s)]
*  It's wacky. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=872.0600000000001s)]
*  Let's see a decked out open air. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=875.1400000000001s)]
*  There you go. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=876.6600000000001s)]
*  See, look, you can see the bottles right there. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=877.0600000000001s)]
*  They have a kind of V I wouldn't call it VIP, but I would call it maybe HIV IP. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=879.4200000000001s)]
*  It looks a little dicey over there. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=884.46s)]
*  Sorry. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=886.0600000000001s)]
*  And I shouldn't have said that, man, but, but they, you know, it's, it's, a lot [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=887.46s)]
*  of people have been ill and, um, but yeah, this is, I mean, I think people were just [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=892.1s)]
*  going to start starting businesses, you know? [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=895.06s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=898.26s)]
*  Like I want it. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=898.66s)]
*  That's what it gets to is the tent where the owner lives. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=899.22s)]
*  Or I think the tent, I don't know. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=901.82s)]
*  That could be the pop-up speakeasy, which features lounge chairs, umbrellas, [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=903.78s)]
*  and Astro turf has taken over the sidewalk at 23rd and champ, uh, Champa [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=907.38s)]
*  streets, which the city's growing homeless population has turned into an [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=912.42s)]
*  encampment. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=915.82s)]
*  I love this kind of stuff. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=917.0200000000001s)]
*  So, um, so I. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=918.4200000000001s)]
*  We're hearing there was an open bar. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=921.1800000000001s)]
*  That's what the Denver police patrol division chief said. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=922.5400000000001s)]
*  Um, anyway, yeah, I think, but at least it's evolving. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=925.38s)]
*  It's not just homeless people just being homeless. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=928.1800000000001s)]
*  At least I think you're going to start to see mom and pop businesses out there. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=931.0600000000001s)]
*  You know, here's what, you know, my son, actually, because I, I had a lot of, um, [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=935.22s)]
*  I have a lot of assumptions about why people are homeless. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=942.2600000000001s)]
*  And it's, you know, there's 525,000 homeless people in this country. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=945.18s)]
*  And, but 50% of the unsheltered homeless are in California. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=950.54s)]
*  Okay. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=958.5799999999999s)]
*  But California only has 12% of the population, but it's 50% of the, of [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=958.6999999999999s)]
*  the unsheltered homeless and unsheltered homeless means homeless that don't have [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=962.66s)]
*  a place to sleep at night. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=965.54s)]
*  Yeah, it's people who are on the sidewalks like freelance. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=966.3399999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=970.14s)]
*  Right. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=970.38s)]
*  Or they're in shelter. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=970.78s)]
*  You know, they're, yeah. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=972.18s)]
*  Like free range. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=973.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=974.34s)]
*  So, um, my, here's my assumptions that homelessness is linked to drug addiction. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=976.3000000000001s)]
*  It's linked to mental illness. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=983.7800000000001s)]
*  Um, it's linked to, you know, poverty and that people are in, one of the reasons [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=986.98s)]
*  there's so many homeless in California is that everybody knows that San Francisco [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=994.7s)]
*  has this very generous kind of giving attitude towards social services. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=1000.34s)]
*  And so if you're homeless anywhere else in the country, you, you know, you, [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=1005.26s)]
*  you'd like to move to good weather. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=1010.02s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=1012.3000000000001s)]
*  You know, you don't want to be in New York sleeping on a grate in the middle [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=1012.62s)]
*  of winter when it's snowing, get on a gray out and come out to San Francisco [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=1016.1s)]
*  and, you know, um, and, and celebrate. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=1021.14s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=1024.98s)]
*  And I also had heard this, which turns out not to be true that, that in some [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=1025.3s)]
*  cities like Dallas or Nashville, if you are homeless at day, uh, instead of [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=1033.5s)]
*  putting you in jail, they give you a bus ticket to San Francisco. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=1040.14s)]
*  Oh, wow. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=1044.46s)]
*  So I don't know if it's true or not. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=1045.18s)]
*  And anyway, so my son turned me on to this writer called my son, Connor, who, [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=1046.78s)]
*  who, you know, um, Matthew Desmond and Matthew Desmond has written these [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=1053.02s)]
*  books on homelessness and he's done these studies on homelessness and they, [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=1058.46s)]
*  and in San Francisco, they actually went around and interviewed thousands [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=1063.42s)]
*  and thousands of homeless people. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=1067.1000000000001s)]
*  And what they found is that, um, that the people who are homeless in San [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=1069.46s)]
*  Francisco are from San Francisco and they're from California and they weren't, [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=1076.66s)]
*  they didn't come from somewhere else. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=1081.3s)]
*  So it's not a lot of people you have bus stand or transplants or whatever. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=1082.58s)]
*  Right. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=1086.02s)]
*  He also says that it has, it, it has very little to do with drug addiction. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=1087.22s)]
*  You know, the States like West Virginia has much more drug addiction and San [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=1093.1s)]
*  Francisco, and yet it doesn't have a homeless problem. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=1098.1399999999999s)]
*  So West Virginia has much worse poverty problem than San Francisco. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=1100.78s)]
*  San Francisco actually, I think it's the richest city in the country. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=1104.54s)]
*  I may be wrong, but I think it's the richest. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=1108.02s)]
*  And, um, and it doesn't, so, and in terms of mental illness, you have [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=1110.74s)]
*  to assume they're the same. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=1116.98s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=1118.3s)]
*  There's no reason, but, but also Detroit, Detroit has much higher drug addiction, [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=1118.74s)]
*  much higher poverty, and it doesn't have a homeless problem. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=1123.06s)]
*  And what Matthew Desmond says is the reason for homeless, one reason, one [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=1127.54s)]
*  reason is housing prices. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=1131.86s)]
*  It all has to do with, with housing prices in California. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=1134.06s)]
*  You know, we have the highest housing price in the country. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=1138.62s)]
*  Um, here in LA where we are, the average home cost $815,000, which means you have [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=1141.34s)]
*  to earn $250,000 to be able to pay, to be able to pay for that. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=1150.1399999999999s)]
*  And why do they get so high? [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=1155.58s)]
*  Like, is it demand that makes them so high? [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=1156.74s)]
*  I'm going to tell you this. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=1159.78s)]
*  The average home in our country, two years ago was 215,000. [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=1161.34s)]
*  The today it's 400,000 and the interest rates have gone from three to 7%. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=1168.02s)]
*  So kids today, like your kids and my kids are never going to buy a home. [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=1173.7s)]
*  You know, it used to be, but if you, so if they're not going to buy a home, yeah. [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=1178.62s)]
*  And the median price of home sold by realtors has risen sharply since [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=1182.3s)]
*  the beginning of the pandemic. [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=1184.98s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=1185.94s)]
*  And here's why this is happening. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=1186.06s)]
*  If there's three big companies, BlackRock, State Street, Bankart, these [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=1189.3799999999999s)]
*  are the biggest companies, you know, and they have a monopoly on a lot of the [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=1194.34s)]
*  housing market, right? [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=1197.54s)]
*  Well, what they do, they own everything. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=1198.5s)]
*  Including they own each other. [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=1201.26s)]
*  So it's really just one big company and, and BlackRock that it has $10 trillion [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=1202.58s)]
*  under management, the GDP of California is three or 10 trillion. [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=1207.98s)]
*  The GDP of California is $3 trillion. [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=1214.3s)]
*  And so there are three times the size of California. [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=1217.98s)]
*  California economy is the fifth largest in the world of all nations. [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=1221.1s)]
*  So when you have that much control, can't you just make your own universe? [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=1225.5s)]
*  They can't. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=1229.98s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=1230.3s)]
*  Well, so, so they own, those three companies own 88% of the S and P 500. [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=1230.82s)]
*  So they basically just own everything. [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=1237.34s)]
*  And now that what they've decided is they want to own every single [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=1239.54s)]
*  family home in our country. [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=1243.78s)]
*  So they're that, and, and they're now on track. [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=1245.94s)]
*  There's now on trajectory. [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=1248.9s)]
*  If we continue it on this trajectory, they will own the corporations. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=1250.5s)]
*  We'll own 60% of the, uh, single family homes in our country. [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=1255.62s)]
*  And they're, you know, they, they pay nothing for money. [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=1260.74s)]
*  So they're like, if you're the richest person in the country, their [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=1263.54s)]
*  BlackRock's cost of money is 30% lower than you. [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=1268.5s)]
*  So you, you know, when you're, so you, they're competing against our [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=1271.98s)]
*  kids and your kids, why is it so different? [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=1275.46s)]
*  They want it now. [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=1278.86s)]
*  They want to own everything. [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=1279.78s)]
*  So why is the percentage of the cost of the value of, of borrowing? [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=1280.82s)]
*  Oh, because they are, their credit is so impeccable. [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=1283.74s)]
*  Oh, I see. [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=1287.54s)]
*  They have like a 900. [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=1287.94s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=1289.02s)]
*  So they, they got the better than the best credit rating. [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=1289.94s)]
*  I got six, 70 or something. [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=1293.42s)]
*  I don't know what's okay. [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=1295.1000000000001s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=1296.42s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=1297.1000000000001s)]
*  But isn't that like privatized communism or something? [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=1297.8600000000001s)]
*  That's what it feels like. [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=1300.02s)]
*  Well, yeah, it's like socialism for the rich and you know, this is [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=1300.82s)]
*  barbaric, merciless, ruthless, savage capitalism for the poor. [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=1304.3400000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=1309.9s)]
*  Do you think that there's some trickle down effect of that, that makes [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=1310.06s)]
*  people feel like, yeah, I don't know. [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=1312.62s)]
*  I mean, I was talking, we had this guy, John Vervecki on, and he talks a lot [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=1314.82s)]
*  about meaning and stuff like that, you know, and he said that people feeling [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=1317.78s)]
*  like they're part of a country or they're, they have like a part of a home, [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=1321.06s)]
*  you know, part of a group. [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=1323.9399999999998s)]
*  It, it creates a lot of meaning for them, you know, just in their life. [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=1325.26s)]
*  And I think I noticed even with my own, like probably like our parents and [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=1329.06s)]
*  stuff, I think a lot of them were very like pro America and like, you know, [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=1333.1399999999999s)]
*  they had family members that died for our country and they, you know, it [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=1337.62s)]
*  meant something to them to be part of America. [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=1341.1s)]
*  And then now I think a lot of them see this kind of unfolding or like kind [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=1343.02s)]
*  of the flag kind of like fraying at the stitching, you know, and I think it's [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=1347.1s)]
*  very scary because if you don't know, if you start to feel like you don't have [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=1351.62s)]
*  your country, then I think then you start to feel like, okay, it's every [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=1354.58s)]
*  man for himself in a way. [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=1359.8999999999999s)]
*  Does that make any sense? [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=1361.26s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=1362.26s)]
*  And you know, and you're absolutely right. [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=1362.86s)]
*  There's a poll that came out three weeks ago that showed that in 2013, kids, [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=1366.14s)]
*  but between 18 and 35 years old, that 85% of young Americans said they were [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=1372.26s)]
*  proud of the United States. [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=1378.74s)]
*  And then another poll, the same poll came out three weeks ago. [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=1380.18s)]
*  It showed that only 17% of kids say that they're proud of it to be a, you know, [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=1385.6200000000001s)]
*  I said, we're really, you know, devastating. [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=1390.42s)]
*  But one of the things that you are saying, I think is true that if you own a home, [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=1392.34s)]
*  you care more about your community. [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=1398.1s)]
*  You care about the schools, you know, you care about the police. [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=1400.6999999999998s)]
*  That's a great point. [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=1404.26s)]
*  The hospitals, you take care of your garden, you know, you make it look nice. [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=1404.98s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=1410.02s)]
*  You might be more likely to help your neighbor. [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=1410.22s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=1412.1s)]
*  Cause you're there, you're part of the community and turning us all into, you [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=1412.8999999999999s)]
*  know, and you, you also are a participant in the capitalist system because if you [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=1417.94s)]
*  own a home, you have equity, which means let's say you want to start a business, [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=1424.5400000000002s)]
*  even like a tiny business, like buying, you know, buying a sewing machine. [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=1428.5400000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=1432.5400000000002s)]
*  Doing sewing. [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=1432.7s)]
*  What else can we do? [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=1433.5s)]
*  You can do, or, you know, if you want to start a restaurant, [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=1434.26s)]
*  popcorn, like a caramel corn. [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=1436.7s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=1439.0600000000002s)]
*  Something like that. [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=1440.38s)]
*  That's a great idea. [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=1441.02s)]
*  But you could get a loan on your house. [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=1444.02s)]
*  And so you, you have an entree into the capitalist system. [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=1446.98s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=1450.18s)]
*  And you make you, cause then you're always, everything's possible. [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=1450.38s)]
*  You could sit down with your family at night and be like, Hey, mom and dad are [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=1453.02s)]
*  thinking about doing this business. [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=1455.94s)]
*  What do you guys think? [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=1456.94s)]
*  And maybe your son's proud of you and it creates excitement in your house. [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=1457.94s)]
*  You know? [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=1461.02s)]
*  And even if like, I remember my mom went to law school and she couldn't do it [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=1461.6200000000001s)]
*  because she had too many kids and it was too much work, but I was still always [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=1464.58s)]
*  proud of her that she tried to do it. [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=1467.5s)]
*  You know, like I think, yeah, having the, the financial ability to do stuff like [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=1468.94s)]
*  that is just so important, man. [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=1473.26s)]
*  And then otherwise you feel, yeah, if you're just a renter, if everybody's a [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=1475.06s)]
*  renter, you don't care. [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=1479.2199999999998s)]
*  Nobody, you just feel like you're like a renter by force. [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=1480.1s)]
*  Like you don't even have a choice to be a renter, you know? [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=1483.4199999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=1486.02s)]
*  Um, yeah, that's kind of scary. [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=1486.78s)]
*  How do we battle against that? [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=1488.58s)]
*  And is it something that a president can do or a political official can do, or [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=1490.5s)]
*  it's something that, how do you, how do we turn reverse that? [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=1494.6999999999998s)]
*  Um, well, I don't know. [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=1500.6999999999998s)]
*  I mean, there, there's parts of their, um, of, of what they're doing that. [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=1502.34s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=1510.6999999999998s)]
*  A president can deal with it. [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=1511.3s)]
*  For example, they own all the packing companies. [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=1512.6999999999998s)]
*  There's only four meat packing companies and, and those companies have a [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=1515.1s)]
*  stranglehold on farmers and consumers. [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=1519.98s)]
*  And they should have been prosecuted a long time ago for antitrust, but [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=1524.58s)]
*  because BlackRock is so powerful, nobody will touch them. [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=1528.22s)]
*  Wow. [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=1531.7s)]
*  And so it's a dark arts, huh? [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=1532.74s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=1535.02s)]
*  I mean, they're just, you know, what they're doing is they're just, they're [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=1535.98s)]
*  just strip mining the wealth and equity from the American middle class. [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=1539.38s)]
*  And you see that, you know, yeah, it's sad. [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=1544.5800000000002s)]
*  And how do we, how do you, who is it? [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=1547.66s)]
*  Who is BlackRock? [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=1549.66s)]
*  The head of it is, uh, is the CEO is a guy called Larry Fink. [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=1551.42s)]
*  He's also on the board of directors of the world economic forum. [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=1556.3s)]
*  So in the world economic forum, you know, is meets and Davos. [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=1559.94s)]
*  It's a billionaires boys club. [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=1563.46s)]
*  They meet in Davos every year and they try to figure out what, um, their plans [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=1568.1s)]
*  are for the rest of humanity. [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=1574.46s)]
*  Are they greedy? [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=1576.1s)]
*  I would say they're, they, they have a bad reputation for very self-serving [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=1577.5s)]
*  policies, their big policy is called the great reset and what here's [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=1583.7s)]
*  Klaus Schwab says famously, he says under the great reset, you will have [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=1588.58s)]
*  not, you will own nothing, but you will be happy. [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=1593.06s)]
*  So that's what they believe. [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=1596.1s)]
*  So they do have a belief. [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=1598.1s)]
*  Their belief is that you will own nothing, but you'll be happy. [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=1599.02s)]
*  All of us will own nothing, but they will own everything and they [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=1601.26s)]
*  may be a little happier. [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=1606.4199999999998s)]
*  Who knows? [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=1607.82s)]
*  Wow. [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=1608.62s)]
*  Today's episode is brought to you by better help. [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=1609.54s)]
*  If you, um, if you need therapy or you've considered therapy, it's, [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=1613.3s)]

*  They're looking for something that shows them that something that's out of what [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=1768.6599999999999s)]
*  everything feels like could be possible. [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=1773.8999999999999s)]

*  Do you consider yourself a conspiracy theorist? [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=1781.74s)]
*  No, but I consider myself open to curiosity. [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=1784.8999999999999s)]
*  You know, um, I think, yeah, I consider myself open to curiosity. [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=1790.5s)]
*  I think it'd be silly not to listen to possibility. [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=1796.1s)]
*  And I think some of the, it's sometimes it's the curious guy who at first people [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=1799.82s)]
*  are like, this guy's bon bananas who ends up being bananas foster, you know, [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=1804.78s)]
*  which is good if you've had it or not. [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=1811.26s)]
*  Yeah, it's pretty good. [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=1813.3s)]
*  I'll say that. [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=1813.98s)]
*  Dude, one of my, I used to work at this, at this restaurant and one of my coworkers, [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=1815.06s)]
*  he's like, man, I hate seeing bananas foster on the menu because I was raising a [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=1819.18s)]
*  foster home and it makes me sad. [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=1824.46s)]
*  Not ridiculous. [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=1827.18s)]
*  Well, yeah, like just to equate like bananas foster and being raised in a foster [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=1831.14s)]
*  home, but I was like, but I bet he still had some every now and then, and I think [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=1835.38s)]
*  it made him feel pretty good, but, um, but yeah, I think, would you ask me about it? [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=1838.5s)]
*  Uh-oh. [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=1842.66s)]
*  It is conspiracy theory. [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=1843.7s)]
*  Yeah, I don't think, well, I think since to me, since the new, like the news started [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=1846.6200000000001s)]
*  to get compromised, it feels like a few years ago. [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=1851.78s)]
*  And I'll, one thing I do like using is that word compromise. [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=1854.3000000000002s)]
*  That's kind of like a conspiracy theorist word, you know? [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=1857.18s)]
*  But I feel like when I was, when I was a child, it felt like the news was real. [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=1860.42s)]
*  And it, and it was like, this is the news. [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=1864.3000000000002s)]
*  And it was honest. [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=1866.22s)]
*  I don't know if it was that could have been me romancing it too, but it felt like [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=1867.6200000000001s)]
*  that. [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=1871.58s)]
*  And then at a certain point, which feels like about maybe 10 years ago, the news [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=1872.22s)]
*  started to become more different. [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=1875.98s)]
*  Did you notice that in your life? [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=1878.86s)]
*  Yeah, I did. [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=1881.1799999999998s)]
*  And I watched it happen because originally the, like the, the news, um, you know, [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=1881.9399999999998s)]
*  they, they, going back to when they invented radio in 1928, they passed a law [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=1889.1399999999999s)]
*  that was called the fairness doctrine. [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=1895.62s)]
*  You know, community communications act. [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=1897.74s)]
*  And they said, um, you that all, they did a bunch of things. [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=1899.86s)]
*  They said, nobody could monopolize the news. [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=1905.1399999999999s)]
*  So now there's five companies that own all the TV, all the radio, all the [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=1907.74s)]
*  newspapers and most of the internet content providers. [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=1911.4599999999998s)]
*  And they didn't want that to happen because they thought then, you know, [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=1915.54s)]
*  these large corporations will control what we're thinking because they're going [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=1918.4199999999998s)]
*  to control the information flow. [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=1922.1s)]
*  And that's bad for democracy. [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=1923.62s)]
*  Oh, they said, you, you know, you can own no more than eight radio stations and [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=1926.02s)]
*  you couldn't own a newspaper and a radio station or a television station. [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=1931.3s)]
*  And the same, that sounds like a good choice. [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=1934.74s)]
*  That sounds like very, that seems fair to me. [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=1936.46s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=1938.5s)]
*  They wanted a diversity of ownership. [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=1938.62s)]
*  It was called the fairness doctrine. [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=1940.62s)]
*  But they also said, if you, if you, if you're using the public airwaves, which [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=1941.78s)]
*  means radio or television, that if you make a statement, you need to give the [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=1947.46s)]
*  other side a chance to respond. [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=1952.66s)]
*  And you also need to put the news on every day at times when Americans are [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=1955.8200000000002s)]
*  likely to be at home to see it. [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=1963.0600000000002s)]
*  So they said in order to, oh, like NBC did not own that airwave. [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=1965.26s)]
*  It had a license to use it and it could only use it if it benefited the public [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=1971.94s)]
*  interest, the way that it did that is it said, okay, you're going to create a [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=1976.74s)]
*  news division, the news divisions were always lost money, but they were willing [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=1981.58s)]
*  to pour money in because it was the only way they could hold onto their license. [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=1986.1799999999998s)]
*  And they made a guy. [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=1989.4199999999998s)]
*  Wait, explain that part to me. [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=1991.62s)]
*  Sorry. [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=1992.6599999999999s)]
*  I'm that's rough. [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=1993.1s)]
*  See what they could say is you can, you can use a, uh, the airwave to, to make [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=1994.1399999999999s)]
*  money by entertaining people, right? [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=1999.9399999999998s)]
*  But you have to tell the real news, the authentic news, the important news that [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=2003.02s)]
*  affects policy decisions that Americans have to make about their government. [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=2008.54s)]
*  And you have to do it every day at a time when all Americans are going to be home [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=2013.3s)]
*  are likely to be home. [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=2017.78s)]
*  So they, that's why we had a six o'clock news hour. [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=2018.7s)]
*  It's also a radio stations. [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=2020.86s)]
*  If you probably, I don't know if you remember this or not, but it used to be even [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=2023.8999999999999s)]
*  the top 40 music stations had a news break. [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=2027.6599999999999s)]
*  Like every 15 minutes, there was a short news break where they would tell you the [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=2032.02s)]
*  news. [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=2036.3s)]
*  Paul Harvey. [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=2036.6599999999999s)]
*  Remember him? [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=2037.62s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=2038.1s)]
*  Good day. [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=2038.6599999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=2039.4599999999998s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=2040.26s)]
*  Well, they had to do that. [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=2040.86s)]
*  That was a legal obligation. [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=2042.02s)]
*  And the, and the news divisions were separate from the rest of the operations [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=2044.6999999999998s)]
*  and they were untouchable. [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=2050.7s)]
*  So they bring some, you know, really a credible figure like Newton Minow or the [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=2051.9s)]
*  way to Walter Cronkite and Huntley and Brinkley and John Chester. [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=2058.14s)]
*  These guys were, you know, total integrity people and everybody the most [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=2061.54s)]
*  credible man, the most, the most believed credible man in America was Walter [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=2067.7s)]
*  Cronkite. [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=2072.42s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=2073.02s)]
*  And so, and all of those newscasters were people of extraordinary integrity. [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=2073.86s)]
*  Then what happened is Ronald Reagan, when he ran for president in 1980, he had the [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=2079.58s)]
*  support of the big studio heads in California because he'd been the [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=2084.98s)]
*  California governor. [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=2089.1s)]
*  They wanted to abolish the fairness doctrine so they could get their hands [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=2091.34s)]
*  on the news, consolidate the entire media and under monopoly control. [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=2094.9399999999996s)]
*  And he had the Christian right. [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=2099.02s)]
*  And the Christian broadcasting stations did not want to do, you know, the [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=2101.74s)]
*  fairness. [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=2107.3399999999997s)]
*  They didn't want to show the other side because they didn't want to show Satan's [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=2107.98s)]
*  side of the argument. [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=2110.98s)]
*  Right. [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=2112.02s)]
*  So they all wanted to get rid of the fairness doctrine. [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=2113.06s)]
*  And so Reagan came in and appointed a guy, I think his name was Tom Wheeler to [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=2116.62s)]
*  run the FCC, the federal communication. [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=2122.82s)]
*  And they threw out the fairness doctrine. [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=2127.1400000000003s)]
*  And at that point, you saw this huge consolidation where they started buying [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=2129.02s)]
*  up everything. [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=2132.9s)]
*  You also saw the news divisions were told, okay, you know, we don't, we don't [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=2134.7000000000003s)]
*  really need you to have integrity anymore. [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=2140.7400000000002s)]
*  We need you to make money. [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=2143.42s)]
*  So the news divisions became profit centers. [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=2144.78s)]
*  And so you saw more and more news that was not really news. [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=2147.2200000000003s)]
*  It was, you know, about Brad and J. [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=2152.06s)]
*  Lowe, and it was entertainment. [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=2153.82s)]
*  It was stuff to get eyeballs to make people and violence and war and, you [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=2155.66s)]
*  know. [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=2160.58s)]
*  And so you saw this deterioration where from highly credible people on the news [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=2162.34s)]
*  to people that you have today who are just, you know, propagandists for the [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=2168.2599999999998s)]
*  government and for the pharmaceutical companies. [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=2172.1s)]
*  Muppets, man. [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=2174.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=2175.22s)]
*  The people, people turn into Muppets did. [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=2175.42s)]
*  But so, so whenever they, so the, it was Christian activism that made them end [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=2178.94s)]
*  up making them repeal that. [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=2185.42s)]
*  It was a combination of things. [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=2186.42s)]
*  The, the Christian broadcasters for good reason, you know, they had good reason. [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=2187.7799999999997s)]
*  They didn't want to tell because like, for example, yeah, give me an example. [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=2193.94s)]
*  I'll give you an example that, that, um, NBC, I think it was NBC, either NBC or [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=2198.06s)]
*  ABC was having advertisements. [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=2205.5s)]
*  We're selling advertisements for Mustang, which the automobile. [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=2207.58s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=2210.54s)]
*  That's staying at that point. [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=2211.2200000000003s)]
*  It was the biggest gas guzzling automobile. [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=2213.26s)]
*  And so the, the ad one, an asthma society of America, they hated mustangs. [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=2215.82s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=2222.2200000000003s)]
*  They didn't like mustangs. [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=2222.54s)]
*  Come on. [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=2223.58s)]
*  Dude, if you have asthma, if you get a Mustang, you got a chance with the ladies. [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=2224.7400000000002s)]
*  I feel like, but if you just show up with asthma, it is not a good selling. [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=2229.1s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=2234.8199999999997s)]
*  Has has one speed, dude. [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=2235.06s)]
*  You know, sorry, go on. [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=2238.5s)]
*  So they, they wanted to do an ad saying mustangs are bad because they're making [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=2241.2599999999998s)]
*  us, you know, they're making us have asthma attacks and they, and the [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=2246.2599999999998s)]
*  network didn't want to do it. [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=2250.8599999999997s)]
*  They said, no, you know, they, right. [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=2252.74s)]
*  We want to sell Mustang. [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=2255.2999999999997s)]
*  We want to sell mustangs. [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=2256.1s)]
*  So they, they told the, the asthma society, you can't, you know, we're not [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=2257.8999999999996s)]
*  going to let you, we're not going to sell you ad space. [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=2262.86s)]
*  So they sued, they went to the Supreme court, the Supreme court said, you got it. [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=2264.94s)]
*  You got to allow them to stop both sides. [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=2268.94s)]
*  And they upheld the fairness doctrine. [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=2272.1s)]
*  So you, if you applied that to Christian broadcasting and said, you got it, you're [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=2273.82s)]
*  using a public airway, right? [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=2279.46s)]
*  You know, if there's atheists out there who want to give their side of the story, [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=2281.38s)]
*  maybe you'll have to do that. [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=2286.7000000000003s)]
*  So they didn't want to, they didn't want to do that. [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=2288.1800000000003s)]
*  So they were, you know, and you can see the rationale. [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=2291.02s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=2294.94s)]
*  And then also that leans into more like towards, yeah, things being able to create [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=2295.22s)]
*  monopolies then it seems like, you know, [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=2298.78s)]
*  yeah, well, the monopoly exactly. [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=2300.42s)]
*  And now we're, we are where we are today. [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=2302.54s)]
*  Well, it's sad every city you go to, like I go to a city, if you, you go as a [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=2304.34s)]
*  comedian, you go to do radio sometimes before. [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=2308.06s)]
*  And, you know, uh, it used to be, you had kind of a local radio station and now [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=2310.14s)]
*  all of them are, most of them are kind of clear channel, you know, and I'm not [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=2313.9s)]
*  denouncing clear channel, I don't, but they're all like, usually like part of a [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=2317.2599999999998s)]
*  bigger group, you know, and you can't find like a local newspaper anymore. [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=2320.54s)]
*  Like that used to be like part of the community, like getting yourself in the [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=2324.7799999999997s)]
*  newspaper, you would get like a little trophy for, you know, you didn't do [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=2328.18s)]
*  nothing really, maybe you found a missing person or something and they would put [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=2332.7799999999997s)]
*  you in the newspaper or something, you know, but it was like, you kind of got to [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=2336.38s)]
*  see like everything that was going on in your community, like baseball scores for [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=2339.5s)]
*  little league games, I think things that made you feel attached to your environment, [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=2343.14s)]
*  you know, and, uh, they don't have that anymore. [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=2346.74s)]
*  It's like, everything's just too big now to get it to fit into like, um, smaller [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=2349.14s)]
*  communities, you know, or maybe you'll get a paper like once a week now or [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=2353.66s)]
*  something, you know, it's just different. [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=2357.02s)]
*  No, I, you know, I agree 100% with that. [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=2358.74s)]
*  I think that's, you know, and I think there's a real appetite for local news. [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=2361.06s)]
*  People want to know what the, you know, what happened on the baseball. [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=2365.86s)]
*  I mean, like, you know, I grew up reading about, you know, kids who I was playing, [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=2368.9s)]
*  you know, sports with. [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=2374.42s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=2375.58s)]
*  Right. [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=2376.58s)]
*  And, um, and you'd read about them in the local papers. [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=2377.02s)]
*  They were heroes to you. [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=2379.7400000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=2380.78s)]
*  I would say you had local heroes, you know, it's like, yeah, now it just feels [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=2381.02s)]
*  like they want all your heroes to be like from the Marvel universe, or you're not [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=2384.7s)]
*  even allowed to have a hero anymore, you know? [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=2388.78s)]
*  Um, and I don't know, maybe I'm, maybe I'm romancing that a little bit, but I [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=2391.06s)]
*  definitely notice it when I go home, I can't find like the local news and see [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=2395.66s)]
*  kind of what's going on and then, so then you're not attached to it. [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=2399.14s)]
*  You don't really, where do you, you consider home Nashville? [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=2401.86s)]
*  I'm from, uh, Louisiana from Covington, Louisiana. [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=2404.7s)]
*  So, but, um, Covington is that, is that in the Delta or something? [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=2407.7799999999997s)]
*  No, Covington is south of the day. [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=2413.62s)]
*  It's kind of like, uh, let me see. [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=2415.74s)]
*  Southwest of the, uh, Delta. [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=2417.06s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=2421.06s)]
*  Covington is over there. [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=2421.66s)]
*  We had, I'll tell you something neat about Covington. [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=2422.66s)]
*  Well, we have the tallest statue of Ronald Reagan and you're welcome to [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=2425.06s)]
*  come see it whenever you want. [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=2428.14s)]
*  Really? [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=2429.8599999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=2430.3799999999997s)]
*  And Michael Lennon was supposed to come there one time, but he couldn't make it. [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=2431.06s)]
*  Michael Landon. [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=2434.98s)]
*  He was supposed to stop in. [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=2436.1s)]
*  He didn't make it. [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=2437.14s)]
*  That's a big selling point for that. [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=2437.7799999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=2440.54s)]
*  Michael Lennon was almost here. [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=2440.7s)]
*  I guess it's a pretty big, look at that statue though, buddy. [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=2442.62s)]
*  Oh, I can't tell how big it is. [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=2445.2999999999997s)]
*  It's bigger than the trees though. [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=2446.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=2447.8999999999996s)]
*  It's 10 feet tall or it could be somebody said it's even 12 feet tall, but I think [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=2448.1s)]
*  that somebody had a bad ruler on them. [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=2451.8599999999997s)]
*  But, um, also Lee Harvey Oswald went to our middle school there, uh, for a little bit. [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=2454.14s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=2460.7s)]
*  And what else? [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=2461.58s)]
*  Um, the Tulane primate facility is there and they tested the polio vaccine. [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=2463.62s)]
*  That's where they actually made the polio vaccine that ended up giving cancer to a [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=2469.14s)]
*  lot of women to like cervical cancer. [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=2472.5s)]
*  But, um, it had a virus and a monkey virus and it called SV 40. [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=2474.98s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=2479.2599999999998s)]

*  Yeah. [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=2480.54s)]
*  And some of the monkeys got out when I was a kid and we got to get out of YMCA [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=2481.06s)]
*  summer camp to help them look for them, which is pretty crazy when you think about it. [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=2483.8199999999997s)]
*  Is that true? [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=2487.14s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=2487.74s)]

*  with a couple of local police. [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=2491.54s)]
*  Wow. [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=2493.46s)]

*  Um, but anyway, there's actually, you know, there's a book. [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=2495.6200000000003s)]
*  You go the escape right there. [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=2499.1000000000004s)]

*  Is that it? [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=2508.94s)]
*  Maybe it's just Mary's monkey. [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=2510.2200000000003s)]
*  Dr. [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=2511.3s)]

*  And it's about the, uh, the secret lab. [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=2514.86s)]
*  It's about the Kennedy assassination, but it's about the Tulane lab and, uh, that [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=2517.34s)]
*  there are people involved in that lab who were, you know, who were involved with. [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=2522.26s)]
*  Lee Harvey Oswald. [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=2527.38s)]
*  And, um, did you go down a lot of rabbit holes ever like kind of searching, like [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=2528.82s)]
*  just about information about, you know, I, I feel like I'm really, I'm really [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=2532.46s)]
*  evidence-based, so I don't make any presumptions, but I, I read everything. [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=2537.78s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=2543.78s)]

*  Yeah. [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=2549.86s)]

*  I think, I don't know if I've read all of it, but I've definitely read a decent [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=2550.22s)]
*  amount of it. [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=2552.58s)]
*  Um, man, yeah. [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=2553.3799999999997s)]
*  Congratulations. [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=2555.3799999999997s)]

*  Yeah. [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=2559.7799999999997s)]
*  That's cool, man. [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=2561.14s)]
*  You didn't see that coming. [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=2562.9399999999996s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=2564.18s)]
*  Uh, I don't know. [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=2564.4599999999996s)]
*  Cause I think I almost think I asked you about it. [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=2565.8999999999996s)]
*  We'll have to go back and see if there was a clip where I asked you if you [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=2568.62s)]
*  would at some point, cause it was so well spoken. [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=2571.02s)]
*  I didn't have any intention. [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=2574.8199999999997s)]
*  Um, was it hard to, did you have to convince your [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=2577.4599999999996s)]
*  family that it was okay for you to run? [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=2579.9s)]
*  Well, the one person I had to convince was my wife. [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=2581.86s)]
*  My kids were like, uh, I actually went up to Boston and I had three boys who [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=2585.7000000000003s)]
*  were in Boston at that point. [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=2593.1800000000003s)]
*  And I went out and took them out to lunch and they were like, they [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=2596.06s)]
*  weren't like, okay, go get them dad. [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=2601.06s)]
*  They were like, okay, this is what you, you know, buy the ticket, take the ride. [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=2603.34s)]
*  You know, and they, they were not, um, you know, I think now they're much happier [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=2607.8599999999997s)]
*  about it because the way it's kind of turned out, but they didn't know what [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=2613.3799999999997s)]
*  was going to happen at that point. [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=2618.2999999999997s)]
*  And then Cheryl, who, you know, um, uh, it took, she took a lot of convincing, [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=2619.74s)]
*  but what happened is I was, you know, I thought at one point because they [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=2627.2999999999997s)]
*  were censoring me, in fact, you got, you know, we got censored. [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=2631.18s)]
*  Our episode got taken down. [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=2635.4199999999996s)]
*  That's right. [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=2636.7s)]
*  And then miraculously got put up again. [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=2637.4599999999996s)]
*  How did that happen? [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=2640.5s)]
*  Like a month ago. [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=2642.14s)]
*  Oh, it came back up on YouTube. [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=2643.8999999999996s)]
*  One of the episodes that have been taken down came back up on YouTube. [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=2645.3399999999997s)]
*  I mean, it had been gone, Bobby, it had been gone and then it just showed back up. [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=2649.06s)]
*  That's weird. [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=2655.7799999999997s)]
*  Well, we sued them. [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=2656.4599999999996s)]
*  But I doubt if that's the reason, cause there's YouTube. [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=2658.7799999999997s)]
*  Yeah, they're still taking our stuff down. [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=2661.14s)]
*  Wow. [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=2664.06s)]
*  Good for you. [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=2664.58s)]
*  That's cool when you're a lawyer, cause then you can sue somebody if you need to. [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=2666.1400000000003s)]
*  That's great idea. [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=2668.5400000000004s)]
*  He has actually made a wager whether or not that episode would be taken down. [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=2670.1400000000003s)]
*  RFK. [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=2674.1800000000003s)]
*  Uh, he said it would be, and he'll bet him that it wouldn't. [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=2674.98s)]
*  Oh dang. [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=2679.34s)]
*  How much was it for? [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=2679.82s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=2680.82s)]

*  We have the clip. [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=2682.46s)]
*  One sec. [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=2683.42s)]
*  All right. [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=2684.7000000000003s)]
*  It's going to get interesting. [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=2685.1000000000004s)]
*  We'll see if anybody's getting paid this week right here. [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=2686.78s)]
*  Or other, God, this can be bad. [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=2689.1800000000003s)]
*  Well, whatever it is, Bob, we'll donate to your campaign. [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=2691.7400000000002s)]

*  Well, let's play this question. [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=2703.6200000000003s)]
*  They came in actually right here from a guy, uh, for you, Bobby. [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=2704.6200000000003s)]

*  Big question right here from somebody that came in. [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=2757.2999999999997s)]
*  Anyway, last night you asked about donations. [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=2760.22s)]

*  And, uh, we got $2.2 million. [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=2772.14s)]
*  What? [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=2776.4599999999996s)]
*  We're, you know, we're doing well on donations. [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=2777.1s)]
*  Um, how was it? [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=2779.9399999999996s)]
*  Cause you were kind of like looked at as like a guy that was like a [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=2781.42s)]
*  nutcase by some people, right? [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=2786.2200000000003s)]
*  Not by me. [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=2789.1800000000003s)]
*  I thought you were definitely curious and active, you know, and I knew you as a [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=2790.38s)]
*  person, so I knew that like, you seem like a, like as normal as a guy could be to me. [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=2794.62s)]
*  You know, were you surprised when people started to get on board though with you? [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=2800.1400000000003s)]
*  Like, cause I remember I listened to you. [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=2803.7400000000002s)]
*  I mean, I, I listened to you on Rogan and I thought it was one of his best episodes. [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=2805.62s)]
*  I thought it was just, I remember you thanking him for letting him, [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=2809.22s)]
*  letting you speak. [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=2812.8199999999997s)]
*  Right. [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=2813.74s)]
*  And it was like, you know, I remember just listening and I just got a clear [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=2814.58s)]
*  layout of exactly kind of where you'd been and how you ended up where you were. [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=2818.5s)]
*  You know? [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=2823.2599999999998s)]
*  Um, and I thought it was just awesome. [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=2824.06s)]
*  And I thought that was such a great interview. [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=2825.8599999999997s)]
*  Did things start to turn after that or when did things kind of start [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=2827.3799999999997s)]
*  to turn, do you feel like? [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=2829.8599999999997s)]
*  The big turn for me was a podcast I did before that called all in, you know, that [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=2831.3799999999997s)]
*  podcast. [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=2836.94s)]
*  It's David Sachs and it's a bunch of tech people who are, you know, leaders in [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=2838.26s)]
*  the, in the kind of tech Bitcoin community. [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=2846.9s)]
*  They're San Francisco based. [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=2852.54s)]
*  Okay. [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=2854.7400000000002s)]
*  I see you. [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=2855.02s)]
*  I get David Sachs, David Friedberg. [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=2855.3s)]
*  Okay. [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=2857.14s)]
*  And it's very, very popular. [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=2858.26s)]
*  I mean, I, I cannot, I can't tell you how popular the reason I know how popular it [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=2861.1800000000003s)]
*  is, is I almost every day somebody comes up to me and says, I saw you on that. [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=2869.1800000000003s)]
*  Wow. [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=2873.34s)]
*  No matter where I am in the country. [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=2874.38s)]
*  And it's a very weird demographic because it's not, it's all kinds of people. [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=2875.94s)]
*  Like it'll be like an old lady and you know, young college kids and. [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=2881.82s)]
*  That's amazing. [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=2888.1800000000003s)]
*  I'm not going to check this out all in with Shamoff, Jason Sachs and [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=2888.82s)]
*  Friedberg or Fryberg. [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=2892.94s)]
*  And so, you know, I went on there and there's four guys and they all kind of [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=2896.5800000000004s)]
*  grilled me and, and then, you know, then Rogan brought me on Megan Kelly was [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=2900.46s)]
*  really good with me. [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=2909.06s)]
*  She, she had me on about three times when, you know, nobody would let me on. [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=2910.1800000000003s)]
*  And then Fox started letting me on a lot. [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=2916.26s)]
*  And so I could go on my, you know, the thing is that my, I get a lot of [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=2919.06s)]
*  eyeballs when I go on. [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=2923.2200000000003s)]
*  And so they, I think they, this is what they told me, cause I went and met with [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=2924.54s)]
*  their editorial board that, that, you know, it was, that I was getting more [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=2928.26s)]
*  eyeballs than any other guest. [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=2935.3s)]
*  Wow. [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=2936.86s)]
*  On Fox. [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=2938.1s)]
*  Yeah, on Fox. [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=2939.02s)]
*  And, and I think the same as CNN, but CNN won't let me on. [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=2940.5s)]
*  The only guy who's let me on CNN was Michael Smirconish and he, it was a very [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=2944.02s)]
*  short interview, but he got in a lot of trouble for it. [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=2949.86s)]
*  Wow. [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=2956.62s)]
*  So you're running for, you're running right now. [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=2958.58s)]
*  You're running for president. [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=2960.62s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=2962.1s)]
*  With the democratic under the D democratic party, right? [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=2962.82s)]
*  At the moment. [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=2967.42s)]
*  Okay. [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=2968.18s)]
*  And so the, is it usual, is it normal that someone is able to run against the [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=2968.7799999999997s)]
*  incumbent, just, I want to make this clear from audience because some audience, I [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=2976.14s)]
*  hear words a lot of times and I don't know what they mean. [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=2978.8599999999997s)]
*  Right? [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=2981.1s)]
*  So like the incumbent is the guy who's already in office. [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=2981.7799999999997s)]
*  Right? [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=2984.62s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=2984.9s)]
*  So if a president has already done one term, then he's the incumbent as he goes [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=2985.22s)]
*  up to do the second term, right? [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=2989.8599999999997s)]
*  And he has to run against someone who's submitted by the other party. [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=2991.8199999999997s)]
*  Well, he, he ultimately has to run about it. [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=2994.7799999999997s)]
*  The other party is going to nominate somebody to run against them. [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=2997.8599999999997s)]
*  So the Republicans will nominate somebody to run against. [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=3001.7799999999997s)]
*  But if you're a Democrat, if you're popular within your own party, a lot of [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=3004.1s)]
*  times you won't have a challenger from when to within your own parties. [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=3010.5s)]
*  So you only have to go to the prize fight. [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=3013.4199999999996s)]
*  You don't have to, you know, fight all the blue guys who are coming after you. [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=3015.5s)]
*  But who determines if they have to fight all the bulls? [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=3019.54s)]
*  It would be, you know, me, I, I, like I would run against him, but my father ran [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=3022.02s)]
*  against Linda Johnson when, you know, Linda Johnson in 68, Linda Johnson was [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=3026.58s)]
*  an incumbent, a democratic president and my father challenged him and ultimately, [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=3032.7s)]
*  um, Johnson withdrew, uh, and he pulled out of the way it raised. [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=3038.5s)]
*  And then my father ran out on the primaries. [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=3045.22s)]
*  Um, and he was killed. [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=3048.62s)]
*  My father was killed on the night of the last night of the primary. [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=3050.02s)]
*  So June 6th, um, he won, you know, the last primary is California, South [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=3053.46s)]
*  Dakota, and a couple of others. [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=3059.3s)]
*  And he was killed that night. [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=3060.78s)]
*  I, my uncle Ted Kennedy ran in 1980 against Jimmy Carter, who was a [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=3063.7000000000003s)]
*  president of his own party. [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=3068.94s)]
*  Um, so yeah, it's not uncommon for, for people to run against a president [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=3071.1s)]
*  of their own party and, you know, I, I've had a long friendship with Biden. [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=3076.06s)]
*  I've known president Biden for at least 40 years. [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=3080.46s)]
*  Oh, wow. [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=3083.3s)]
*  And, uh, and you know, he has a statue, a bust, my father on the behind him in [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=3084.1800000000003s)]
*  the Oval Office, any picture that you have of Biden, there's a bust of my father. [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=3090.6600000000003s)]
*  You can call him up now. [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=3095.7000000000003s)]
*  Um, and there's five members of my family who are working in the administration. [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=3099.1000000000004s)]
*  In the Biden administration. [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=3103.7400000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=3104.5s)]
*  Wow. [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=3104.9s)]
*  Different, you know, different ways. [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=3105.6200000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=3107.2200000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=3107.6200000000003s)]
*  And so, uh, do you think he'll get the nomination from his party for the 2024? [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=3108.5s)]
*  Well, I think I could beat him in the, uh, and yeah, you can see in that middle [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=3115.42s)]
*  one, the second one from the right up there at that one, there's a, there's a [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=3121.22s)]
*  bust of my father behind him. [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=3125.38s)]
*  Wow. [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=3126.9s)]
*  That's awesome. [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=3127.2599999999998s)]
*  That's so cool, man. [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=3129.94s)]
*  That'd be cool if my, were my dad. [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=3131.18s)]
*  Yeah, it's wonderful. [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=3133.5s)]
*  Um, do you think that he will get the, yeah, so I guess I have two questions. [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=3135.98s)]
*  Cause some of the process, I think I can beat him if they give me a fair fight. [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=3139.46s)]
*  Right. [[00:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=3142.86s)]
*  Okay. [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=3143.58s)]
*  But before that, do you think that they will, he'll get the nomination? [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=3144.58s)]
*  Well, I think I could get the nomination. [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=3147.9s)]
*  Okay. [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=3150.42s)]
*  If they gave me a fair fight. [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=3150.74s)]
*  I see. [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=3152.06s)]
*  Do you think that you're currently getting a fair fight? [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=3152.58s)]
*  No. [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=3154.7s)]
*  Why? [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=3155.14s)]
*  Well, because they're, they're doing, you know, the democratic [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=3155.98s)]
*  party is supposed to be neutral. [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=3159.9s)]
*  They're not supposed to choose favorites, but they actually endorsed them a week [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=3162.46s)]
*  after he declared and his campaign is being run out of the democratic party office. [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=3165.94s)]
*  Which seems like convoluted, huh? [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=3171.98s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=3173.5s)]
*  It's well, it's not, it's a conflict and you know, the party should be separate [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=3173.5800000000004s)]
*  from the president, even if they're of the same, they're supposed to be, even [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=3178.26s)]
*  if they're both democratic. [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=3182.26s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=3183.6600000000003s)]
*  The party should be neutral and say, look, we're going to be the [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=3184.06s)]
*  referees in this fight. [[00:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=3187.3s)]
*  It's like, okay. [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=3188.5s)]
*  It's like if you went to a football game and the referee in the game was [[00:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=3190.02s)]
*  wearing the same uniform as you're the guys you were playing against. [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=3194.5s)]
*  Right. [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=3198.1s)]
*  You say, Hey, yeah. [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=3198.2999999999997s)]
*  So that's what they're doing. [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=3200.38s)]
*  And what they've done is they've taken the States that voted most strongly [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=3202.38s)]
*  against Biden last time around. [[00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=3207.06s)]
*  And they've said, if anybody visits those, if I visit those States and no [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=3208.74s)]
*  vote in that state will count in the election. [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=3213.54s)]
*  So if I go to New Hampshire, which I did any vote that I get in [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=3216.54s)]
*  New Hampshire will not count. [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=3221.1800000000003s)]
*  And if I go to what? [[00:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=3223.1400000000003s)]
*  And for me, so if I beat Biden in New Hampshire and I went all the delegates, [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=3224.42s)]
*  those delegates will not be allowed into the convention. [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=3229.1800000000003s)]
*  But how can they just say that? [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=3231.5800000000004s)]
*  Isn't there like a democratic process that did that overrides that? [[00:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=3232.82s)]
*  You would think, but actually it, the party makes its own rules and there was a, [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=3236.1800000000003s)]
*  you know, Bernie Sanders, they did the same thing to Bernie Sanders. [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=3241.26s)]
*  Yeah, they cooked him. [[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=3244.02s)]
*  And he sued them and said, you know, you guys were fit rigged the game against me. [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=3245.18s)]
*  You fixed it. [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=3250.7s)]
*  And the court said, yes, they did fix it, but actually it's a private club [[00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=3251.58s)]
*  and they're allowed to fix it. [[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=3256.5s)]
*  They can make up any rules they want. [[00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=3257.98s)]
*  They can do anything they want. [[00:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=3259.54s)]
*  So. [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=3260.78s)]
*  See, this just leans so much more into like this stuff that like people feel [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=3261.78s)]
*  like their vote doesn't matter. [[00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=3265.94s)]
*  Cork can see ZNC had the right to rig primaries against Sanders. [[00:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=3268.26s)]
*  And that and that's Debbie Wasserman Schultz who. [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=3272.1800000000003s)]
*  You know, [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=3278.42s)]
*  Chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz for violating the DNC charter about rigging [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=3278.98s)]
*  the democratic presidential primaries for Hillary Clinton against Bernie Sanders. [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=3281.94s)]
*  And she's the one who tried to silence me when I testified before Congress [[00:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=3285.02s)]
*  a couple of weeks ago. [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=3288.82s)]
*  Wow. [[00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=3289.82s)]
*  And so anyway, it just feels like so it feels so dirty at every turn. [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=3291.94s)]
*  Cold Turkey. [[00:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=3298.02s)]
*  It may be great on sandwiches, but there's a better way to break your habits. [[00:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=3299.66s)]
*  We're not talking about some voodoo or seance or E or anything like that. [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=3304.66s)]
*  We're not talking about getting tickled by your crazy neighbor until [[00:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=3309.3399999999997s)]
*  you just belch up a secret. [[00:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=3313.06s)]
*  We're talking about our sponsor fume. [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=3315.42s)]
*  That's right. [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=3318.58s)]
*  They look at the problem in a different way. [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=3319.7s)]

*  If my vote doesn't matter. [[00:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=3492.38s)]
*  And we should be, I think we should, both parties should be conducting elections [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=3493.7400000000002s)]
*  that are incredibly fair and everybody looks at them and says, okay, this is a [[00:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=3497.98s)]
*  model that America's the exemplary democracy for the world. [[00:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=3502.66s)]
*  Should be. [[00:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=3505.9s)]

*  vote gets counted and you know. [[00:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=3511.58s)]
*  Yeah, it's starting to remind me of the articles I would read in the papers of [[00:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=3513.54s)]
*  like Venezuela, a lot of the central American countries where they would be, [[00:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=3515.86s)]
*  um, there would be coups and stuff and they would be overriding the process [[00:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=3519.42s)]
*  cause they thought the elections weren't fair, you know, or, you know, the [[00:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=3523.06s)]
*  Soviet in the Soviet Union, the communist party, they said, we're a democracy, [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=3526.02s)]
*  but the party would pick the candidate and that'd be the only guy you can vote [[00:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=3532.58s)]
*  for. [[00:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=3536.06s)]
*  And that is exactly what they're doing here. [[00:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=3536.6600000000003s)]
*  And they're saying they're, you know, they're good. [[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=3538.78s)]
*  They're saying the good news and the bad news. [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=3541.02s)]
*  We have a democracy, but there's only one guy and everybody's got to vote for him. [[00:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=3543.86s)]
*  But do they have the right to do that because he's the incumbent? [[00:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=3548.42s)]
*  I understand. [[00:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=3551.94s)]
*  They have the right to do it within the democratic party process. [[00:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=3552.42s)]
*  Okay. [[00:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=3555.3399999999997s)]
*  And then, so they, you know, they're going to, you know, uh, it's weird. [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=3556.2999999999997s)]
*  What's happening now, Theo, because the press is now turning against president [[00:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=3562.42s)]
*  Biden. [[00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=3567.98s)]
*  So it has been interesting to see some of that, huh? [[00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=3568.9s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=3571.46s)]
*  It's the first time ever I've seen some of the headlines that are, you know, either [[00:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=3571.7s)]
*  bringing like his son's issues into it or, um, discussing impeachment. [[00:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=3576.34s)]
*  I'd never seen that before, you know? [[00:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=3580.7400000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=3582.9s)]
*  And the Washington post, uh, there's a very famous journalist called David [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=3583.3s)]
*  Ignatius, who is, uh, linked to the intelligence community. [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=3588.82s)]
*  And he kind of speaks for the, if you, if you, you know, if you, if you want to [[00:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=3593.5s)]
*  talk about the deep state, David Ignatius is the voice of the deep state. [[00:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=3597.34s)]
*  And he came out and said, Biden's got to step down and then immediately [[01:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=3601.78s)]
*  CNN, um, published a, when, uh, did a stories about all Biden's lies. [[01:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=3605.9s)]
*  And then I think today, either Washington post or New York times, or more [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=3614.5400000000004s)]
*  endowed, well, if you had a story today about all of, uh, his lies. [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=3618.46s)]
*  So you see these attacks on Biden that are, that were not happening before. [[01:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=3624.3s)]
*  Right. [[01:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=3629.6600000000003s)]
*  And, you know, and you wonder what, what is going on. [[01:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=3630.6200000000003s)]
*  Well, if he does step down, I hope it's not a far step, to be honest with you, [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=3634.7000000000003s)]
*  because I don't know if he can handle it. [[01:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=3637.5400000000004s)]
*  You know, I think the sat, the saddest thing to me is I feel like, I feel [[01:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=3640.38s)]
*  like Mr. [[01:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=3645.0200000000004s)]
*  Biden just isn't healthy. [[01:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=3645.78s)]
*  He doesn't seem like mentally healthy. [[01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=3646.86s)]
*  Right. [[01:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=3649.46s)]
*  To me. [[01:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=3649.7400000000002s)]
*  And I don't know, it could be that they edit clips to look a certain way. [[01:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=3650.0200000000004s)]
*  He just seems like he's, he doesn't seem as healthy as he once was. [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=3653.1400000000003s)]
*  Right. [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=3656.86s)]
*  And so it, I feel like to me, it's like a bad example that we, this is [[01:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=3657.7000000000003s)]
*  what we do with our old people. [[01:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=3661.46s)]
*  We put them out. [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=3662.5400000000004s)]
*  It's like, this is like a, you know, somebody we're just using it just, I [[01:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=3663.42s)]
*  don't know, it just seems like a bad example of how to treat other people. [[01:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=3667.66s)]
*  You know, like my father and he were to me, what would seem like ailing, like [[01:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=3671.06s)]
*  mentally just kind of either losing his, uh, composure that he probably once had. [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=3676.38s)]
*  And it could be dementia. [[01:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=3681.1s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=3681.94s)]
*  His cognitive, that's what I'm saying. [[01:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=3683.3s)]
*  If he were losing it, it would just hurt my feelings if they kept [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=3684.58s)]
*  wheeling him out there, you know, but I don't know, maybe that's what he wants. [[01:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=3687.1800000000003s)]
*  And we just don't hear that part of it. [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=3690.54s)]
*  Um, but how, so what is your path in to really get to the presidential [[01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=3692.14s)]
*  nomination for 2024? [[01:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=3697.98s)]
*  Is there a path for you? [[01:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=3699.94s)]
*  Do you feel like? [[01:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=3700.9s)]
*  Well, if president Biden steps out, you know, the decision kind of has [[01:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=3702.7s)]
*  to be made by October 15th because they're soon because you'll know before Halloween. [[01:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=3706.74s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=3713.66s)]
*  The, um, October 15th, um, you have to start, uh, qualifying in certain states. [[01:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=3714.94s)]
*  So that you, you have to declare whether you're a Democrat or an [[01:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=3724.06s)]
*  independent or Republican. [[01:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=3727.1400000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=3728.5s)]
*  And you can't, a lot of people think, well, you can run as a Democrat. [[01:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=3729.86s)]
*  And then if you lose everything, then you can just switch to independent [[01:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=3733.06s)]
*  and run on independent, but you can't do that. [[01:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=3737.42s)]
*  There's a lot of states have sore loser laws that make it so that you have to [[01:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=3740.2200000000003s)]
*  choose early and you can't, you can't come in, you know, once you've chosen [[01:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=3745.1800000000003s)]
*  Democrat, you can't switch independent. [[01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=3749.5s)]
*  That's fair. [[01:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=3751.5800000000004s)]
*  Cause every year they let Odell Beckham Jr. [[01:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=3752.1000000000004s)]
*  join another team right before the Superbowl. [[01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=3753.94s)]
*  And I feel like it doesn't seem fair to anybody. [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=3756.34s)]
*  Just, I get that he's good, but it doesn't seem that fair. [[01:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=3758.3s)]
*  Um, so when do you have to, so, but you've already chosen that you're a Democrat, [[01:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=3761.02s)]
*  right? [[01:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=3766.1000000000004s)]
*  I mean, you've been a lifelong Democrat. [[01:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=3766.3s)]
*  Is there a chance that you would run as an independent? [[01:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=3768.02s)]
*  Do you look at that ever? [[01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=3770.3799999999997s)]
*  Like, and how do you even evaluate that? [[01:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=3771.3799999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=3773.46s)]
*  I mean, I, you know, if they really shut down the process, we're, we're right now, [[01:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=3773.9399999999996s)]
*  you know, we're grappling with the DNC trying to get them to do the right thing. [[01:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=3780.62s)]
*  But if they rig the process so that I can't possibly win, which is how it's rigged [[01:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=3785.8999999999996s)]
*  right now, then I would have to look at other options. [[01:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=3791.74s)]
*  I would have to look at running as, you know, maybe outside of the party or something. [[01:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=3795.54s)]
*  I don't know exactly what I do. [[01:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=3800.1s)]
*  I'm hoping that they'll open up the process and let me run. [[01:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=3801.9s)]
*  Um, you know, we polled this week and I, if, if I, if president Biden steps down, [[01:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=3805.86s)]
*  um, I, uh, I have a pretty clear path to the nomination. [[01:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=3812.06s)]
*  My numbers are better than any other Democrats, including the [[01:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=3816.18s)]
*  vice president, Kamala Harris. [[01:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=3819.14s)]
*  Um, so, and then, uh, if he stays in and they give me a fair fight, I think I can beat him. [[01:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=3822.42s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=3829.58s)]
*  Um, so, wow. [[01:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=3830.46s)]
*  So it's kind of, it's tough to figure out kind of, you're kind of just [[01:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=3832.78s)]
*  navigating the space, huh? [[01:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=3835.3s)]
*  Who's ahead in the national polls. [[01:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=3837.22s)]
*  Well, he beats me among Democrats in the national polls. [[01:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=3838.86s)]
*  No, but if you could get a third of people to switch that were [[01:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=3843.42s)]
*  Republicans and a third that were Democrats. [[01:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=3845.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=3847.98s)]
*  That's the thing is that those polls aren't looking at the Republicans who [[01:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=3848.38s)]
*  want to vote for me or the independence. [[01:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=3852.2200000000003s)]
*  Okay. [[01:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=3855.5s)]
*  Um, if you can't get it run this year, would you run in the next, next one? [[01:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=3856.5s)]
*  No, I'm thinking that far ahead. [[01:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=3861.1000000000004s)]
*  Is it? [[01:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=3862.94s)]
*  Okay. [[01:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=3863.38s)]
*  You're not. [[01:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=3863.5800000000004s)]
*  No, I'm not thinking all about that. [[01:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=3863.94s)]
*  Okay. [[01:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=3866.46s)]
*  Oh, um, some people say that you are that the Republican party, like set you up to [[01:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=3867.82s)]
*  take the, you ever hear, do you hear about this? [[01:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=3872.7000000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=3875.42s)]
*  I hear that and I'm like a stocking horse for Trump. [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=3875.78s)]
*  And all I can say is, you know, I don't believe that. [[01:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=3878.46s)]
*  I'm just asking you. [[01:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=3881.6200000000003s)]
*  I don't believe that. [[01:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=3882.7000000000003s)]
*  Well, you should ask me. [[01:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=3883.38s)]
*  I mean, you shouldn't do it publicly like you just did. [[01:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=3885.34s)]
*  Really? [[01:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=3887.6600000000003s)]
*  No, no, I'm just kidding. [[01:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=3888.1000000000004s)]
*  Okay. [[01:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=3888.94s)]
*  No, you should ask me. [[01:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=3889.98s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=3891.1000000000004s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=3891.38s)]
*  But the, here's the thing. [[01:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=3891.98s)]
*  Here's the problem with that. [[01:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=3893.6600000000003s)]
*  First of all, if the Democrats make rules that say I cannot win, you know, and then [[01:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=3894.94s)]
*  they complain about me running somewhere else. [[01:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=3901.82s)]
*  It's like, it's like the, you know, it's like a guy who murders his parents and [[01:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=3904.1s)]
*  then throws himself on the mercy of the court because he's an orphan. [[01:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=3909.38s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=3913.02s)]
*  No, they're, they're, they're, they're trying to get public sympathy for a [[01:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=3913.2999999999997s)]
*  problem that they created. [[01:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=3917.22s)]
*  I hate when I see bananas foster on the menu. [[01:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=3918.38s)]
*  But no, I see what you're saying. [[01:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=3922.7799999999997s)]
*  It's almost like they're playing two cards that are trying to do two different [[01:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=3923.7s)]
*  things, but one of them kind of concede that there's some truth in the other one. [[01:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=3926.74s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=3930.3399999999997s)]
*  But the, and then the other thing is that I take more votes from president [[01:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=3930.74s)]

*  I did not know about the cats. [[01:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=4337.74s)]
*  Some man gave him two hats, two, some man gave him two cats. [[01:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=4339.66s)]
*  William Seward right there. [[01:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=4342.54s)]

*  He's real cat boy. [[01:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=4348.46s)]

*  Yeah. [[01:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=4352.62s)]
*  And they, one, one cool thing it's really neat about Springfield, bring it up if [[01:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=4352.9s)]
*  you can, Nick, they have like the whole neighborhood, they turned into a museum. [[01:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=4355.66s)]
*  So you can go to his neighbor's house. [[01:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=4360.94s)]
*  You can go down the street and it's really cool. [[01:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=4362.74s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=4365.66s)]
*  Like you literally feel like you're in the past. [[01:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=4365.82s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=4367.94s)]
*  I, um, so he also on the same subject of him and animals, he was, he killed a [[01:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=4368.7s)]
*  turkey when he was like 12 years old. [[01:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=4375.74s)]
*  He shot it from his cabin in Kentucky and goblers. [[01:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=4378.14s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=4380.58s)]
*  And he, he went out and he saw it and it's, it's final suffering. [[01:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=4381.0599999999995s)]
*  And he vowed that he would never kill an animal again. [[01:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=4387.34s)]
*  He was probably the only person in his generation that when, if his wagon was [[01:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=4391.98s)]
*  going down the road and it was going to run over his snake, he'd stop and get out [[01:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=4396.139999999999s)]
*  and pick the snake up and move it. [[01:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=4400.179999999999s)]
*  He was, you know, which is ironic because, you know, he, he had a, he ran a war that [[01:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=4402.78s)]
*  killed 659,000 people, but Grant Ulysses Grant, who did a lot of the killing, you [[01:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=4409.42s)]
*  know, hand to hand, he had the same thing. [[01:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=4417.26s)]
*  He never lost his temper. [[01:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=4420.58s)]
*  The only time that he was ever seen to lose his temper was when he saw [[01:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=4422.14s)]
*  a man beating a horse. [[01:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=4425.58s)]
*  Some real animal lovers, you know, hooker, there was a sergeant, Colonel Hooker. [[01:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=4428.26s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=4431.82s)]
*  Oh, general, general Hooker. [[01:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=4432.3s)]
*  That's how they got the term hookers because he brought ladies in to spend [[01:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=4433.78s)]
*  time with his troops. [[01:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=4437.82s)]
*  You know, a lot of history of interesting history. [[01:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=4438.66s)]
*  I don't know about that, but that's, I know about hookers, buddy. [[01:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=4442.18s)]
*  I mean, unfortunately, but I do know that civil war. [[01:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=4444.9s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=4451.98s)]
*  They brought in hookers first, but, um, American civil war, he was properly with [[01:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=4452.34s)]
*  his men because he didn't crack the whip. [[01:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=4457.0599999999995s)]
*  Um, in terms of discipline, it said, uh, after a hard day on the battlefield, he [[01:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=4459.74s)]
*  would bring in prostitutes, but they eventually, a lot of his men got diseases [[01:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=4466.5s)]
*  from unprotected sex and killed a lot of them anyway. [[01:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=4471.3s)]
*  Moving on. [[01:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=4475.3s)]
*  I was saying about Lincoln. [[01:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=4476.26s)]
*  Lincoln said, he was asked, how do you, um, what would you do if you had to cut [[01:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=4477.58s)]
*  down a, like a really big oak tree and you had five hours to do it? [[01:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=4483.06s)]
*  He said, I'd spend four hours sharpening the ax, which is good. [[01:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=4487.42s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=4491.46s)]
*  Is it, it's like, it's, um, it's a metaphor for, you know, keeping yourself in [[01:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=4491.98s)]
*  kind of a good spiritual space, you know, that you've, it's, you're more efficient [[01:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=4496.82s)]
*  and more effective you expend less energy. [[01:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=4502.259999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=4505.339999999999s)]
*  Yeah, man. [[01:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=4506.299999999999s)]
*  I've definitely, that's been a, probably a struggle for me this year is trying to [[01:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=4506.7s)]
*  do too much, getting frenetic and then acting. [[01:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=4512.62s)]
*  I'm getting a little better. [[01:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=4517.0199999999995s)]
*  I'm getting better at it, but acting from a place of like frenetic, you know, [[01:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=4517.98s)]
*  it's just, man, sometimes it just gets tough. [[01:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=4522.9s)]
*  It's tough, you know, but every time I slow it down, every time I kind of do my [[01:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=4524.7s)]
*  morning routine well and do my practices, everything's way different. [[01:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=4528.94s)]
*  Um, what was, what was one thing that sobriety, we're both sober. [[01:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=4532.339999999999s)]
*  So what was one thing that sobriety kind of adjusted or changed in your, for you [[01:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=4536.66s)]
*  and your life that you didn't expect maybe, what was something that came out of it? [[01:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=4541.0599999999995s)]
*  Or being a part of it or around it? [[01:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=4545.54s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=4548.62s)]
*  Well, you changed everything in my life because I think before I came in, I was [[01:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=4549.82s)]
*  just like a bundle of appetites, you know, and that's when you're, you're kind of [[01:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=4554.0599999999995s)]
*  living, uh, according to self will. [[01:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=4558.9s)]
*  And, you know, it's like, whether it's, you know, drugs or alcohol or sex or [[01:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=4562.98s)]
*  extreme behavior or just, you know, I was always just filling that empty hole [[01:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=4567.62s)]
*  inside of me with, with things of trying to fix that by reaching for things [[01:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=4574.7s)]
*  outside of myself and my mind is like a formulation pharmacy, I can turn [[01:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=4580.139999999999s)]
*  anything into a drug and, um, you know, uh, and then, um, and then trying to [[01:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=4584.42s)]
*  adjust your compass so that you're, you know, you're not living for self will, [[01:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=4595.34s)]
*  but you're trying to, um, do the next right thing and, and, you know, be of [[01:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=4600.66s)]
*  service to others, um, and that, you know, that, that is what, you know, when I, I [[01:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=4605.94s)]
*  was, when I, I, I feel like I was born an addict. [[01:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=4613.42s)]
*  I feel like I had just an empty hole inside of me from when I was a little kid. [[01:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=4617.0199999999995s)]
*  You don't think, so you don't think it was something really that caused it when [[01:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=4621.82s)]
*  you look at it? [[01:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=4623.94s)]
*  I don't think so, but you know, and you hear in the program all the time, like [[01:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=4624.22s)]
*  half the people think they were born with it and others think that, you know, [[01:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=4628.26s)]
*  trauma, you know, had something to do with it. [[01:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=4633.02s)]
*  But I, you know, I also, I, I, there's certain races like the Irish that are, [[01:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=4635.7s)]

*  It was like, I left out of there with like, I don't know. [[01:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=4738.98s)]
*  It just, people sharing makes you feel more connected, you know? [[01:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=4742.139999999999s)]
*  Um, [[01:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=4745.66s)]
*  but you know, when you, uh, when you got sober, did you realize, did you, [[01:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=4745.86s)]
*  because a lot of, I know a lot of comics feel like, you know, that the alcohol [[01:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=4750.74s)]
*  and the drugs are part of what makes them funny, did you, and that they have [[01:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=4756.66s)]
*  any anxiety about getting sober because they think it might hurt. [[01:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=4760.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=4764.98s)]
*  I think I had some of that for sure. [[01:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=4765.22s)]
*  You know, I was in and out for a long time. [[01:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=4767.58s)]
*  I had three years sober and then I was in and out. [[01:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=4769.54s)]
*  And then finally I just was so spiritually just empty. [[01:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=4771.58s)]
*  You know, I'd gotten a decent amount of popularity and I thought that that would [[01:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=4776.7s)]
*  achieve my happiness or it would do something for me and it just didn't do anything. [[01:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=4780.02s)]
*  It was like literally getting to a top of a mountain and, or, you know, a decent [[01:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=4785.34s)]
*  ledge on a mountain and you're like, dang, I'm still on a mountain, you know? [[01:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=4788.82s)]
*  That's what it felt like. [[01:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=4794.22s)]
*  And so I think that just made me realize that there was something bigger going on [[01:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=4794.94s)]
*  inside of me that I had to get some help for. [[01:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=4798.5s)]
*  Um, and then just the gifts of it, like seeing other people get well, like [[01:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=4800.74s)]
*  seeing people's lives turn around, like just it's, it's cool. [[01:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=4805.9s)]
*  I can go to a place every day. [[01:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=4810.38s)]
*  I can go somewhere and witness a miracle almost. [[01:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=4811.86s)]
*  And that's unbelievable. [[01:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=4813.82s)]
*  You know, people are looking for miracles and reasons to make them feel, you know? [[01:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=4815.78s)]
*  And so I think that's one of the reasons I go to is because there, it makes me [[01:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=4819.62s)]
*  feel in there, you know, like regular life, it was always trying to find [[01:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=4822.78s)]
*  something to make me feel, and I could never, I couldn't do it. [[01:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=4826.66s)]
*  There wasn't anything that was doing it enough, but man, I go in there and I see [[01:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=4830.58s)]
*  somebody who their life has changed and man, it makes me feel, you know? [[01:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=4834.7s)]
*  And that's really what I've always been looking for. [[01:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=4839.9s)]
*  I've just been wanting to feel. [[01:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=4841.54s)]
*  And that's probably one of the most blessings of it. [[01:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=4843.34s)]
*  And then just getting to meet cool. [[01:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=4846.18s)]
*  I mean, like, you know, you and our friends, I have so many, most [[01:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=4847.26s)]
*  of my friends are sober. [[01:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=4850.54s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=4852.34s)]
*  You know, it's kind of crazy. [[01:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=4852.66s)]
*  It's just how it kind of works out. [[01:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=4853.58s)]
*  And also some of them used to be the biggest derelict. [[01:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=4855.34s)]
*  So you get to hang out with the craziest people in the world, you know? [[01:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=4857.66s)]
*  I mean, alcoholics are generally kind of desperate. [[01:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=4861.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=4865.1s)]
*  Oh, they're interesting. [[01:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=4866.1s)]
*  Well, you feel like a desperado in this campaign. [[01:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=4867.740000000001s)]
*  I mean, one thing that I've, that I thought about was interesting about you is that [[01:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=4869.700000000001s)]
*  nobody was in your pocket because nobody was getting on board with you. [[01:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=4873.06s)]
*  It, you know, you like, yeah, it seemed like there's no choice. [[01:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=4877.22s)]
*  Like there's nothing that's like, this is who we, this is, this guy is what he is. [[01:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=4881.38s)]
*  Whether you, he's not working for anybody. [[01:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=4886.14s)]
*  That's what it always was like. [[01:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=4888.62s)]
*  That's the most admirable thing to me about anything in these days is like, I [[01:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=4890.02s)]
*  just want somebody who's not part of the status quo, cause the status quo feels [[01:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=4893.860000000001s)]
*  very dangerous or the system feels dangerous, you know? [[01:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=4898.9400000000005s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=4902.660000000001s)]
*  Does that make sense or not? [[01:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=4903.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=4904.780000000001s)]
*  And I, you know, it's, I don't know. [[01:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=4905.22s)]
*  I think, you know, my campaign, the way it came together, it feels, I don't know. [[01:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=4907.14s)]
*  It just feels like, um, uh, there's some, you know, there, all the people are [[01:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=4912.5s)]
*  involved in it are people who are, you know, on some kind of a spiritual quest, [[01:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=4920.780000000001s)]
*  you know, and it's, it's really interesting because they came from all, you know, [[01:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=4926.900000000001s)]
*  different, but you know, there was an early on in my campaign, we didn't have any [[01:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=4932.58s)]
*  money because most people who join, who started campaign are there as senators, [[01:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=4938.78s)]
*  governors, they've been in politics before. [[01:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=4943.62s)]
*  So they have an email list and they have a huge war chest. [[01:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=4946.42s)]
*  They come in with 20 or $30 million and you're not allowed to raise any money [[01:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=4950.62s)]
*  till you register with the FEC, with federal election commission. [[01:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=4955.06s)]
*  So, you know, so you, and now I announced my campaign. [[01:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=4958.1s)]
*  And I have no money in the bank. [[01:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=4963.14s)]
*  So no, you know, let's say I get 5,000 calls the next day. [[01:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=4964.5s)]
*  I want to help you. [[01:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=4967.62s)]
*  I got nobody answer the phone. [[01:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=4968.46s)]
*  I don't have a phone because I'm not allowed to spend money until I register. [[01:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=4970.86s)]
*  And so we were really desperate for money at the outset and a guy said, um, [[01:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=4977.58s)]
*  contacted me and said through a friend and said, you know, I want to, I can get [[01:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=4983.42s)]
*  $10 million for you fast. [[01:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=4988.42s)]
*  And I met him in my hotel. [[01:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=4990.78s)]
*  And I was like one of those consolidation credit card things. [[01:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=4995.38s)]
*  No, it was just a guy who, you know, he was an attorney who had a lot of clients [[01:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=5000.38s)]
*  who were private deal in industries. [[01:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=5005.82s)]
*  And he said, um, who would, who would give me money? [[01:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=5009.42s)]
*  But they were industries that I really didn't want to take money from. [[01:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=5013.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=5017.0599999999995s)]
*  And I, um, and so, and he left and I just didn't, it just didn't feel, it felt [[01:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=5017.94s)]
*  like it just didn't feel right. [[01:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=5026.099999999999s)]
*  And so I called the guy who had brought him in and I just said, I can't do it. [[01:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=5027.7s)]
*  And I immediately felt like, yeah, that was the right decision. [[01:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=5033.5s)]
*  And you know, if we're supposed to win, we'll win, but you know, whatever happens, [[01:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=5037.339999999999s)]
*  um, at the end of this process, I'm going to have my integrity intact. [[01:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=5042.299999999999s)]
*  And that's the only thing that really matters. [[01:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=5046.139999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=5048.179999999999s)]
*  Wow. [[01:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=5049.54s)]
*  That's cool, man. [[01:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=5049.78s)]
*  Your wife seems so proud of you. [[01:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=5050.94s)]
*  I saw you on tiger belly. [[01:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=5052.099999999999s)]
*  I felt like she seems, she seems so proud of you. [[01:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=5053.66s)]
*  That's it. [[01:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=5055.5s)]
*  Seemed pretty, that was wild. [[01:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=5055.86s)]
*  That show. [[01:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=5057.0199999999995s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=5057.66s)]
*  I thought I first, when I was all there, I was like, wow, this is a different world. [[01:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=5057.86s)]
*  But I think, yeah, that were you, have you been on the show? [[01:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=5060.9s)]
*  But I've been on the show before. [[01:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=5064.0599999999995s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=5065.099999999999s)]
*  And what did you think of it? [[01:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=5065.82s)]
*  It's bonkers in there, you know, it's like, uh, but it's just this love very high [[01:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=5066.98s)]
*  energy, but he's so, he's such a sweet. [[01:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=5071.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=5074.54s)]

*  And he's, um, what is he like? [[01:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=5078.219999999999s)]
*  He's had a kind of a wild life, you know, he's had an interesting life and, but [[01:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=5081.099999999999s)]

*  And I think part of his podcast is just being in his world and what it's like, [[01:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=5087.099999999999s)]
*  you know, so I thought it was brave for you to go, but I also thought that it was [[01:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=5090.54s)]
*  cool, you know, when you got to see you and your wife and I just felt like, man, [[01:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=5092.82s)]
*  I could tell your wife just seemed real proud of you. [[01:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=5096.339999999999s)]
*  Maybe she's also just a good actress, but she seems to love me, but you know, I [[01:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=5098.5s)]
*  have to keep saying she's an actress. [[01:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=5104.58s)]
*  How do I know? [[01:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=5106.22s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=5108.9s)]
*  One day she could just say, and scene. [[01:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=5109.18s)]
*  Um, there was recently, there was like a, you guys had a, uh, you guys had an [[01:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=5113.0199999999995s)]
*  issue with the security, right? [[01:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=5116.98s)]
*  That that happened. [[01:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=5119.1s)]
*  This is a few days ago, maybe where they had a guy who was like, it looked like [[01:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=5119.94s)]
*  he was, uh, here we go. [[01:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=5124.78s)]
*  Armed man arrested at RFK junior campaign event in Los Angeles. [[01:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=5126.14s)]
*  Was this guy armed and supportive of you or was he armed and it seemed like he [[01:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=5129.98s)]

*  Yeah. [[01:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=5591.9400000000005s)]
*  Because you think you'd be able to hit them up and be like, Joey, you know, [[01:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=5592.1s)]
*  trade you an ice cream for a couple of front door goons, you know, a couple [[01:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=5595.860000000001s)]

*  I mean, you know, I think every man loves to have a dessert. [[01:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=5607.46s)]
*  Um, do you think that Donald Trump will legally be allowed to run in the election? [[01:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=5610.74s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=5616.38s)]
*  I don't think that can stop him from running, even if he was in jail. [[01:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=5616.74s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=5619.58s)]
*  He's still entitled to run because there's only, you know, the, the [[01:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=5620.860000000001s)]
*  constitution, uh, the constitution says there's only three things that you [[01:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=5624.14s)]
*  got to do to be, you have to be a citizen. [[01:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=5629.58s)]
*  You have to be born here and you have to be over 35 years of age. [[01:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=5632.26s)]
*  Okay. [[01:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=5635.38s)]
*  And that's it. [[01:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=5636.82s)]
*  You can be a president. [[01:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=5637.74s)]
*  There's no, there's no way to block somebody because they got convicted. [[01:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=5638.860000000001s)]
*  Uh, you know, it's in the constitution, what the criteria is for being president. [[01:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=5642.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=5647.14s)]
*  It's funny because I feel like some people like Trump because they, he [[01:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=5648.3s)]
*  just wasn't a politician, you know, he could have been anybody. [[01:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=5652.22s)]
*  He could have been a fraggle. [[01:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=5654.82s)]
*  He could have been a, uh, mime. [[01:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=5656.22s)]
*  I think some people just want anything that's not, they just, something has to change. [[01:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=5658.98s)]
*  They feel like at the very least I'll vote for something that's not a politician. [[01:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=5663.86s)]
*  I just feel like people start to feel like this, the overall system is so corrupt. [[01:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=5669.26s)]
*  You know? [[01:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=5673.18s)]
*  Um, and. [[01:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=5673.9s)]
*  I think that's something that's been kind of harrowing just to voters overall. [[01:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=5676.22s)]
*  Um, well, you know, people are, people are suffering in this country now. [[01:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=5680.1s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=5686.58s)]
*  We're not, you know, like I said before, when, you know, with housing, [[01:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=5686.9800000000005s)]
*  our kids are not going to get, you know, the American promise, the American dream [[01:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=5692.18s)]
*  was that this promise that if you worked hard, you play by the rules, you can [[01:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=5696.1s)]
*  afford a house, you could have a summer vacation, you could take care of your [[01:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=5701.42s)]
*  family and you could put money aside for retirement with one job. [[01:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=5705.9800000000005s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=5710.9s)]
*  And there, you know, my kids, you know, I have seven kids, you know, six of them [[01:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=5711.54s)]
*  are in that 2030 range and not, none of them and none of their friends are [[01:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=5717.1s)]
*  looking for a house because it's so out of reach and, um, you know, you have a [[01:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=5721.46s)]
*  generation of kids who now are struggling with the, with college debts that are, [[01:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=5727.3s)]
*  what they've been for college is seven times what I paid. [[01:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=5732.42s)]
*  They're never going to pay off that college debt and they're never going to [[01:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=5736.1s)]
*  own a home for most of these kids. [[01:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=5739.38s)]
*  And it's like, like, you know, the American dream is gone. [[01:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=5741.5s)]
*  Right. [[01:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=5744.700000000001s)]
*  And so then what is it? [[01:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=5744.9400000000005s)]
*  If you don't have an American dream, then what do you have? [[01:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=5745.860000000001s)]
*  You know, that's one of the reasons that people are so angry at both [[01:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=5748.42s)]
*  Republicans and Democrats because there's a level of disintegration in this country [[01:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=5754.22s)]
*  and deterioration. [[01:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=5759.820000000001s)]
*  I mean, I, you know, I do, I end up talking to a lot of people because of my job. [[01:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=5760.66s)]
*  You know, I represent a thousand families in Colombiana County, Ohio for the [[01:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=5767.26s)]
*  Norfolk Southern Spill. [[01:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=5772.3s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[01:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=5773.740000000001s)]
*  Um, and, and, you know, all of these environmental cases, I end up talking to [[01:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=5774.5s)]
*  people at every level of society. [[01:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=5779.18s)]
*  And I see the desperation that people are living in. [[01:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=5781.14s)]
*  It's like, you know, elderly people now are splitting their prescriptions, their [[01:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=5784.34s)]
*  drug prescriptions, cutting pills in two to make them stretch out the, the [[01:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=5789.3s)]
*  week so they can buy food. [[01:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=5794.18s)]

*  You have to wonder whether the baby is $50 sick or a hundred dollars sick or [[01:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=5799.14s)]
*  $1,500 sick before they bring them to a hospital. [[01:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=5803.62s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=5806.5s)]
*  There's people your age and my kid's age who, um, who are choosing between [[01:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=5807.0199999999995s)]
*  gasoline and food. [[01:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=5813.74s)]
*  And, uh, you know, there it's a 57% of the people in this country cannot put [[01:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=5816.0199999999995s)]
*  their hands on a thousand dollars if they have an emergency or somebody like that. [[01:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=5821.78s)]
*  If the engine light goes on in the car, it's the apocalypse. [[01:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=5827.299999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=5830.82s)]
*  Cause they know they know they can't afford that mechanic. [[01:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=5831.099999999999s)]
*  They know, okay, now I can't get to work. [[01:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=5835.1s)]
*  I'm going to lose my job. [[01:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=5838.900000000001s)]
*  Then I'm going to lose my house. [[01:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=5840.18s)]
*  And then I'm going to be like all those people in San Francisco who were just [[01:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=5841.620000000001s)]

*  The engine light went on their car and they couldn't find the mechanic. [[01:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=5855.22s)]
*  That's what I feel like I played the engine lights on in this country. [[01:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=5858.42s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=5860.54s)]

*  Put two kids in the back of your car, you know, a toddler in a baby seat and [[01:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=5880.38s)]
*  another kid, and you're now magnifying that anxiety and now you're driving [[01:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=5884.339999999999s)]

*  things that, well, that's what it's like living paycheck to paycheck. [[01:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=5893.54s)]
*  And that's what Americans are doing. [[01:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=5896.62s)]
*  And, uh, it's like most Americans wake up every day and with that sense [[01:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=5898.179999999999s)]

*  They don't know what's going to happen. [[01:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=5909.259999999999s)]
*  And they're desperate and they, and nobody is listening to them. [[01:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=5910.86s)]
*  The politicians aren't listening to them for the Republican or the Democrats. [[01:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=5915.259999999999s)]
*  And Donald Trump comes along and says, I'm going to break things and, uh, and [[01:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=5918.58s)]
*  they love him and I get it, you know, and the Democrats can't understand [[01:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=5923.18s)]
*  why are all these people liking Donald Trump? [[01:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=5927.1s)]
*  That's the reason. [[01:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=5929.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=5930.38s)]
*  Cause you're not listening to them. [[01:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=5930.82s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=5932.82s)]
*  I think, and people want anything. [[01:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=5933.22s)]
*  I'd have voted for, I'd vote for a literally a puppet. [[01:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=5934.62s)]
*  I'd vote for Grover. [[01:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=5937.86s)]
*  I'd vote for anything that wasn't a poll, you know, that wasn't a career [[01:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=5939.0599999999995s)]
*  politician because I'm just so over it. [[01:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=5943.18s)]
*  And you see these shows like painkiller and like, um, that one on Hulu too. [[01:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=5945.42s)]
*  The one that I can't remember. [[01:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=5950.22s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=5951.62s)]
*  Well, what is it called? [[01:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=5951.82s)]
*  Uh, uh, the one about the Sacklers. [[01:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=5952.62s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=5955.14s)]

*  At Pharma. [[01:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=5955.78s)]
*  If that show didn't ruin your faith in taking care of people in this country, [[01:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=5957.34s)]
*  it's unfucking real, man. [[01:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=5963.34s)]
*  I hate to use that language, but it made me so mad, bro. [[01:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=5965.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=5968.86s)]
*  It just made me so mad how compromised we are now, how it feels, you know, [[01:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=5969.1s)]
*  because if we're not even out here caring about each other, then what do we even [[01:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=5973.9s)]
*  doing, you know, that's what it starts to feel like. [[01:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=5976.5s)]
*  It's like, if we're not out here trying to do something like, then what do we do? [[01:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=5979.339999999999s)]
*  We're just then what, you know, I'm just out here to have a nice car. [[01:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=5983.86s)]
*  It just, I don't know, man. [[01:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=5987.7s)]
*  It's about, is it about, we're just here to make a big pile for ourselves [[01:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=5988.7s)]
*  and whoever dies with the most stuff wins. [[01:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=5994.58s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=5996.66s)]
*  But we are proven that there's no value in it. [[01:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=5996.86s)]
*  It's like, it's been proven over and over again. [[01:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=5999.46s)]
*  When you, uh, when you come across people like that, right? [[01:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=6001.5s)]
*  On your campaign trail and you like, what do you offer them? [[01:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=6005.46s)]
*  What type of hope do you offer them? [[01:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=6009.62s)]
*  Well, you know, I think that's why I have, because I mean, I have specific [[01:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=6011.26s)]
*  things that I'm going to do to make, I, well, I mean, like with housing, [[01:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=6016.82s)]
*  what I, one of the things I'm going to do is I'm going to make, I mean, [[01:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=6020.7s)]
*  I'm going to make a, I'm going to make a, I'm going to make a, I'm going to make a [[01:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=6025.7s)]
*  I'm going to make a 3% mortgage available to every American for a single family home. [[01:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=6030.42s)]
*  Oh, if you, right now, you know, you're going to pay seven or eight or 10. [[01:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=6036.7s)]
*  I'm going to cut that down. [[01:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=6042.9800000000005s)]
*  So your mortgage for the average home, 215,000 or $400,000 a month, [[01:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=6045.02s)]
*  which people can afford. [[01:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=6051.3s)]
*  And it's going to allow you to compete and your kids to compete with BlackRock. [[01:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=6052.26s)]
*  I'm going to change the tax code to make it more difficult for them to, you know, [[01:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=6057.58s)]
*  to, to buy up all the single family homes, which is not good for democracy, [[01:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=6061.94s)]
*  not good for our country. [[01:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=6065.9s)]
*  You know, if you have a rich uncle, you can get a, who will co-sign your mortgage. [[01:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=6068.099999999999s)]
*  You can get a much cheaper mortgage rate because the bank is looking at his credit [[01:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=6075.66s)]
*  rating, you know, his perfect credit rating rather than your... [[01:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=6080.46s)]
*  So it's like an appetism kind of. [[01:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=6083.82s)]
*  Oh, you know, and what I'm going to do is I'm going to give everybody a rich uncle, [[01:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=6085.860000000001s)]
*  which is Uncle Sam. [[01:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=6090.34s)]
*  I'm going to get the U.S. [[01:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=6091.860000000001s)]
*  government to co-sign your mortgage. [[01:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=6093.860000000001s)]
*  Now, if you default and the government owns your house, no foul, no loss, but it's [[01:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=6095.38s)]
*  going to allow you to stay in that house. [[01:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=6101.820000000001s)]
*  And, you know, I'm going to give the first half, no 500,000 to teachers, because we [[01:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=6104.1s)]
*  need to start supporting the teachers in this country, but to make them available to [[01:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=6108.14s)]
*  all Americans who want a single family home, because we need widespread home ownership. [[01:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=6111.66s)]
*  Thomas Jefferson said American democracy can only survive if it's based on tens of [[01:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=6117.18s)]
*  thousands of independent freeholds owned by individual Americans and, you know, not [[01:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=6124.38s)]
*  big corporations. [[01:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=6129.099999999999s)]
*  The aristocratic, the feudal model where the billionaires own the landscapes and we [[01:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=6130.34s)]
*  all are, you know, we were no longer citizens. [[01:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=6136.14s)]
*  We're now, you know, we're now subjects or not. [[01:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=6138.46s)]
*  You know, we're serfs on our own country. [[01:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=6142.82s)]
*  Yeah, that's what it feels like. [[01:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=6145.42s)]
*  It feels like we're subjects and the Lord don't even tell us who they are. [[01:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=6146.3s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[01:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=6148.78s)]
*  That's the sickest part. [[01:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=6149.9800000000005s)]
*  At least show your fucking face, you know, at least let me know who's, you know, it's [[01:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=6151.22s)]
*  like that's what it feels like a lot of times. [[01:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=6155.94s)]
*  I know you went and visited the border. [[01:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=6159.02s)]
*  We had a border patrol security. [[01:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=6160.14s)]
*  We had a gentleman on here who was the head of the border patrol. [[01:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=6162.78s)]
*  Chris Clem. [[01:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=6166.18s)]
*  No, this guy had retired Roy Villarreal. [[01:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=6167.179999999999s)]
*  OK, he came on here. [[01:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=6170.379999999999s)]
*  This is two years ago and he was talking about one of the biggest issues that he was [[01:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=6171.66s)]
*  noticing at the border. [[01:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=6174.82s)]
*  This was in Arizona. [[01:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=6176.179999999999s)]
*  That was his jurisdiction was that they were people were getting the the the [[01:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=6177.0599999999995s)]
*  legislative branches weren't working well. [[01:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=6182.419999999999s)]
*  So like they would arrest people, but they weren't prosecuting them. [[01:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=6184.179999999999s)]
*  So they would get just the same people back over and over again. [[01:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=6187.099999999999s)]
*  So it seemed like such a goose chase. [[01:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=6190.139999999999s)]
*  Well, it's gotten 100 times worse now. [[01:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=6192.5s)]
*  Wow. [[01:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=6194.66s)]
*  Because now that people are just I mean, I was there between two and four a.m. [[01:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=6195.14s)]
*  in the morning. [[01:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=6200.900000000001s)]
*  I watched 300 people just walk across and the border patrol brings them to the airport [[01:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=6201.5s)]
*  and, you know, they brought a fingerprint. [[01:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=6206.06s)]
*  And if they're criminal, then they go into a different line. [[01:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=6208.42s)]
*  But the rest of them are brought to the Yuma airport, given a ticket to any place they [[01:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=6211.3s)]
*  want to go in the United States. [[01:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=6219.700000000001s)]
*  And then we pay for it if they don't have the money for it. [[01:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=6221.1s)]
*  And, you know, they've 110,000 landed in New York and this is a humanitarian crisis. [[01:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=6223.7s)]
*  I talked to the people who were coming over. [[01:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=6228.3s)]
*  They've been exploited, extorted, beaten. [[01:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=6231.58s)]
*  What's what's happened is the whole thing's run by the Mexican drug cartel. [[01:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=6233.7s)]
*  We saw the buses. [[01:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=6237.5s)]
*  They have white buses, the cartel on 55 people a bus. [[01:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=6239.1s)]
*  They pick them up in Mexicali and they bring them to the border and they let them out. [[01:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=6243.38s)]
*  The people who come out are from every country. [[01:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=6248.18s)]
*  They're not. [[01:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=6250.78s)]
*  You know, they're from all over. [[01:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=6251.74s)]
*  And they have to pay the cartels from Asia. [[01:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=6253.299999999999s)]
*  Right. [[01:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=6255.5s)]
*  They have to pay the cartels to get through their land. [[01:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=6256.099999999999s)]
*  Well, right. [[01:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=6258.66s)]
*  But they pay them usually upfront, 10 to $15,000 to get them across the United States. [[01:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=6260.46s)]
*  And the cartels are advertising all over the world and they're advertising on YouTube. [[01:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=6266.0199999999995s)]
*  They're telling you exactly what's going to happen to you. [[01:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=6272.42s)]
*  They come across and then what happens is they're given by the border patrol, the [[01:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=6276.179999999999s)]
*  nine border patrol committed suicide because what they're being asked to do is not their job. [[01:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=6280.860000000001s)]
*  They're just escorting people. [[01:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=6285.9800000000005s)]
*  Seven million people have come across illegally in three years and legal immigration [[01:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=6288.46s)]
*  during that period was three point one million. [[01:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=6293.900000000001s)]
*  So the cartels are literally controlling our immigration policy. [[01:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=6295.74s)]
*  And we have a video that I made, you know, an 18 minute video that shows what happened. [[01:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=6299.46s)]
*  But you were only down there for what? [[01:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=6306.9400000000005s)]
*  How long were you down there for? [[01:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=6308.62s)]
*  I was there for three days. [[01:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=6309.5s)]
*  OK. [[01:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=6311.1s)]
*  And then, you know, and then we've been dealing, you know, we made the film, we, you know, [[01:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=6311.54s)]
*  I've been writing a lot about it, researching it, and it can totally be shut down overnight. [[01:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=6316.46s)]
*  They're not. And what happens is people think, well, there's all those people. [[01:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=6322.9800000000005s)]
*  But I just wonder, is that a long enough, like, time to go see it? [[01:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=6329.7s)]
*  Like three days? Is that a real? [[01:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=6332.74s)]
*  I had three intense days of first of all, the first night watching all these people come [[01:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=6334.1s)]
*  and then spending the next days with local law enforcement, local sheriff's department, [[01:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=6338.78s)]
*  the ice, the border patrol, all the local medical systems, the doctors and doing, you know, [[01:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=6343.5s)]
*  you know, an interview. [[01:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=6349.82s)]
*  No, it's good to talk with those people. [[01:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=6350.66s)]
*  That's why we wanted the guy because we kept hearing the border. [[01:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=6351.9s)]
*  But it gets it gets like becomes like this political like red rover that that [[01:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=6354.219999999999s)]
*  different parties use. And you never know what's going on. [[01:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=6358.86s)]
*  That's why we wanted a border patrol agent until we could see what happens. [[01:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=6361.179999999999s)]
*  There's a guy called Chris Clem, who was the head of the border patrol. [[01:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=6364.58s)]
*  And Yuma. And he's fantastic and he's giving us advice. [[01:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=6367.86s)]
*  But, you know, what happens is a lot of the Democrats think, oh, we're being kind to these [[01:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=6373.139999999999s)]
*  people by letting them in, but we're not. [[01:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=6377.86s)]
*  In fact, what happens is they're given a court date for seven years in the future to go to the [[01:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=6379.9s)]
*  asylum court. So they have seven years in this country where they have no legal status. [[01:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=6385.42s)]
*  So they're not allowed to work. [[01:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=6393.0599999999995s)]
*  So they they work for five or six. [[01:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=6394.9s)]
*  You know, you have unscrupulous employers from five or six bucks an hour. [[01:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=6398.18s)]
*  And then, you know, they're employed on construction sites in New York. [[01:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=6401.98s)]
*  The employer, the construction company that's employing them is competing for bids [[01:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=6406.94s)]
*  against a union labor company. [[01:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=6412.0199999999995s)]
*  And he knew that because he's been six bucks an hour. [[01:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=6414.3s)]
*  Right. So but just but just as guilty as the as the people who are undermining the [[01:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=6418.34s)]
*  system, right, as they are of undermining the system, people can have their own like [[01:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=6423.5s)]
*  social beliefs about it. But there is guilt of undermining what the system is that's in [[01:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=6429.1s)]
*  place. But those the people that pay them to work are also guilty. [[01:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=6433.9s)]
*  Right. If they're. [[01:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=6437.86s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, I you know, here's what I would do. [[01:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=6439.66s)]
*  And first of all, you need you need to hire a thousand asylum judges and you need to [[01:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=6444.02s)]
*  adjudicate before people come in. [[01:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=6449.26s)]
*  Once they come in, they're entitled to stay here. [[01:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=6450.82s)]
*  They get a court date. [[01:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=6453.219999999999s)]
*  Put them out on the border like Judge you. [[01:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=6454.66s)]
*  Exactly. And they adjudicate right there. [[01:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=6456.259999999999s)]
*  And and and then it will shut down the border. [[01:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=6458.9s)]
*  And most of the people, 99 percent of people we interviewed didn't even have an asylum [[01:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=6461.9s)]
*  claim. They just said, I'm here to work. [[01:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=6465.94s)]
*  Right. I want a job. Right. [[01:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=6467.74s)]
*  And so they you know, they are not entitled. [[01:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=6468.98s)]
*  They have to come through the regular line like everybody else legally. [[01:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=6471.3s)]
*  Yeah, that's what's fair is just doing it legally because you can't keep if you don't [[01:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=6474.9s)]
*  have accounting in inventory of your business, then you're bound to go. [[01:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=6477.94s)]
*  Yeah. You know, I'll tell you how you shut it down overnight. [[01:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=6481.9s)]
*  And this is what I'm going to do the day I get into office. [[01:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=6486.419999999999s)]
*  I'm going to waive passport fees for all any American who can't afford it. [[01:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=6489.9s)]
*  What that means is if you can get a passport card, I don't know if you've seen it. [[01:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=6495.419999999999s)]
*  I got it. It looks like a license. [[01:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=6499.54s)]
*  Right. It's a federal ID with your picture on it. [[01:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=6501.339999999999s)]
*  And the problem is it costs sixty five dollars and there's some paperwork attached [[01:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=6504.7s)]
*  that makes it difficult for very poor people to get them. [[01:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=6510.42s)]
*  And so there's a lot of people in our country who are poor, particularly in cities [[01:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=6514.78s)]
*  who don't drive cars, they don't have a driver's license, they have no government [[01:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=6519.74s)]
*  issued ID. Now, if you don't have a government issued ID, you're a second class [[01:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=6523.0599999999995s)]
*  citizen. You cannot open a bank account, which means you're using, you know, the [[01:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=6528.22s)]
*  paycheck companies that take 10 percent of your Social Security check, the cashier [[01:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=6533.1s)]
*  check. You can't get on an airplane. [[01:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=6538.9s)]
*  You can't stay at a hotel. You can't visit your kids at school. [[01:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=6542.86s)]
*  And so what I'm going to do, there's thirty three thousand post offices in this [[01:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=6546.54s)]
*  country. I'm going to make it very easy for any American citizen who can't afford [[01:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=6551.38s)]
*  it to go down to the local post office and get a passport ID. [[01:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=6555.62s)]
*  Once they do that, you now tell employers you cannot hire somebody unless they have [[01:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=6559.94s)]
*  that passport ID. [[01:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=6565.46s)]
*  I will shut down the border overnight because nobody's going to come through if [[01:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=6567.179999999999s)]
*  they know they cannot get a job, because now you're now you can prosecute employers [[01:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=6570.74s)]
*  right now. What they do, the employer construction firm in New York, they're [[01:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=6575.219999999999s)]
*  just they don't care if you're legal or illegal. [[01:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=6580.0199999999995s)]
*  They just want somebody who's cheap as possible and that they can check the box. [[01:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=6583.259999999999s)]
*  So they ask for Social Security, the Social Security card has no picture on it. [[01:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=6587.7s)]
*  They're easily fabricated and they're handed, you know, passed down from person to [[01:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=6592.9s)]
*  person. Oh, yeah, those things are nuts. [[01:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=6597.219999999999s)]
*  Right. And so you can't put the employer in jail because he says, hey, I got a [[01:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=6599.299999999999s)]
*  Social Security card. But now you're telling the employer, the employer, it's [[01:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=6605.139999999999s)]
*  illegal for the employer to do it. [[01:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=6609.0599999999995s)]
*  Right. And now you're saying you got to have a passport card where you're going to [[01:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=6611.099999999999s)]
*  jail. OK. [[01:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=6613.74s)]
*  At that point, all illegal employment dries up overnight. [[01:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=6614.82s)]
*  Nobody is going to employ somebody with the risk of going to prison. [[01:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=6620.06s)]
*  And but and one other thing it'll do is that it will solve a lot of the anxieties [[01:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=6624.02s)]
*  that people have, Republicans particularly, about voting, because they say, oh, you [[01:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=6631.38s)]
*  know, these people are coming in and they're voting. [[01:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=6636.42s)]
*  People are voting without ID and they're double voting. [[01:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=6638.78s)]
*  They're committing voting fraud. [[01:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=6641.62s)]
*  Well, now everybody has an ID and you can't have any of that kind of voting [[01:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=6642.82s)]
*  fraud. And and the Democrats support it. [[01:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=6646.179999999999s)]
*  I mean, the Democrats will support it, although Biden won't sign this bill. [[01:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=6650.42s)]
*  But but, you know, the big civil rights leaders like Andy Young, Al Sharpton are [[01:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=6654.179999999999s)]
*  all behind this idea. [[01:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=6659.0199999999995s)]
*  This idea. So we can solve all these problems and the anxieties and the debate [[01:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=6660.78s)]
*  about the voting system and whether you need ID or not to vote. [[01:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=6666.179999999999s)]
*  Right now, Democrats oppose ID laws. [[01:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=6669.42s)]
*  And the reason they oppose it is they say if you get if you force people to show an [[01:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=6673.58s)]
*  ID, you're disenfranchising a lot of students who don't have driver's license. [[01:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=6679.1s)]
*  You're disenfranchising poor people who live in the city who don't have driver's [[01:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=6684.26s)]
*  license. And there's other people in the country, elderly people, a lot of their [[01:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=6688.02s)]
*  license have lapsed, so they don't have ID and you disenfranchise all of those. [[01:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=6693.5s)]
*  Those are all Democrats. [[01:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=6697.1s)]
*  So the Democrats say we shouldn't ID laws. [[01:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=6698.22s)]
*  Now we've got civil rights leaders who are saying, yeah, let's have IDs to vote, [[01:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=6701.780000000001s)]
*  but let's give everybody an ID so everybody can get one. [[01:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=6706.06s)]
*  Right. Then nobody has an excuse. [[01:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=6709.34s)]
*  And nobody has an excuse. [[01:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=6710.740000000001s)]
*  Yeah. What do you say to some people would say that that that takes away some of the [[01:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=6712.02s)]
*  old like adage and the old like a romantic idea of like you can come to America and [[01:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=6717.5s)]
*  you can make it here. [[01:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=6724.820000000001s)]
*  Does that does that do that by making the border? [[01:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=6726.099999999999s)]
*  Because what are you doing making the border more organized? [[01:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=6728.82s)]
*  You're not saying there's no country in the world that has an insecure border. [[01:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=6730.7s)]
*  Yeah, I think we have to be able to control who comes in. [[01:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=6737.099999999999s)]
*  Now, what I would do, I think we should have high fences, but wide gates. [[01:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=6741.74s)]
*  We should let a lot of people in legally, make it much easier to get citizenship. [[01:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=6746.0599999999995s)]
*  And make sure that there's plenty of people to, you know, to for employers, etc. [[01:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=6751.74s)]
*  So that we can keep our country humming. [[01:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=6759.139999999999s)]
*  Yeah. Right. [[01:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=6761.26s)]
*  And but we should be able to select who comes through, not have the Mexican drug cartel [[01:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=6762.179999999999s)]
*  select. [[01:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=6766.86s)]
*  I agree. It's a good point. [[01:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=6767.42s)]
*  No, it's I mean, it's disheartening. [[01:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=6769.219999999999s)]
*  It's very scary to think that anybody can just come in, you know? [[01:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=6770.62s)]
*  I mean, I know that we're all here and we're blessed to be here. [[01:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=6773.9s)]
*  I just think it needs to be organized. [[01:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxGjncnX9n8&t=6776.66s)]
