*  I get a little scared sometimes when I think when things are going well or when things [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=111.67999999999999s)]
*  are feeling good. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=118.08s)]

*  I think there's a little part of me that feels like, oh, you don't deserve it. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=129.44s)]
*  It's not something's wrong. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=133.0s)]
*  I think I'm just so used to the feelings inside of me over the years not being good ones [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=135.04s)]
*  that I'm that those are the footprints. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=143.72s)]

*  You know, and so only recently have I felt like I'm kind of making some new shapes in [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=155.16s)]
*  the mud. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=161.24s)]

*  And yeah, it's just such a foreign it's just been foreign to my life to feel OK. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=171.32000000000002s)]
*  It's been foreign to me. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=178.32000000000002s)]
*  And sometimes there's a part of me that doesn't want to that doesn't want to be it doesn't [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=185.08s)]

*  If I'm real honest. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=190.76s)]
*  There's a part of me that always wants to have something wrong. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=196.32s)]
*  There's a part of me that always wants to be able to. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=204.07999999999998s)]
*  Look at the world. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=208.67999999999998s)]
*  Or look at myself. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=211.28s)]
*  Or look at my past and say, I told you so. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=212.6s)]

*  But anyway, yeah, it was just very corporate. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=524.24s)]
*  You know, every 30 seconds, they're stopping it and selling something. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=527.24s)]
*  And it just gets real corporate to the point where you're like, you almost [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=530.44s)]
*  it's hard to even pay attention to the game. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=533.96s)]
*  There's so much going on. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=537.4000000000001s)]
*  But I felt grateful to be able to go and have that experience. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=540.08s)]
*  I went down there with [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=542.9200000000001s)]
*  with raising canes with some of them Louisiana boys. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=545.0s)]

*  There's like there's like rich people and somebody's [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=610.88s)]
*  somebody was like being real rich and then somebody was next to him and they were. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=616.04s)]
*  You know, they started crying and the other person is like, don't cry, you're rich. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=621.12s)]
*  You know, so people were just being fucking rich in this place. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=626.0s)]
*  And [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=629.24s)]
*  and so we walk up and Blake Shelton is there. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=632.08s)]
*  And I like Blake Shelton, man. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=636.64s)]
*  I like Blake Shelton. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=639.0s)]
*  He is an Oklahoma guy. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=642.88s)]
*  And he, you know, he just sings and he's a comfortable man. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=645.72s)]
*  And I've met him before and [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=649.48s)]
*  and I like him, I like him. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=653.16s)]
*  So anyway, we walk up, Blake Shelton is playing. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=657.04s)]
*  It's like it's like the part in the evening at a party where somebody is playing music. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=659.4s)]
*  So everybody kind of has to be quiet. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=662.96s)]
*  And we walk up and there's a guy, Steve Mariucci. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=664.76s)]
*  OK, he's a coach. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=668.6s)]

*  that's Italian, you know, and he looks Italian, you know, he looks like if you if you tickle him, [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=677.48s)]
*  he'll fucking just he'll tell you all the ingredients of a cannoli, even if he doesn't want to. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=683.64s)]
*  You know, he just has that that look to him. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=689.08s)]
*  That look to him. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=692.0400000000001s)]
*  And I walk up and Steve Mariucci is talking to Drew Brees. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=692.96s)]
*  And I've had dreams in my life, in my head where I'm like, how do you meet? [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=699.12s)]
*  Do you ever meet Drew Brees? [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=703.24s)]
*  Does God want you to ever meet Drew Brees? [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=705.0400000000001s)]
*  You know, does Mother Nature, is there ever another flood? [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=708.32s)]
*  And one of y'all gets flooded right up next to the other one. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=712.48s)]
*  And you get to finally meet. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=716.24s)]
*  And so there he is. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=719.92s)]
*  And so when you're with David Spade, David Spade can kind of just go up to anybody [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=721.7199999999999s)]
*  and like be like, and people are like happy about it. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=726.36s)]
*  So I'm just kind of milling around in the distance being like, hey, look at David Spade. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=731.4s)]
*  And so anyway, he walks, Spade walks up and I just kind of like in his shadow, [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=737.4399999999999s)]
*  like kind of there, but hiding, but trying to be like confident, like, OK, how do I? [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=743.64s)]
*  How do I walk up to Drew Brees? [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=749.0s)]
*  You know, do I look like a do I look right at him? [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=750.64s)]
*  Do I kind of look, you know, at the moon? [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=755.12s)]
*  Like, well, you know, how do you do it? [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=758.12s)]
*  Do I, you know, put my shoulders even? [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=760.4799999999999s)]
*  Do I kind of like be like one shoulder is heavier? [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=762.56s)]
*  Do I? What do I do? [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=767.76s)]
*  You know, and I was nervous, man. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=770.56s)]
*  And so David kind of starts joking and they're both excited to see Spade [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=772.24s)]
*  in there talking to him. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=777.2s)]
*  And I'm right there. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=778.44s)]
*  And I know at some point it's coming around that Spade is going to introduce me. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=779.08s)]
*  So I'm like, what? [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=784.6800000000001s)]
*  You know, how do I how do I look when he's like, hey, this is the only way to smile? [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=785.6400000000001s)]
*  Do I? So I don't know what to do. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=791.8000000000001s)]
*  So I open my mouth, right, which is insane. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=794.6800000000001s)]
*  I think that's an insane. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=797.08s)]
*  You know, you're OK, guys, mouth open. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=800.0s)]
*  And then I put both hands out like this. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=802.4000000000001s)]
*  Like, if you know, if you ask somebody, how long is something I say, oh, about. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=807.72s)]
*  One foot long. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=811.9200000000001s)]
*  That's what I did. He like David introduced me to each guy and I. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=814.08s)]
*  It was almost like you had given somebody. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=820.2s)]
*  It was almost like that guy maybe in what's the sport, maybe. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=824.88s)]
*  Is that rugby or cricket when the guy does? [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=831.08s)]
*  That, you know, anyway, so I did two hands, two hands, [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=835.28s)]
*  shaped Mariuchi and and breeze. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=841.04s)]
*  And so out the gate, I'm like, oh, God, this, you know, I'm not doing that good. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=844.64s)]
*  Hey, I'm not doing good, you know, and I started just kind of praying for myself. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=850.6s)]
*  Which you're not supposed to do. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=858.12s)]
*  I know that, you know, you're supposed to pray for others. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=859.4s)]
*  You're supposed to pray for others. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=862.1999999999999s)]
*  But I did I I needed I needed it. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=864.0s)]
*  And I was right there and I'm like, what do you say? [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=868.12s)]
*  When do you say something? Do you say anything? [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=870.0799999999999s)]
*  Who are you? Are you someone that says something soon? Are you not? [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=872.88s)]
*  Do you just listen? Do you laugh? [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=877.64s)]
*  How loud do you laugh? Do you laugh? [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=880.48s)]
*  You don't want to sound like a fake, you know? [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=882.76s)]
*  So anyway, I'm just being alive. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=886.1999999999999s)]
*  And. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=889.64s)]
*  And Breeze is dialed in, bro, when you're talking to him, [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=893.2399999999999s)]
*  he's like you can see in his eye, but he could play for, I think another. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=897.88s)]
*  I think he could play for another 20 months in the NFL. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=904.8399999999999s)]
*  Well. He's just he's so locked in, like you're talking to him [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=908.9599999999999s)]
*  and you can see he's watching like where the waiters and the busboys are going. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=913.64s)]
*  You know, he can see the, you know, that one of the waiters is running an out [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=919.0799999999999s)]
*  route to go on a smoke break. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=923.92s)]
*  He can see that the busboy did a curl, but, you know, short of the sticks. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=925.92s)]
*  You can't I mean, he's like he's caught, you know, he's got an audible. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=930.56s)]
*  He's got Colston going over. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=935.3599999999999s)]
*  There's everything he's he is monitoring everything. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=936.68s)]
*  While you're there talking to him, he is dialed in. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=940.9599999999999s)]
*  He is dialed into life. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=944.88s)]
*  And you don't even know if Drew Brees blinks. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=948.04s)]
*  That's how much he he blinks when you blink. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=950.2s)]
*  He sees you blink. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=953.68s)]
*  So that's when he that's when he blinks. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=954.8s)]
*  He ain't missing a moment. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=957.28s)]
*  He's locked in. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=959.76s)]
*  And it was interesting because I asked him, I said, [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=963.32s)]
*  hey, did you guys ever play against each other? [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=966.08s)]
*  Him and Mariucci, right? [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=967.76s)]
*  And and Breeze was like, yeah, we sure did. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=971.36s)]
*  And he rattled off the date. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=974.48s)]
*  He rattled off the score. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=976.32s)]
*  And you could just I mean, he is just an anthology of. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=981.04s)]
*  Of precision. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=988.04s)]
*  Is kind of how I would describe it as much as I got to, you know, [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=991.32s)]
*  I got to talk with them for maybe about 10 minutes total. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=994.16s)]
*  And maybe 90 seconds, I could kind of feel my arms and legs. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=999.76s)]
*  While I was doing it. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=1005.28s)]

*  Do you feel like I think we're living, we're getting into a space where people do not feel supported by. [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=1535.44s)]
*  Their country, they don't feel like there's this. [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=1544.1200000000001s)]
*  They're always used to feel like this texture behind us that our country was unified and supporting us and looking out for the regular man and woman and the child who was getting a pail of clean water in East Palestine. [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=1547.64s)]
*  As opposed to the big business, you know, big chloride or whoever spilled all this shit. [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=1564.16s)]
*  And then now you got a lady. [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=1573.6s)]
*  And the water looks. [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=1582.6s)]
*  Wow. [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=1583.6s)]
*  Look at all that. [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=1585.6s)]
*  Look at it. [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=1586.6s)]
*  It's all in the bottom of the creek bed. [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=1587.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=1591.6s)]
*  I mean, you don't know also, they could have, we don't know. [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=1593.6s)]
*  You don't know a video. [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=1596.6s)]
*  Somebody, this thing could be right outside of a pet boys and they've been spilling shit back in there for years. [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=1597.6s)]
*  I'm not denying it. [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=1601.6s)]
*  I'm just saying that who knows? [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=1602.6s)]
*  But yeah, there'll be shrimp coming out of here probably a decade from now wearing a fucking top hat. [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=1604.6s)]
*  You'll have a, you know, in a neck brace. [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=1610.6s)]
*  It's all going to be bad. [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=1612.6s)]
*  Newborn babies could come out with fucking, you know, in with neck braces on their knees. [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=1613.6s)]
*  It's gonna, who knows? [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=1620.6s)]
*  Who knows what's going to happen? [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=1621.6s)]
*  A lot of, you know, they're gonna have a lot of young women that look like Rob Gronkowski probably. [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=1624.6s)]
*  Who know? [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=1629.6s)]
*  We don't know. [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=1630.6s)]
*  But we're there with you in spirit. [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=1632.6s)]
*  What else can we be? [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=1635.6s)]
*  That's all we can be right now. [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=1637.6s)]
*  All right. [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=1640.6s)]
*  As some of you guys know, Kai the Hitchhiker, who is a notorious inner figure in entertainment, I guess. [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=1641.6s)]
*  He's a homeless or not homeless. [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=1654.6s)]
*  He's a vagabond. [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=1657.6s)]
*  He is a tumbleweed with a bit of violence that surrounds him. [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=1659.6s)]
*  That's all I'll say. [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=1668.6s)]
*  He filed a lawsuit against me for a TikTok clip that was put up or Instagram clip that I didn't create, that I shared. [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=1671.6s)]
*  And I wanted to talk with my buddy Dan Morgan over at the Morgan & Morgan attorney firm, [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=1682.6s)]
*  at the Morgan & Morgan law firm and see what the deal was. [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=1691.6s)]
*  So let's make that call now if we can. [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=1696.6s)]
*  Hello, this is Dan. [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=1702.6s)]
*  Hey, Dan, man. [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=1703.6s)]
*  What's up, bud? It's Theo. [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=1705.6s)]
*  Hey, man. [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=1706.6s)]
*  What's going on? [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=1707.6s)]
*  Well, I sent you, you know, I got served. [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=1708.6s)]
*  I want to talk about the Kai the Hitchhiker thing. [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=1712.6s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah, for sure. [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=1716.6s)]
*  I got those documents. [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=1717.6s)]
*  I reviewed them actually over the weekend. [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=1718.6s)]
*  Yeah, man. [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=1720.6s)]
*  So is it a real thing? [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=1721.6s)]
*  Like, is it? [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=1724.6s)]
*  I'm just, I guess I'm kind of, I don't know. [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=1726.6s)]
*  You know, I guess I'm scared. [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=1729.6s)]
*  Yeah, I'm scared of it. [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=1730.6s)]
*  I don't know what to do. [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=1732.6s)]
*  It is real in the sense that he did file it. [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=1733.6s)]
*  He did make some claims. [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=1736.6s)]
*  He's currently incarcerated, I believe, in New Jersey, it seems. [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=1737.6s)]
*  And he kind of learned the law a little bit and drafted up this complaint. [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=1741.6s)]
*  So it is an actual complaint that did get served in federal court. [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=1745.6s)]
*  You know, as far as the merits to it, I don't think there's much there. [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=1749.6s)]
*  I think a motion to dismiss will kind of clean it up for you. [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=1752.6s)]
*  OK, so what do I, what is he asking for? [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=1757.6s)]
*  So he's making some pretty egregious claims in there. [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=1761.6s)]
*  I mean, he goes into a lot of TMI really about these other cases and these other legal trouble that's going on. [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=1764.6s)]
*  But then he pretty much does some type of algebraic equation that gets to a demand request somewhere around 30 million dollars. [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=1770.6s)]
*  I think it's around 20, 29,750 thousand something around those damages. [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=1781.6s)]
*  What? [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=1786.6s)]
*  From YouTube and Instagram views. [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=1787.6s)]
*  Well, what do I do? [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=1788.6s)]
*  I must have to work. [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=1790.6s)]
*  I mean, do I have to work forever or what? [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=1791.6s)]
*  I mean, it sounds like he's claiming you've already made this money. [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=1793.6s)]
*  So the question is, what have you done with all that money? [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=1796.6s)]
*  Dude, what is he talking about, dude? [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=1799.6s)]
*  I fucking have a, I drive a Ford Ranger. [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=1801.6s)]
*  He's saying you made all this money off using this deep fake of him. [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=1804.6s)]
*  You've stolen his valor, so to speak. [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=1809.6s)]
*  I didn't steal his value. [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=1812.6s)]
*  He's saying it's a mother. [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=1814.6s)]
*  No, you're all good. [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=1816.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=1817.6s)]
*  He has this whole outlandish theory that you have a fake identity daughter account where you made this and then repurpose it to then to then post on your YouTube and without having to be the point person that he could go after. [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=1818.6s)]
*  Wow. [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=1829.6s)]
*  It's like a 30 page manifesto complaint. [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=1830.6s)]
*  He's, he's, he's, he's done it. [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=1834.6s)]
*  He's done it. [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=1836.6s)]
*  He's done it. [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=1837.6s)]
*  He's done it. [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=1838.6s)]
*  He's done it. [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=1839.6s)]
*  He's done it. [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=1840.6s)]
*  Manifesto complaint. [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=1841.6s)]
*  He, he's, he's, he's doctored up from, from this federal penitentiary. [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=1842.6s)]
*  So is this so, so what is, when do I, how long do, when do I need to, when do I need to do something? [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=1848.6s)]
*  So it looks like you got, like he served you about eight days ago or so. [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=1856.6s)]
*  So like you have 21 days per, per federal civil procedure. [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=1860.6s)]
*  So, you know, just, just an answer pretty much saying, you know, this is a bogus. [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=1864.6s)]
*  Also the motion to dismiss and a judge should just throw it out for you. [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=1869.6s)]
*  But you have to kind of make sure you get those timelines done or else there could be a default judgment where old guy could get a check from field for 30 million. [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=1874.6s)]
*  Well, he's never, I don't know where he even cash it. [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=1882.6s)]
*  That's a thing. [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=1885.6s)]
*  I'm Scott. [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=1887.6s)]
*  I think my ticket. [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=1888.6s)]
*  Okay. [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=1892.6s)]
*  So what do you, do you, does, does y'all's law firm help with that? [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=1893.6s)]
*  Or is that something I need to do? [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=1896.6s)]
*  That's something that I can help you get, get to the right person. [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=1898.6s)]
*  We're, we're, we're more of a plaintiff's type firm. [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=1901.6s)]
*  We don't know what to do this defense work, but I can definitely get you in the right hands out there with the California federal attorney. [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=1903.6s)]
*  Get this thing cleaned up for you. [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=1909.6s)]
*  Okay. [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=1910.6s)]
*  Jesus, dude. [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=1911.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=1912.6s)]
*  Yeah, I can't, I mean, um, and is this, is this going to be like a thing that happens in the world? [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=1913.6s)]
*  Because this was a deep fake that I didn't have anything to do with. [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=1919.6s)]
*  I mean, obviously I repurposed it and put it out and I think I thought it was funny and entertaining. [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=1923.6s)]
*  So I don't know if there is some responsibility there. [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=1929.6s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=1932.6s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=1933.6s)]
*  And when you kind of sent this over to me, I kind of started doing some research and it's obviously that's popping up more and more now with technology. [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=1934.6s)]
*  Get in as it is, you can just really put in any video with any picture and it turns it out. [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=1940.6s)]
*  But, you know, pretty much it falls under some copyright exceptions where, where it's parody. [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=1945.6s)]
*  It's an ultimate defense. [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=1950.6s)]
*  So, um, you know, it's, it's art, it's parody. [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=1951.6s)]
*  It's not meant to be real. [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=1953.6s)]
*  You know, there's some protections out there, especially like political figures and revenge porn stuff like that, where there's been laws that have been put, put into place for deep fakes. [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=1954.6s)]
*  But as far as, you know, this type of stuff is really, it's just parody where, where there's no real recourse or damages that can be assessed for it. [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=1963.6s)]
*  Wow. [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=1970.6s)]
*  It's interesting because it's, it, that's going to be, I mean, with, with CGI and that sort of this kind of thing, this is going to be probably a growing field. [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=1971.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=1979.6s)]
*  Oh, it's popping up. [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=1980.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=1981.6s)]
*  Cause I mean, they got, you know, when the political race is around, they'll just take the, whatever party they don't like and just have them saying some outlandish, outlandish comments. [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=1982.6s)]
*  It's like, you know, crazy stances and they put it out there on YouTube and it gets retweeted. [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=1991.6s)]
*  And I say, you know, it becomes fact. [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=1996.6s)]
*  How, I mean, how do we, what does the future hold? [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=1999.6s)]
*  I mean, even now, I mean, the videos are getting better and better. [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=2003.6s)]
*  And now they even have it where you can type in, you know, manifestos or lyrics and it will spit it out in the person's voice too. [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=2008.6s)]
*  So there doesn't even have to be a recording and saying, it's just, you know, copying of their vocals now and spitting it out. [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=2016.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=2022.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=2023.6s)]
*  We've just been talking about some of that recently, that chat GPT, I think it's called. [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=2024.6s)]
*  And when that merges with like holograms or deep fakes, it's going to get, I mean, it's going to get really strange. [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=2027.6s)]
*  You know, I saw a thing a while back where they had so much footage and audio of Joe Rogan that they could make him have, they could have audio of him now saying absolutely almost anything in the world. [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=2033.6s)]
*  Oh, exactly. [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=2045.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=2046.6s)]
*  And that's how they have it. [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=2047.6s)]
*  All these politicians, not to make speeches, you know, three speeches a day. [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=2048.6s)]
*  They're just downloading it all. [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=2052.6s)]
*  So, hey, let's make them say, you know, listen to like other like, like power started the pastor would take, I mean, years to chop up something to have it even not even some now. [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=2053.6s)]
*  It's just piping into a, into a chat pod and spits it out in 30 seconds. [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=2061.6s)]
*  Yeah, man. [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=2065.6s)]
*  I mean, all we cared about was make them say, uh, nah, nah, nah, nah. [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=2066.6s)]
*  And it's just changed so much. [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=2070.6s)]
*  Is this, is this going to be a field that you guys will cover a lot at Shell's law firm or is this? [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=2072.6s)]
*  I mean, if there was, there was damages against the natural planet where if there was some real harm that was done and, you know, intimate came from it, we definitely look, look into it. [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=2079.6s)]
*  But as far as just these celebrities having deep fakes made and stuff like that, you know, it's probably something we're going to stay away and just see how the law evolves around it. [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=2090.6s)]
*  Amen. [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=2099.6s)]
*  Dude, thanks so much, man. [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=2100.6s)]
*  I appreciate it, bro. [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=2101.6s)]
*  It's definitely been spooky. [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=2102.6s)]
*  And yeah, the guy came up and served the papers and I thought it was like a dude, like a, I don't want to say like a homeless dude, not home. [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=2103.6s)]
*  I mean, he was like, yeah, they're sneaky. [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=2110.6s)]
*  Those process servers get sneaky with it, bro. [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=2112.6s)]
*  I thought it was like kind of a like kind of a dude who was being kind of homoerotic or something, because he kind of just was hitting on you. [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=2114.6s)]
*  What's hitting on you? [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=2122.6s)]
*  I mean, he just like kind of moseyed up. [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=2123.6s)]
*  I thought he'd written me a poem or something. [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=2125.6s)]
*  And then, and then he hit me with that. [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=2127.6s)]
*  And he kind of like he didn't give like, yeah, yeah. [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=2130.6s)]
*  Kind of like it was just, I don't know, but I'm trying to meet a white guy. [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=2134.6s)]
*  It was just surprising. [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=2139.6s)]
*  I'd never really been served any papers. [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=2141.6s)]
*  I'd seen it happen a lot, but I'd never gotten myself. [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=2143.6s)]
*  So it was almost kind of nice, dude. [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=2146.6s)]
*  And it was almost like a Valentine in a weird way. [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=2148.6s)]
*  Right. [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=2150.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=2152.6s)]

*  Over the fucking cord. [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=2222.6s)]
*  And, you know, I just had a question, man. [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=2224.6s)]
*  So I got a friend and he's my best friend. [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=2228.6s)]
*  One of my best friends. [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=2232.6s)]
*  We started becoming friends a few years ago. [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=2233.6s)]
*  Man, he's been cheating on his girlfriend and I don't really like any of that. [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=2236.6s)]
*  I told him, man, I'm going to need to tell you a girlfriend. [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=2242.6s)]
*  If you're cheating on her, man, I'll give you a week to tell her. [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=2246.6s)]
*  Man, that week went by and I told him, man, I need to tell you a girl. [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=2250.6s)]
*  He's like, man, don't worry about it. [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=2253.6s)]
*  We're not getting broken up. [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=2255.6s)]
*  So, you know, like, what do I do in that situation? [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=2257.6s)]
*  I don't want to tell his girlfriend because he's my homie. [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=2261.6s)]
*  But at the same time, I hate cheaters because my dad cheated on my mom back in the day. [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=2264.6s)]
*  And, you know, that shit really fucks me up. [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=2269.6s)]
*  And I've been cheating on them. [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=2271.6s)]
*  So. [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=2273.6s)]
*  Meth or corn, baby? [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=2274.6s)]
*  Meth or corn? [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=2277.6s)]
*  That's a lifelong question, brother. [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=2279.6s)]
*  I feel you. [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=2281.6s)]
*  I think you got it. [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=2282.6s)]
*  You can definitely say to your buddy, hey, not cool to cheat on this gal. [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=2283.6s)]
*  I don't know if you go tell the gal, though. [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=2287.6s)]
*  That's a little bit snitchy. [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=2290.6s)]
*  That's a little bit like I'm going to take responsibility. [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=2291.6s)]
*  You know, it's not that's not your world. [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=2296.6s)]
*  So, I mean, it's your world, but it's I don't know. [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=2303.6s)]
*  That to me feels like you're trying to control too much of things. [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=2306.6s)]
*  Now, maybe if it goes on for a long, you know, it's so tough to know, but I feel like that's a little bit more of a thing you take up with your boy. [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=2313.6s)]
*  That's what you do. [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=2322.6s)]
*  You take it up with your boy. [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=2323.6s)]
*  Hey, man, I don't think this is a good thing. [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=2324.6s)]
*  You know, I wish you wouldn't do this. [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=2327.6s)]
*  But then also, I mean, who knows? [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=2334.6s)]
*  You know, it's tough. [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=2335.6s)]
*  You may have a feeling for that girl, but I don't know if that's the way to go about it. [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=2336.6s)]
*  I would start with your boy, man. [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=2341.6s)]
*  I would say it again. [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=2343.6s)]
*  And then if you put a week on him and you didn't do nothing, then you're not even really about it anyway. [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=2344.6s)]
*  So if you're going to be about it, be about it. [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=2350.6s)]
*  You know, so I would say, man, I can't, you know, if you're going to be that's not the vibe I like to put out there. [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=2353.6s)]
*  It's not something I want to be associated with. [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=2361.6s)]
*  Then that's fair. [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=2363.6s)]
*  But then you got to stand by that with him. [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=2364.6s)]
*  If you just tell him every week, hey, man, don't be cheating or I'm out of here. [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=2366.6s)]
*  And then you stick around. [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=2371.6s)]
*  You know, then you're going to tell her that you didn't even do nothing. [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=2377.6s)]
*  You didn't even do nothing. [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=2382.6s)]
*  So praise God, baby. [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=2384.6s)]

*  You know, they don't like to put all the different, you know, uses or whatever on the thing. [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=2764.6s)]
*  But if I got, you know, somebody in my area and they're over there splurging that little that little splash hammer right in front of me, [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=2768.6s)]

*  I'm sorry that you're having to deal with some of this. [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=2787.6s)]
*  And I'm almost afraid of some students because we found it. [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=2789.6s)]
*  We found a collection of almost like a booger collection, but it was it was other people's pictures that he took from under stairwell. [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=2795.6s)]
*  So, but we've been working on stuff. [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=2807.6s)]
*  I don't know what to do with him. [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=2811.6s)]
*  Well, he might be damn an artist, brother. [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=2813.6s)]
*  You can't, you know, it sounds like he's an artist. [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=2815.6s)]
*  So don't condemn him for that. [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=2818.6s)]
*  And, you know, I know they can't help it, but every time I every time I look him in the eyes, he's just he's just panting with that lustful. [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=2820.6s)]
*  He'll smirk when he does it, too. [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=2830.6s)]
*  It's like he knows what he's doing. [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=2833.6s)]
*  That's heat, brother. [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=2835.6s)]
*  He's in heat. [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=2836.6s)]
*  And that's somebody in heat. [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=2838.6s)]
*  And so I think at that point, you got to do prayer. [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=2839.6s)]
*  You got to you got to consider Narcan. [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=2841.6s)]
*  But I would do prayer first. [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=2844.6s)]

*  And, you know, I don't know anybody from my biological side. [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=3278.6s)]
*  And I decided to do some searching. [[00:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=3285.6s)]
*  I found my mother on Facebook and I found some bad news. [[00:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=3287.6s)]

*  Thanks to my own, you know, or you may not even have any more of that shit, but how do I rise above that to be whatever? [[00:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=3589.6s)]
*  How do I be a great son and an adult son? [[01:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=3601.6s)]
*  You know, I've had trouble evolving in that way. [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=3608.6s)]
*  Involving from being just a son to being an adult son. [[01:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=3611.6s)]
*  It's funny. It's just kind of a space that I'm in in my life. [[01:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=3627.6s)]
*  But man, I and I didn't mean to talk about myself so much. [[01:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=3630.6s)]
*  It just it's powerful that you chose to share that with us, man. [[01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=3632.6s)]
*  You know how good that makes us feel? [[01:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=3636.6s)]
*  First of all, to have an urban guy call urban person that even fucking messes with us, bro. [[01:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=3641.6s)]
*  Praise God, though. [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=3648.6s)]
*  But even more than that, just that. [[01:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=3651.6s)]
*  That you're like, hey, I'm going to I'm going to be. [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=3654.6s)]
*  That you let all of us you let us enjoy that moment with you. [[01:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=3659.6s)]
*  You let us in on that, man. You know how much that is going to give us something? [[01:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=3665.6s)]
*  It's going to give us a little bit more faith that's going to get us through the next day, the next hour. [[01:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=3671.6s)]
*  And there's some people just might be a minute, but it's going to give us something. [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=3676.6s)]
*  It gives me a real want to believe that there's things out there that are working for good. [[01:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=3680.6s)]
*  That's cool, man. So excited for you, bro. [[01:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=3687.6s)]
*  If you get a chance, man, hit the hotline again. [[01:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=3691.6s)]
*  I would just love to know how it went. [[01:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=3695.6s)]
*  You know, but if you are in that space where you say, hey, man, this is something powerful and I'm going to call him a share. [[01:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=3698.6s)]
*  This is I'm going to let this be a part of this ambiance of this show. [[01:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=3704.6s)]

*  And yeah, we'll connect. [[01:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=3711.6s)]
*  And let me see. Maybe there's something nice we could do to help out or help her. [[01:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=3714.6s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=3718.6s)]
*  But somehow. [[01:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=3723.6s)]
*  Even though even though it was giving you up or what, I don't know. [[01:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=3729.6s)]
*  I don't know any of it. [[01:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=3733.6s)]
*  But she. [[01:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=3735.6s)]
*  She helped make a good son. [[01:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=3738.6s)]
*  You know, she helped make a good son somehow. [[01:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=3742.6s)]
*  So, man. [[01:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=3748.6s)]
*  You know, this stuff, I guess, makes me want to be alive. [[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=3754.6s)]
*  It makes me want to be alive. [[01:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=3759.6s)]
*  You know, it's those moments, man, where you fucking something, you feel something. [[01:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=3764.6s)]
*  God, that shit is high. That is a high, bro. [[01:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=3769.6s)]
*  That is a high, bro. [[01:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=3774.6s)]
*  Praise God, baby. Thank you for calling in. [[01:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=3777.6s)]
*  I don't know. I mean, what you know, what else are we going to say? [[01:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=3780.6s)]
*  Yeah, that's you know, I feel like it's just a good place to to finish the show today. [[01:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=3788.6s)]

*  I feel like it's just a good place to to finish the show today. [[01:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=3796.6s)]

*  I'm grateful to be here with you guys. [[01:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=3802.6s)]
*  I'm grateful we're going to be adding work. We're going to try to get over to England. [[01:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=3805.6s)]
*  We got we're going to try to get to everywhere. [[01:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=3809.6s)]
*  You know, we're putting the shows out as we can. [[01:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=3812.6s)]
*  Next week, we'll have some new shows going up in, I think, in St. [[01:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=3816.6s)]
*  George, Utah or Springdale, Utah. [[01:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=3820.6s)]
*  We're figuring some of that out if you have a plan to be down there. [[01:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=3823.6s)]
*  That would be around the second week of July. [[01:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=3826.6s)]
*  That would be around the second week of July. [[01:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=3829.6s)]
*  Let's go out the way that we didn't even come in. [[01:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=3832.6s)]
*  Let's go out the way that we didn't even come in. [[01:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=3835.6s)]
*  We'll just close it out, man. [[01:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=3838.6s)]
*  A lot of neat stuff. I don't know what else to say. [[01:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=3841.6s)]
*  Maybe we've said enough. [[01:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=3844.6s)]
*  I don't know. I feel like there's something else I'm supposed to be telling you guys. [[01:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=3847.6s)]
*  But to all the people out there struggling with these people, with the stuff in the Midwest and the fear and stuff like that is scary. [[01:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=3850.6s)]
*  You know, it's scary to think that that this template of the world we sometimes we feel, especially in America, like our environment, that the world, the government, all this is going to take care of us. [[01:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=3857.6s)]
*  And when that doesn't happen, it's very scary because we realize we're just this being. [[01:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=3870.6s)]
*  Because we realize we're just this being in this in this in this template of society that we've created and that if some of that structure fails us or doesn't do us right, we're still sitting there responsible for ourselves. [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=3875.6s)]
*  And that's very scary. [[01:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=3894.6s)]
*  So my heart goes out to the people that are in fear of that. [[01:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=3896.6s)]
*  And what else, man? [[01:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=3899.6s)]
*  Man, I don't know. I've been jerking off, but I don't want to be. [[01:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=3902.6s)]
*  So it's been getting better. [[01:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=3911.6s)]
*  It's been getting better. And that's all we can ask. [[01:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=3915.6s)]
*  You guys be good to yourselves, man. [[01:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=3918.6s)]
*  You deserve it. And we will. [[01:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=3920.6s)]
*  Let's go out with some Bishop again. [[01:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrKFXIXvy0&t=3922.6s)]
