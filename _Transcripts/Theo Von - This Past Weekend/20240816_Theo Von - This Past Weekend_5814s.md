*  So, okay, so you're growing up in Huntsville and then how do things start kind of pop and you're doing music you're running track [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06Fa2uH4UkA&t=1098.3400000000001s)]
*  And what's going on you run by the music teacher and just hit some bars or what? [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06Fa2uH4UkA&t=1103.42s)]
*  No, I started like [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06Fa2uH4UkA&t=1108.58s)]
*  Posting online and then it just kind of took off from there. Yeah on tick-tock. Yeah [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06Fa2uH4UkA&t=1110.62s)]
*  Wow, so do you think that these like now like people want to like do most young people think I? [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06Fa2uH4UkA&t=1114.9399999999998s)]
*  Need to be good at music or I need to be good on social media. I wonder whoa. That's a really good question [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06Fa2uH4UkA&t=1122.1399999999999s)]
*  I don't know probably social media is their first thought I think yeah, I don't know. That's a great question [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06Fa2uH4UkA&t=1128.82s)]
*  I think it's kind of a joint effort though like [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06Fa2uH4UkA&t=1134.78s)]
*  Because if you the music is the first part I'd say actually because you've got to have something there [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06Fa2uH4UkA&t=1138.06s)]
*  I think but then the next step is to make sure that can translate onto a screen. Yeah [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06Fa2uH4UkA&t=1142.98s)]
*  and [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06Fa2uH4UkA&t=1148.74s)]
*  Like in the beginning were you just kind of screwing around or what happened? I haven't seen your earliest tick-tocks. That's good. It's [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06Fa2uH4UkA&t=1150.1s)]
*  Yeah, I don't know [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06Fa2uH4UkA&t=1157.06s)]

*  I was like doing covers and shit. Oh nice. Yeah, and then one of those blew up and then it was right when COVID happened [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06Fa2uH4UkA&t=1163.1s)]
*  So then I was just stuck at home. So I just kept doing it just in the basement. Yes. Oh [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06Fa2uH4UkA&t=1169.1s)]

*  Yeah, it was a good start and then did you start writing some like what was one of your first songs that you wrote? [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06Fa2uH4UkA&t=1178.22s)]
*  I don't even know. I've I've been writing since I was like 11. I just didn't post it when I was 11, which is so good [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06Fa2uH4UkA&t=1183.34s)]

*  Yeah, cuz I'm at me. Yeah [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06Fa2uH4UkA&t=1191.78s)]

*  Is just how many artists you can find, you know, so many talented people on there and there's like things that will come across like [[00:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06Fa2uH4UkA&t=3259.4799999999996s)]
*  I know you had Maddox Batson on your show [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06Fa2uH4UkA&t=3266.8799999999997s)]

*  Yeah, this looks like you when you were a kid or this reminds me of you [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06Fa2uH4UkA&t=3273.3999999999996s)]
*  And so then next thing, you know, like he showed up and we had we went for a ride [[00:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06Fa2uH4UkA&t=3276.0s)]
*  I got a Cybertruck. We went for a ride in it and [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06Fa2uH4UkA&t=3280.0s)]
*  Just ridiculous, you know [[00:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06Fa2uH4UkA&t=3283.0s)]
*  And we got to listen to like his first new song [[00:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06Fa2uH4UkA&t=3285.16s)]
*  Yeah, he's so sweet kid he is he's always like so just uh, oh that's his mom right there [[00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06Fa2uH4UkA&t=3289.48s)]
*  But yeah, that's one thing it's like oh you can hear a lot of [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06Fa2uH4UkA&t=3302.12s)]
*  You can just hear like a lot of new artists people can break through really quick a hundred percent like that situation is crazy [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06Fa2uH4UkA&t=3304.66s)]
*  So young I know what is he like? He's like 13. Yeah, I mean that would be so scary [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06Fa2uH4UkA&t=3312.02s)]
*  That's a crazy cuz it's like I don't think you develop any of your own like thoughts or real like or not thoughts [[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06Fa2uH4UkA&t=3316.54s)]
*  But yeah, no fucking adolescent or whatever. It's called hundred percent and he's also gonna be so massive [[00:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06Fa2uH4UkA&t=3321.7s)]
*  Yeah, it's like people compare him to Justin Bieber all the time [[00:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06Fa2uH4UkA&t=3327.62s)]
*  100% so that's also tough because you're like, how does he just be himself? He seems to be good at it though [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06Fa2uH4UkA&t=3330.38s)]
*  Yeah, I really do feel like he's like made for it [[00:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06Fa2uH4UkA&t=3335.38s)]

*  He just has that about him. He just fits in like it's okay with him. He doesn't even second-guess it [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06Fa2uH4UkA&t=3342.94s)]
*  No, that's also a thing of being so young though. I don't think it's like it registers [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06Fa2uH4UkA&t=3347.32s)]
*  Yeah, the kid isn't really he probably doesn't really like it doesn't feel like it's crazy [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06Fa2uH4UkA&t=3350.64s)]
*  Just cuz you're young [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06Fa2uH4UkA&t=3354.82s)]
*  Right cuz also I think at that age you feel like almost all kids probably feel like a star anyway cuz you're like just that [[00:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06Fa2uH4UkA&t=3355.74s)]
