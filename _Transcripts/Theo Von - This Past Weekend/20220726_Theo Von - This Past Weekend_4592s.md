*  and um [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpOp1PkiOD4&t=753.66s)]
*  And man it's been [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpOp1PkiOD4&t=755.9s)]
*  It has been helping me [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpOp1PkiOD4&t=758.78s)]
*  To a level I can't even explain [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpOp1PkiOD4&t=761.5799999999999s)]
*  Um, I went six days this week, um [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpOp1PkiOD4&t=765.1800000000001s)]
*  And I feel I mean I just feel [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpOp1PkiOD4&t=772.94s)]
*  You know, I feel more outside of myself [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpOp1PkiOD4&t=776.7s)]
*  I don't feel as inside of myself, you know, and I don't feel as in my head [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpOp1PkiOD4&t=781.26s)]
*  Because now i'm using my body i've got a lot of my blood [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpOp1PkiOD4&t=787.4200000000001s)]
*  And a lot of my energy which was just whirling around in my head which is not a safe place to be [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpOp1PkiOD4&t=791.0999999999999s)]
*  Now it's kind of dispersed out [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpOp1PkiOD4&t=799.0999999999999s)]
*  And I feel a more even [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpOp1PkiOD4&t=803.18s)]
*  You know, I think a long time ago as as human beings we had we had to use our senses and we had to use them in the world [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpOp1PkiOD4&t=807.42s)]
*  You know, you had to be like oh there's uh, you know if you walked out there into the world [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpOp1PkiOD4&t=814.4599999999999s)]
*  If you walked out there into the woods, there's a lion possibly [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpOp1PkiOD4&t=819.02s)]
*  And you might hear a damn little warbler in the distance and he might be giving you a clue. Oh, there's a lion [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpOp1PkiOD4&t=823.5s)]
*  And you'd have to be careful because maybe there would be a [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpOp1PkiOD4&t=831.02s)]
*  uh poison ivy [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpOp1PkiOD4&t=834.14s)]
*  Or poison sumac [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpOp1PkiOD4&t=836.38s)]
*  Or some you know something [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpOp1PkiOD4&t=838.46s)]
*  But you'd have to be aware of your surroundings yet, you know all your feelings were outside of you [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpOp1PkiOD4&t=841.34s)]
*  You had to look at the sky, what is the weather? What is the air feeling? What's going on here? [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpOp1PkiOD4&t=849.1s)]
*  So all of our feelings used to be outside of us you had to be aware you had to survive [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpOp1PkiOD4&t=856.86s)]
*  And then humanity we got our society especially in america we got into [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpOp1PkiOD4&t=864.9399999999999s)]
*  More like everybody's everybody's comfortable enough [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpOp1PkiOD4&t=871.66s)]
*  We all have a bed we all have a roof [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpOp1PkiOD4&t=877.1s)]
*  You know, it's it's safe enough we don't you know, we don't all of our senses we haven't used them like that in a long time [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpOp1PkiOD4&t=883.1s)]
*  So now my senses I feel like a lot of times they go they've started to go inward [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpOp1PkiOD4&t=890.7s)]
*  Because there's nothing that alertness that that uh [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpOp1PkiOD4&t=897.9000000000001s)]
*  That uh [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpOp1PkiOD4&t=902.4599999999999s)]
*  It's not it's not necessary in the outside so now they've all gone inward [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpOp1PkiOD4&t=905.9s)]
*  But they're still hunting the lion. They're still looking for something that's uncomfortable or dangerous or alarming [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpOp1PkiOD4&t=910.9399999999999s)]
*  And so that's where I feel like a lot of our mental health is now it's like [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpOp1PkiOD4&t=920.2199999999999s)]
*  The senses that we used to use in [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpOp1PkiOD4&t=927.42s)]
*  To survive [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpOp1PkiOD4&t=930.4599999999999s)]
*  We don't need them outside of us anymore [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpOp1PkiOD4&t=933.5s)]
*  So now those senses they're lurking around inside of me looking for looking for lions [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpOp1PkiOD4&t=936.9399999999999s)]
*  But there is no lions in me [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpOp1PkiOD4&t=944.38s)]
*  Unless i'm some kind of damn centaur or something. There is no lions in me or unless i've eaten a couple cuts of lion [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpOp1PkiOD4&t=947.42s)]
*  So [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpOp1PkiOD4&t=954.0600000000001s)]
*  It just it finds this, you know anything that's a little spooky it finds like things from my past or fears [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpOp1PkiOD4&t=956.94s)]
*  It finds uh, it finds some trouble but it makes it feel like it's a lion, you know [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpOp1PkiOD4&t=966.3000000000001s)]
*  I don't know if that makes any sense. But to me part of it does it's like [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpOp1PkiOD4&t=976.0600000000001s)]
*  I think all those senses we used to use didn't need to survive [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpOp1PkiOD4&t=980.06s)]
*  Because we're wandering around [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpOp1PkiOD4&t=985.66s)]
*  In a world in the open having to go in the caves and see if it was safe to sleep [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpOp1PkiOD4&t=988.9399999999999s)]
*  You know having to you know, know when the sun's coming up so we could navigate the next day [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpOp1PkiOD4&t=997.9s)]
*  Day [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpOp1PkiOD4&t=1004.86s)]
*  We had to just be our a lot of our alertness was outside of our body because it needed to be [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpOp1PkiOD4&t=1007.74s)]
*  But i've been feeling uh, i've been feeling a little better [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpOp1PkiOD4&t=1014.86s)]
*  You know [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpOp1PkiOD4&t=1018.3000000000001s)]
*  And i've just been [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpOp1PkiOD4&t=1019.5s)]

*  um [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpOp1PkiOD4&t=2494.14s)]
*  You know, I was dealing with a lot of anger a few years ago [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpOp1PkiOD4&t=2496.06s)]
*  Uh, even eight months ago, um [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpOp1PkiOD4&t=2499.7400000000002s)]
*  I just wanted everything to be a certain way [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpOp1PkiOD4&t=2504.38s)]

*  And so that left me angry [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpOp1PkiOD4&t=2514.0600000000004s)]
*  I was like this needs to be like this. I couldn't control everything [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpOp1PkiOD4&t=2516.0600000000004s)]
*  And that left me real real angry [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpOp1PkiOD4&t=2519.82s)]
*  I was having a tough time [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpOp1PkiOD4&t=2522.94s)]
*  Um [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpOp1PkiOD4&t=2524.94s)]
*  And some things that i've done for me is i've started a little bit of meditation [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpOp1PkiOD4&t=2526.14s)]
*  You know just 10 minutes put my timer on [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpOp1PkiOD4&t=2531.02s)]
*  You can look up some youtube videos how to meditate and uh [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpOp1PkiOD4&t=2534.62s)]
*  That helps give me a little more space before i'm gonna get angry. It gives me a little more space [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpOp1PkiOD4&t=2539.02s)]
*  Between me and the world [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpOp1PkiOD4&t=2544.7000000000003s)]
*  Because the world is going to make me angry [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpOp1PkiOD4&t=2548.06s)]
*  And if i'm right on if i'm right on top of the world [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpOp1PkiOD4&t=2550.06s)]
*  Then whenever something happens i'm right there [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpOp1PkiOD4&t=2557.42s)]
*  But meditation starts to give you a little bit of space between the world and you it just gives you a little bit of space [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpOp1PkiOD4&t=2562.22s)]
*  Um [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpOp1PkiOD4&t=2569.5s)]
*  I find that that helps I find that asking god to [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpOp1PkiOD4&t=2570.86s)]
*  To [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpOp1PkiOD4&t=2574.22s)]
*  Help you know god, i'm i find myself being really angry [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpOp1PkiOD4&t=2576.46s)]
*  You know and and it affects me and it it affects my loved ones [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpOp1PkiOD4&t=2582.3799999999997s)]
*  And I don't like it [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpOp1PkiOD4&t=2589.18s)]
*  You know and god can you help me uh [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpOp1PkiOD4&t=2592.06s)]
*  To figure out what's going on [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpOp1PkiOD4&t=2596.14s)]
*  Um [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpOp1PkiOD4&t=2600.06s)]
*  And if you believe in god or not it can be the universe it can be a higher power [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpOp1PkiOD4&t=2601.5s)]
*  um [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpOp1PkiOD4&t=2607.02s)]
*  But putting it out there like that it kind of makes you feel not so [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpOp1PkiOD4&t=2608.78s)]
*  Alone about it and you'll start to get some some feedback from the world from god [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpOp1PkiOD4&t=2612.86s)]
*  from whatever [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpOp1PkiOD4&t=2618.54s)]
*  You believe you'll start to get some feedback from it [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpOp1PkiOD4&t=2620.14s)]
*  um [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpOp1PkiOD4&t=2623.82s)]
*  Yeah, i'm trying to think of what what was really [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpOp1PkiOD4&t=2627.02s)]
*  You know and this would be a good one if people have some suggestions for hunter about how to handle this anger [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpOp1PkiOD4&t=2629.66s)]
*  And I guess I can't really tell if it's about your wife or you're just saying that it comes out towards her [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpOp1PkiOD4&t=2636.94s)]
*  um [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpOp1PkiOD4&t=2642.78s)]
*  But one thing i've also noticed for myself is even going back to just doing fitness and stuff that's been helping me a lot [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpOp1PkiOD4&t=2644.54s)]
*  You know, it's been helping me get out of myself just it just gets a lot of energy out of me [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpOp1PkiOD4&t=2651.1s)]
*  Um [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpOp1PkiOD4&t=2656.38s)]
*  And it makes me feel more in control [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpOp1PkiOD4&t=2659.42s)]
*  A lot of times I feel anger when i'm not in i'm not in control in in some way and so anger just comes out [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpOp1PkiOD4&t=2663.42s)]
*  um [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpOp1PkiOD4&t=2672.7s)]
*  Let me try and think about it for just a second [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpOp1PkiOD4&t=2675.98s)]
*  You [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpOp1PkiOD4&t=2678.9399999999996s)]
*  Know I didn't like being angry man [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpOp1PkiOD4&t=2683.3399999999997s)]
*  I'd find myself I could I was literally watching myself behave ways that I didn't want to be [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpOp1PkiOD4&t=2687.8999999999996s)]
*  And a lot of it was because [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpOp1PkiOD4&t=2699.8999999999996s)]
*  I [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpOp1PkiOD4&t=2702.78s)]
*  For me it was control. I wanted things to be a certain way. They weren't that way certain things [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpOp1PkiOD4&t=2704.3s)]
*  And I couldn't control it all [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpOp1PkiOD4&t=2710.2200000000003s)]
*  Um [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpOp1PkiOD4&t=2714.3s)]
*  And so for me I started to have to get a higher power I had to get a higher power that helps me [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpOp1PkiOD4&t=2716.3s)]
*  It's not it's out of my control [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpOp1PkiOD4&t=2721.1s)]
*  Oh and thank god it is because I can't control everything [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpOp1PkiOD4&t=2724.2200000000003s)]
*  And I was trying to [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpOp1PkiOD4&t=2729.02s)]
*  And now it's like hey god, that's your job you do it [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpOp1PkiOD4&t=2731.82s)]
*  You're doing it. Anyway, i'm just pretending I am and it's causing me a lot of frustration [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpOp1PkiOD4&t=2735.74s)]
*  So those are some things that help me [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpOp1PkiOD4&t=2742.62s)]
*  But i'd love some suggestions actually for hunter and we can put those at the end of um an upcoming solo episode [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpOp1PkiOD4&t=2745.02s)]

*  What else has been happening with me [[00:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpOp1PkiOD4&t=3537.24s)]

*  um [[00:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpOp1PkiOD4&t=3555.8799999999997s)]
*  So it's not a huge time commitment and [[00:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpOp1PkiOD4&t=3557.08s)]
*  It's like a new thing. I didn't want to do it [[00:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpOp1PkiOD4&t=3560.4399999999996s)]
*  uh [[00:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpOp1PkiOD4&t=3563.56s)]
*  But i'm trying to do contrary actions and do things. I don't want to do [[00:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpOp1PkiOD4&t=3564.68s)]
*  Because sometimes I get so set in my comfort zone like oh i'm you know, i'm doing this i'm doing that [[00:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpOp1PkiOD4&t=3569.48s)]
*  And and my life just go in a certain way [[00:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpOp1PkiOD4&t=3574.84s)]
*  and [[00:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpOp1PkiOD4&t=3578.52s)]
*  And I want my life to be different, but I keep doing the same things [[00:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpOp1PkiOD4&t=3580.28s)]
*  And so i'm like if I want to have different feelings and stuff and different experiences. I have to do them [[00:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpOp1PkiOD4&t=3584.68s)]
*  And sometimes I don't like doing new stuff I don't [[00:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpOp1PkiOD4&t=3593.0s)]
*  Really want to try it. I you know, sometimes that stuff scares me, you know, I like to be [[00:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpOp1PkiOD4&t=3595.88s)]
*  In control [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpOp1PkiOD4&t=3603.0800000000004s)]
*  I like to know the outcome of things or I liked, you know somebody will invite me to a movie and they'll take [[01:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpOp1PkiOD4&t=3604.6000000000004s)]
*  I want to go see me. I'm like, what's it what's it gonna be like? I'll text stuff back like that [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpOp1PkiOD4&t=3610.36s)]
*  What's it? What the fuck is it gonna be like me? It's like a fucking movie, you know [[01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpOp1PkiOD4&t=3615.0800000000004s)]
*  And i'm like, who's gonna be there? Like who the fuck is fucking dark? [[01:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpOp1PkiOD4&t=3619.4s)]
*  It's dark in there [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpOp1PkiOD4&t=3623.72s)]
*  And people's fucking hiding and eating damn jujubes dog who gives a shit who's it, you know, but it's like I want to know everything [[01:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpOp1PkiOD4&t=3625.48s)]
*  I find that a lot for myself. I've always I want to know how everything's gonna go [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpOp1PkiOD4&t=3634.84s)]
*  So I can be okay [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpOp1PkiOD4&t=3642.2s)]
*  Because if I know how everything's you know, there's not going to be any real surprise then I can do you know [[01:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpOp1PkiOD4&t=3647.56s)]
*  I'm in control. It gives me some sense of control [[01:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpOp1PkiOD4&t=3652.52s)]
*  But what it takes away from me it takes possibility [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpOp1PkiOD4&t=3656.92s)]
*  And you can't really have a lot of fun if you don't have a lot of possibility [[01:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpOp1PkiOD4&t=3661.5600000000004s)]
*  You know, that's where fun happens that's where something new happens it's you know [[01:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpOp1PkiOD4&t=3668.44s)]
*  And I think I used to be more relaxed and more open about that but when my life got real busy I got real scared [[01:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpOp1PkiOD4&t=3675.08s)]
*  You know and and I just I was like I just [[01:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpOp1PkiOD4&t=3687.48s)]
*  I don't know. I got real scared and I didn't know how to can and the only thing I knew how to do was I just I need [[01:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpOp1PkiOD4&t=3691.32s)]
*  To tighten down on control. I got to control everything [[01:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpOp1PkiOD4&t=3696.92s)]
*  Tighten down on control I got to control everything [[01:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpOp1PkiOD4&t=3700.92s)]
*  Anyway, I don't even know what I was talking about but [[01:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpOp1PkiOD4&t=3707.48s)]
*  Yeah, that's just been what's been going on with me so i've been trying to be braver and try new things [[01:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpOp1PkiOD4&t=3711.48s)]

*  And do things that could be different [[01:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpOp1PkiOD4&t=3719.6400000000003s)]
*  And the funny thing is once I even agreed to do my buddy's project, uh, I felt suddenly more excited [[01:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpOp1PkiOD4&t=3722.2000000000003s)]

*  It's been remixed by people doing sex and making a new person [[01:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpOp1PkiOD4&t=3965.18s)]
*  But this heartbeat this is [[01:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpOp1PkiOD4&t=3970.22s)]
*  I'm this is my fucking you know, this is the same fucking beat that went through my father [[01:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpOp1PkiOD4&t=3972.9399999999996s)]
*  And my grandfather and on up [[01:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpOp1PkiOD4&t=3979.1s)]
*  I had a tough time with my own family growing up and we were not very close [[01:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpOp1PkiOD4&t=3982.7s)]
*  and [[01:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpOp1PkiOD4&t=3988.62s)]
*  There wasn't a ton of education about [[01:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpOp1PkiOD4&t=3989.58s)]
*  The grandparents and the family history there wasn't a ton of it. Um, and I think that some of that [[01:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpOp1PkiOD4&t=3993.74s)]
*  Uh, you know, I always wanted to be different. I wanted to do my own thing [[01:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpOp1PkiOD4&t=4001.1s)]
*  um [[01:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpOp1PkiOD4&t=4007.34s)]
*  So I think as I get over more of that like resentment [[01:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpOp1PkiOD4&t=4010.7s)]
*  Um, I noticed my own family connections growing stronger these days [[01:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpOp1PkiOD4&t=4016.22s)]
*  um [[01:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpOp1PkiOD4&t=4020.94s)]
*  That I I hope to have a a greater [[01:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpOp1PkiOD4&t=4022.7799999999997s)]
*  knowledge of [[01:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpOp1PkiOD4&t=4026.94s)]
*  And not only a knowledge of but a care for [[01:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpOp1PkiOD4&t=4029.02s)]
*  And a care to explore where i'm from [[01:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpOp1PkiOD4&t=4034.7000000000003s)]
*  And what's inside of me what i'm made up of [[01:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpOp1PkiOD4&t=4038.62s)]
*  Um [[01:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpOp1PkiOD4&t=4042.62s)]
*  But yeah, I think there's sometimes you know, sometimes i'll see a little rabbit go by or something and i'll feel a little [[01:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpOp1PkiOD4&t=4048.2200000000003s)]
*  That native american kind of tingle in me [[01:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpOp1PkiOD4&t=4053.26s)]
*  You know, um [[01:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpOp1PkiOD4&t=4056.3s)]
*  I feel a connection to louisiana [[01:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpOp1PkiOD4&t=4059.1s)]
*  I feel a connection to covington where i'm from and that just the you know, I I realize that [[01:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpOp1PkiOD4&t=4061.1s)]
*  I love to tell the stories about my youth and [[01:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpOp1PkiOD4&t=4066.7000000000003s)]
*  And stories are important because that's how we learn a lot of things [[01:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpOp1PkiOD4&t=4070.94s)]
*  Um, you know, that's how you instill a lot of like uh the past in the people [[01:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpOp1PkiOD4&t=4075.1s)]
*  Um [[01:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpOp1PkiOD4&t=4081.5s)]
*  So, yeah, it's interesting. I I don't I feel a connection [[01:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpOp1PkiOD4&t=4082.62s)]
*  But [[01:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpOp1PkiOD4&t=4085.9s)]
*  I I would like to have more [[01:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpOp1PkiOD4&t=4089.1800000000003s)]
*  You know, I would like to have more [[01:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpOp1PkiOD4&t=4093.26s)]
*  um [[01:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpOp1PkiOD4&t=4096.3s)]
*  But for now, I think i'm just working on the gratitude [[01:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpOp1PkiOD4&t=4099.02s)]
*  That I didn't get here alone [[01:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpOp1PkiOD4&t=4103.82s)]
*  You know that I didn't do [[01:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpOp1PkiOD4&t=4109.74s)]
*  You know [[01:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpOp1PkiOD4&t=4112.3s)]
*  That I didn't do [[01:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpOp1PkiOD4&t=4113.82s)]
*  Or create me by myself [[01:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpOp1PkiOD4&t=4115.82s)]
*  um [[01:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpOp1PkiOD4&t=4118.139999999999s)]
*  You know, I think i've had resentments in some of that space and so I gotta [[01:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpOp1PkiOD4&t=4121.099999999999s)]
*  uh, i'm still working through some of that stuff and um [[01:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpOp1PkiOD4&t=4125.42s)]
*  And that's okay [[01:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpOp1PkiOD4&t=4129.66s)]
*  You know, but I think that's an interesting question [[01:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpOp1PkiOD4&t=4131.099999999999s)]
*  And I think it's important [[01:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpOp1PkiOD4&t=4133.82s)]
*  You know, I think it is really important because [[01:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpOp1PkiOD4&t=4136.46s)]
*  If you tell your kid who his grandfather and you introduce this is who he is [[01:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpOp1PkiOD4&t=4139.42s)]
*  And this is what he did [[01:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpOp1PkiOD4&t=4143.98s)]
*  And this is who your great grandfather was and this your great grandmother and this is what she did [[01:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpOp1PkiOD4&t=4146.139999999999s)]
*  You know, that's because then they have a history they have a meaning there's a purpose [[01:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpOp1PkiOD4&t=4152.38s)]
*  Oh, i'm a part of a chain. I'm part of a something [[01:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpOp1PkiOD4&t=4156.94s)]
*  You know [[01:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpOp1PkiOD4&t=4160.7s)]
*  I think that that stuff used to be huge probably like in a lot of native uh cultures and in other societies [[01:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpOp1PkiOD4&t=4162.38s)]
*  It might be really big and in some other families in our family. It was not [[01:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpOp1PkiOD4&t=4168.46s)]
*  There was not a lot of uh, sharing stories [[01:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpOp1PkiOD4&t=4173.66s)]
*  of uh the past [[01:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpOp1PkiOD4&t=4177.74s)]
*  You know, um, and I think my father had some [[01:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpOp1PkiOD4&t=4180.139999999999s)]
*  I mean he grew up in a village, you know, he said that there were [[01:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpOp1PkiOD4&t=4184.3s)]
*  People eating dirt in his village that people starved [[01:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpOp1PkiOD4&t=4187.34s)]
*  um [[01:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpOp1PkiOD4&t=4190.54s)]
*  but I [[01:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpOp1PkiOD4&t=4191.98s)]
*  We were kind of ships passing in the night [[01:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpOp1PkiOD4&t=4193.66s)]
*  In our ages and our ability to connect so [[01:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpOp1PkiOD4&t=4196.62s)]
*  um [[01:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpOp1PkiOD4&t=4199.82s)]
*  Yeah, I don't know. That's a really interesting question though [[01:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpOp1PkiOD4&t=4202.54s)]
*  But I do think it's important because then a kid doesn't feel like he's just here [[01:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpOp1PkiOD4&t=4205.9s)]
*  You know if he knows where he's from if he knows his lineage if he knows [[01:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpOp1PkiOD4&t=4211.5s)]
*  Who was before him and what they believed and what they were? [[01:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpOp1PkiOD4&t=4216.139999999999s)]
*  um [[01:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpOp1PkiOD4&t=4221.66s)]
*  I think that's really valuable stuff [[01:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpOp1PkiOD4&t=4223.58s)]
*  Uh, I don't have a lot of that stuff in me. Um [[01:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpOp1PkiOD4&t=4226.0599999999995s)]
*  but [[01:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpOp1PkiOD4&t=4230.139999999999s)]
*  I hope to gain more and I hope to if I have a family of my own, uh [[01:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpOp1PkiOD4&t=4231.42s)]
*  To have more information to pass on [[01:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpOp1PkiOD4&t=4236.86s)]

*  That's always a goal of mine [[01:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpOp1PkiOD4&t=4290.78s)]
*  And that's something that even comes back to me more, uh, the better I feel [[01:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpOp1PkiOD4&t=4292.86s)]
*  You know, it's like man if i'm feeling good then I can really be a part of this and uh, [[01:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpOp1PkiOD4&t=4297.179999999999s)]

*  You know that boo boo [[01:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpOp1PkiOD4&t=4320.56s)]
*  I grew up in a two-story house and that was a totally [[01:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpOp1PkiOD4&t=4322.64s)]
*  Valid excuse to not have to do something. You just yell i'm upstairs [[01:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpOp1PkiOD4&t=4326.3s)]
*  So I started telling my seven-year-old this we don't have any stairs in our house [[01:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpOp1PkiOD4&t=4330.56s)]
*  But every time he wants me to do something and I don't feel like doing it for him [[01:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpOp1PkiOD4&t=4334.72s)]

*  We're just trying to stay upstairs, aren't we? [[01:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpOp1PkiOD4&t=4400.82s)]
*  I think that's it [[01:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpOp1PkiOD4&t=4403.78s)]
*  You know things are going to get risky, you know things are just trying to stay above it [[01:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpOp1PkiOD4&t=4405.78s)]
*  You know or beside it or just you know, just trying to get stuck in the sludge [[01:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpOp1PkiOD4&t=4411.139999999999s)]
*  And try to take care of ourselves and take care of one another too [[01:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpOp1PkiOD4&t=4416.58s)]

*  But yeah, take care of yourself. It's important, you know that we've created this society that [[01:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpOp1PkiOD4&t=4431.06s)]
*  There feels like so much pressure, you know, it feels like we don't even exist sometimes anymore [[01:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpOp1PkiOD4&t=4439.22s)]
*  um [[01:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpOp1PkiOD4&t=4445.7s)]
*  But I don't know if I don't know if that's real or if that's just [[01:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpOp1PkiOD4&t=4447.9400000000005s)]
*  A side effect of something we've created [[01:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpOp1PkiOD4&t=4452.74s)]
*  um [[01:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpOp1PkiOD4&t=4456.74s)]

*  uh [[01:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpOp1PkiOD4&t=4460.9s)]
*  That we are important [[01:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpOp1PkiOD4&t=4462.98s)]
*  And that we do matter [[01:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpOp1PkiOD4&t=4465.3s)]
*  and that [[01:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpOp1PkiOD4&t=4467.7s)]
*  There is purpose [[01:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpOp1PkiOD4&t=4468.9s)]
