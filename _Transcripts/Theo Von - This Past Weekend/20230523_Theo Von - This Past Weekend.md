*  There was a whole time she was on, [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=2190.2200000000003s)]
*  she's been doing, she was going through it all. [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=2192.2200000000003s)]
*  She was on, there was a period of time. [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=2194.5s)]
*  No shit. [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=2195.82s)]
*  No, but there was a period of time [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=2197.86s)]
*  where she was doing meth or something [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=2199.02s)]
*  and she thought, she shaved her head, [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=2201.26s)]
*  she shaved it cause. [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=2202.86s)]
*  Oh wow. [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=2203.7000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, she thought there was people talking to her. [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=2204.54s)]
*  It was sad. [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=2205.7400000000002s)]
*  But then she like, she dropped off her TV at my house, [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=2206.58s)]
*  all of her phones. [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=2210.2200000000003s)]
*  She's like, they're listening. [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=2211.54s)]
*  You gotta take it. [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=2212.6600000000003s)]
*  She was deep, huh? [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=2213.5s)]
*  Yeah, she was deep. [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=2214.34s)]
*  But she's good now, but it was crazy to watch. [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=2215.26s)]
*  But she's blackfishing sober. [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=2218.98s)]
*  And so blackfishing is when you try to go to the black side. [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=2220.74s)]
*  You try to be black. [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=2223.7s)]
*  I think, yeah. [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=2224.9s)]
*  Or you want to be perceived as black. [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=2225.94s)]
*  But then if anyone were to be racist, [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=2227.9s)]
*  you'd be like, take a makeup wipe and be like, I'm white. [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=2229.42s)]
*  Oh, I see what you're saying. [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=2232.42s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=2233.5s)]
*  Yeah, I used to, I think sometimes, man, [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=2234.7s)]
*  when I was young, I related to a lot of the black kids [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=2236.06s)]
*  so much I would. [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=2238.2599999999998s)]
*  But then when it came down to it, [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=2240.74s)]
*  one time me and my friend Devin, we were fishing [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=2242.2599999999998s)]
*  and he was black and some white guy was throwing rocks [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=2245.2599999999998s)]
*  up from this railroad track down by us [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=2250.18s)]
*  who were fishing on this bank. [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=2251.7s)]
*  And he started calling us the N word, right? [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=2253.14s)]
*  And I was like, not me. [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=2255.98s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=2257.66s)]
*  Just Devin. [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=2258.5s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=2259.3399999999997s)]
*  Like, I was down with Devin until that part. [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=2260.18s)]
*  And then I realized, I mean, fuck the guy throwing rocks. [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=2264.1s)]
*  The guy's a piece of shit. [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=2267.18s)]
*  But at the same time, like- [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=2268.66s)]
*  That ain't me. [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=2270.2599999999998s)]
*  Yeah, don't include. [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=2271.1s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=2271.9399999999996s)]
*  That's when I realized I'm only there, you know. [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=2273.22s)]
*  He was my friend and I was gonna rock with him, but- [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=2275.94s)]
*  So you wouldn't blackfish. [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=2278.4199999999996s)]
*  I wouldn't blackfish, yeah. [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=2279.8199999999997s)]
*  I would fish with blacks. [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=2281.14s)]
*  Sorry, I stepped on your joke. [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=2283.5s)]
*  Yeah, that's okay. [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=2284.62s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=2285.46s)]
*  I didn't realize it. [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=2286.62s)]
*  That's a funny joke. [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=2287.46s)]
*  Yeah, that's a good one. [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=2288.2999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, so you wouldn't blackfish, no. [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=2289.62s)]
*  No, but I would- [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=2291.22s)]
*  Fish with the blacks. [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=2292.98s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=2294.74s)]
*  Wait, what's it like hanging out with comics? [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=2295.62s)]
*  Are comics cool? [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=2297.8199999999997s)]
*  You like them? [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=2299.58s)]
*  You like yourself? [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=2301.2599999999998s)]
*  I don't know about that. [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=2303.3799999999997s)]
*  Let's start with other people. [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=2304.8199999999997s)]
*  That's safe. [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=2306.22s)]
*  Let me think. [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=2307.8199999999997s)]
*  Do I like hanging out with comics? [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=2308.66s)]
*  Yeah, I think comics are intrinsically kind of lonely, [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=2309.8199999999997s)]
*  or do they do a lot of stuff by themselves? [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=2312.8599999999997s)]
*  So I think- [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=2315.54s)]
*  Well, yeah, I feel like comics always want this big, [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=2317.2599999999998s)]
*  oh, we're so dark and sad and lonely, [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=2319.94s)]
*  but are they? [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=2322.7799999999997s)]
*  Every single one of them? [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=2323.74s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=2325.54s)]
*  I think a lot of them probably have a lot of strange stuff [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=2326.8999999999996s)]
*  or weird things that they ended up needing [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=2331.62s)]
*  to go get people to look at them. [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=2334.42s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=2336.46s)]
*  Yeah, I think so. [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=2338.8199999999997s)]
*  So I think some of them probably have some dark stuff [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=2339.94s)]
*  like that, you know? [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=2341.9s)]
*  I bet some of them probably have some pretty dark things. [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=2343.02s)]
*  So I think there's probably some truth to that, [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=2345.7s)]
*  but I think also now there's a lot more people [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=2347.5s)]
*  that are funny from TikTok, from short clips, [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=2351.94s)]
*  from different things like that. [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=2354.1s)]
*  So I think you're getting a lot more [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=2356.1s)]
*  I don't even know if, [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=2362.3399999999997s)]
*  like, I don't know if there's as many, [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=2364.94s)]
*  if I'm starting out now as a comedian, [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=2368.14s)]
*  I wonder, do I try and get on stage, [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=2370.46s)]
*  which is where you learn to be a comedian, right? [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=2373.2599999999998s)]
*  Or do I just try and get in front of my phone? [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=2376.18s)]
*  That's true. [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=2379.46s)]
*  Well, also, because you do stand up and everything, [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=2380.2999999999997s)]
*  do you like respect the people that start on TikTok? [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=2383.42s)]
*  Because I know a lot of stand up comics that are like, [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=2386.2999999999997s)]
*  they hate people that start on TikTok [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=2388.18s)]
*  and then bring a crowd to a show. [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=2389.86s)]
*  That's a good question. [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=2393.1400000000003s)]
*  I remember I got jealous when there was a lot of YouTubers. [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=2393.98s)]
*  There was like Roman Atwood, [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=2396.94s)]
*  Dennis, Roman and Dennis were part of Dennis Rodey, [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=2402.1s)]
*  FouseyTube, some of those guys were touring [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=2407.38s)]
*  and going to comedy clubs, right? [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=2410.34s)]
*  And they would do their shows during the day even, [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=2411.9s)]
*  a lot of times. [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=2414.02s)]
*  And I was envious, really. [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=2415.1800000000003s)]
*  I mean, I was jealous, you know, [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=2417.02s)]
*  because they were having more success. [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=2419.02s)]
*  You had comics, you've been on the road for like nine years [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=2421.7400000000002s)]
*  going to these clubs and then these guys were showing up [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=2423.86s)]
*  and having their audience come see them at a comedy club. [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=2426.86s)]
*  So I think that's what made it a little strange for us. [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=2430.82s)]
*  So it's the comedy club. [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=2433.22s)]
*  Well, it was like, oh, you're doing it at our space. [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=2434.46s)]
*  But those clubs just happened to be kind of the size [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=2438.06s)]
*  for the audiences they were bringing. [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=2440.66s)]
*  So I never really thought about why there was like, [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=2443.5s)]
*  in the beginning, there was like some angst towards, [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=2447.1s)]
*  for me anyway, and I think a lot of people felt that way, [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=2450.14s)]
*  a lot of comedians felt that way. [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=2452.14s)]
*  There was angst towards some of the vloggers. [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=2453.74s)]
*  Yeah, for sure. [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=2456.46s)]
*  It was like, fuck, they're son of my club [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=2457.2999999999997s)]
*  for like a five o'clock show [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=2459.38s)]
*  because some of their audience would be children. [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=2460.54s)]
*  So they do a daytime show, yeah. [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=2462.7s)]
*  And then they do a daytime show. [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=2464.9s)]
*  But were they doing comedy though? [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=2467.2599999999998s)]
*  Or they were just getting up there and? [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=2468.82s)]
*  They would get up on stage and like shoot a T-shirt can [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=2470.42s)]
*  and or something, you know? [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=2472.7799999999997s)]
*  Okay. [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=2474.58s)]
*  Or fucking, you know, or do like a cheer. [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=2475.54s)]
*  I don't know what they were doing. [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=2477.7s)]
*  Yeah, like body rolls and shit. [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=2478.62s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=2479.86s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=2481.66s)]
*  Yeah, they were doing body rolls, dude. [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=2484.02s)]
*  Which is way weird to do for a fucking bunch of children. [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=2486.46s)]
*  So weird. [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=2489.14s)]
*  They still do that. [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=2490.5s)]
*  It's crazy, it's crazy. [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=2491.58s)]
*  I guess there's people still body rolling on. [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=2494.9s)]
*  Oh, they're still body rolling. [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=2497.02s)]
*  Why? [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=2498.18s)]
*  I don't know, cause it sells. [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=2499.22s)]
*  It works, I mean, look, look at them. [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=2501.38s)]
*  They were selling out the comedy store and it works. [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=2503.34s)]
*  You were up there all mad. [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=2506.7400000000002s)]
*  That's true. [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=2508.86s)]
*  And I was outside, I was waiting for my show, [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=2509.7000000000003s)]
*  which was at seven o'clock that nobody was coming to. [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=2510.98s)]
*  I'm like, these motherfuckers. [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=2513.46s)]
*  You're out there, you're hitting it on the streets [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=2514.78s)]
*  on the body rolls. [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=2516.86s)]
*  So yeah, yeah. [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=2517.7000000000003s)]
*  Like it doesn't look natural. [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=2519.5s)]
*  Little Met Nelly. [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=2521.1000000000004s)]
*  So I think there could be some angst about it. [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=2522.5800000000004s)]
*  I think at that time there was probably some angst about it. [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=2530.02s)]
*  But now I think that it's almost like you go there first. [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=2532.5s)]
*  A lot of comedians aren't thinking [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=2537.5s)]
*  that you go to the stage first. [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=2538.82s)]
*  I think there's some, if you're a comedian right now [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=2540.34s)]
*  who's working really hard in the clubs [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=2544.34s)]
*  but you're having trouble with social media, [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=2546.54s)]
*  it must be extremely frustrating. [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=2547.7000000000003s)]
*  I'd be mad. [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=2551.42s)]
*  Because there's, well, I mean, a lot of the standup comics [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=2552.46s)]
*  that do like TikTok first, they just have their few clips [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=2554.94s)]
*  that go viral and then people will come see them [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=2558.34s)]
*  and they won't be funny. [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=2560.1800000000003s)]
*  Right. [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=2562.5s)]
*  That's another problem I think is scary [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=2563.54s)]
*  if you get more popular than where you can support it [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=2565.58s)]
*  with your own comedy. [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=2568.1800000000003s)]
*  Yeah, I see that a lot. [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=2569.06s)]
*  You do? [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=2570.98s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=2571.82s)]
*  I see a bunch of people, because I follow, [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=2573.1800000000003s)]
*  I mean, I'm friends with a bunch of influencers [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=2575.34s)]
*  and TikTokers, so I'll follow them on TikTok [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=2576.78s)]
*  and I'll see their standup on TikTok [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=2579.26s)]
*  and then you go see them. [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=2580.9s)]
*  And it's like those same jokes that went viral. [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=2582.46s)]
*  That's like their two big hits in the show [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=2584.6600000000003s)]
*  and the rest is just like a lull. [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=2586.26s)]
*  But I think some people, I don't even know [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=2589.2200000000003s)]
*  if like a real young audience, if they even know [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=2591.06s)]
*  that there is this whole standup comedy thing [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=2594.7s)]
*  or do they just think I'm gonna go see these two hits, [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=2596.66s)]
*  I'm gonna have a blast while I'm there, [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=2599.22s)]
*  I'm gonna capture it on my phone, on socials, [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=2601.02s)]
*  and then that's gonna be that. [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=2603.98s)]
*  Well, yeah, they must not, [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=2605.18s)]
*  because they keep going. [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=2606.02s)]
*  The lines are around the block and stuff. [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=2607.02s)]
*  So I guess like a live podcast is what they think it is. [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=2608.58s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=2611.82s)]
*  But there's something really special about seeing, [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=2613.54s)]
*  if there's somebody you watch on TikTok and social media [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=2618.3s)]
*  and you enjoy them, right? [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=2620.7400000000002s)]
*  There's somebody on a podcast or something. [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=2621.58s)]
*  I've sat in the audience, I've sat in the audience before [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=2623.6600000000003s)]
*  and been like, oh man, this is so cool. [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=2626.78s)]
*  I watch this guy, I'm involved in their life or this girl [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=2628.42s)]
*  and then I get to be in the same room as them. [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=2630.94s)]
*  Sometimes there's part of it, [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=2633.98s)]
*  it doesn't really matter what they're saying. [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=2634.94s)]
*  It'd be great if the material is also great, [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=2637.62s)]
*  but just being in the same room as them, [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=2640.02s)]
*  it's almost like you get a moment in reality. [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=2641.62s)]
*  It's cool. [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=2646.1s)]
*  It's cool. [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=2646.94s)]
*  Because they're always on a screen [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=2647.78s)]
*  and they're right in front of you. [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=2648.6s)]
*  It's like, oh, this is cool. [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=2649.6s)]
*  It's kind of like you for me right now. [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=2650.44s)]
*  It's true, right? [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=2652.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=2653.12s)]
*  Yeah, because we never even seen each other. [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=2653.94s)]
*  I felt like I was like, this morning I was like, [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=2654.78s)]
*  yeah, I can't remember the last time that I saw this lady. [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=2657.16s)]
*  And then I was like, oh, I never saw this lady. [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=2659.84s)]
*  You never saw this lady. [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=2661.68s)]
*  Yeah, I tell you. [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=2662.52s)]
*  I never saw her. [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=2663.36s)]
*  I kind of felt the same way. [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=2665.92s)]
*  I was like, I feel like I saw this guy before, [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=2667.08s)]
*  but I never saw this guy before. [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=2669.76s)]
*  Yeah, I never saw this guy. [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=2670.84s)]
*  No. [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=2671.96s)]
*  But I know some of your, even just watching you, [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=2672.8s)]
*  like I see some of your mannerisms are the same, [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=2674.84s)]
*  but which makes sense because that's you. [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=2677.52s)]
*  Okay, so what happened then? [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=2681.44s)]
*  You were in high school. [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=2682.78s)]
*  Oh, I was in high school. [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=2684.2599999999998s)]
*  And you got a boyfriend in your senior year. [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=2685.32s)]
*  Did y'all fall in love, you think? [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=2688.48s)]
*  Oh, and then you moved to Ohio for the man. [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=2689.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=2691.5s)]
*  Wow, so you were in love then. [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=2692.34s)]

*  because it was darker down there. [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=3147.1200000000003s)]

*  is when my mom would let me sit in the back seat. [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=3153.52s)]
*  But like when we would travel together, [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=3156.1200000000003s)]
*  usually I would sit in the front seat [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=3157.44s)]
*  and my mom would sit in the back [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=3158.8s)]
*  and my dad would drive. [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=3159.92s)]
*  But when my mom sat in the front, I was like, [[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=3161.04s)]

*  For sex? [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=3607.28s)]
*  That leaves me with Glennie for sex, yeah. [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=3608.44s)]
*  It's not bad though. [[01:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=3611.6s)]
*  No, it's not bad. [[01:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=3612.44s)]
*  What would you do? [[01:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=3613.28s)]
*  It's a summer sausage thing, you know? [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=3614.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=3615.56s)]

*  Yeah. [[01:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=3619.08s)]
*  Not on the end of that. [[01:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=3619.92s)]
*  I, I, I'm married, I don't know. [[01:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=3621.6s)]
*  I don't think Dave and I would get along that well [[01:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=3625.96s)]
*  if we were married. [[01:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=3627.72s)]
*  No? [[01:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=3628.6s)]
*  No. [[01:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=3629.44s)]
*  What would you butt heads about, you think? [[01:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=3630.2799999999997s)]
*  And I, I just think, I mean, I admire Dave. [[01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=3632.6s)]
*  I look at Dave honestly as a kind of like a Paul Revere [[01:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=3638.16s)]
*  type of figure. [[01:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=3640.52s)]
*  He really, he, you know. [[01:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=3641.84s)]
*  He's crazy. [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=3643.0s)]
*  He's crazy, but he says what he wants to say. [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=3643.84s)]
*  And he stands up for, he stands by on what he wants to say. [[01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=3646.36s)]
*  If he makes mistakes, he makes mistakes. [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=3648.72s)]
*  But he's brave in that sense. [[01:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=3650.6s)]
*  I really admire that about him. [[01:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=3652.24s)]
*  I'm team Dave. [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=3653.68s)]
*  I love Dave. [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=3654.52s)]
*  So, yeah, but I don't think we could be, [[01:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=3655.44s)]
*  I mean, I don't want to be married to a man either. [[01:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=3659.24s)]
*  So this game fucking sucks, bro. [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=3662.12s)]
*  I mean, yeah, for me too. [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=3664.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=3666.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=3667.08s)]
*  But at least you got a man on the other end of it. [[01:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=3667.92s)]
*  You know? [[01:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=3670.2s)]
*  I guess that's true. [[01:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=3671.04s)]
*  Maybe Frank, I don't know if Frank, [[01:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=3673.12s)]
*  what is like kind of habits are at the house. [[01:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=3675.16s)]
*  I think he's tidy. [[01:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=3678.36s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=3680.72s)]
*  You think so? [[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=3682.52s)]
*  You think? [[01:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=3683.3599999999997s)]
*  He did a live stream from his apartment, [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=3684.2s)]
*  but it's when he first got it. [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=3686.2799999999997s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[01:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=3687.7999999999997s)]
*  He got a dishwasher. [[01:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=3689.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=3691.2799999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=3692.12s)]
*  But that's, yeah, it is nice. [[01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=3692.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=3695.72s)]
*  I like having a good dishwasher. [[01:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=3696.56s)]
*  Let me think. [[01:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=3697.4s)]
*  I would probably kill, I don't want to have sex with Dave [[01:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=3698.22s)]
*  because I've seen some of his sex videos [[01:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=3701.44s)]
*  and some of it seems like. [[01:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=3702.7599999999998s)]
*  Too much. [[01:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=3704.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=3705.56s)]
*  Too much. [[01:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=3706.4s)]
*  It just seems a lot, especially if I'm a man [[01:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=3707.22s)]
*  and he's a man. [[01:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=3708.2799999999997s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[01:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=3709.16s)]
*  Like if you do the body math, [[01:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=3710.0s)]
*  it's going to be a fucking, it's going to be, [[01:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=3712.3599999999997s)]
*  it's going to be a weird equation. [[01:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=3714.56s)]
*  So I don't want that. [[01:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=3716.08s)]
*  I don't think I want to be a part of that. [[01:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=3717.44s)]
*  Okay. [[01:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=3719.08s)]
*  So kill him? [[01:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=3719.92s)]
*  I'd have to, I guess I would have to kill him maybe. [[01:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=3720.7599999999998s)]
*  Okay. [[01:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=3722.48s)]
*  And then I'd probably marry Glennie. [[01:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=3723.7599999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=3726.88s)]
*  And then I'd smash big Frank. [[01:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=3727.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=3728.54s)]
*  You rather, okay. [[01:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=3729.6s)]
*  I would just fuck that guy. [[01:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=3731.64s)]
*  So would you smash him? [[01:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=3732.48s)]
*  I think I'd have to. [[01:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=3733.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=3735.04s)]
*  You know? [[01:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=3735.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=3737.6s)]
*  I mean, that's not bad. [[01:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=3738.44s)]
*  I don't think so. [[01:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=3739.32s)]
*  And I don't know him either. [[01:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=3740.2400000000002s)]
*  So it could be like, you know, you blindfold everybody. [[01:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=3741.32s)]
*  Everybody. [[01:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=3744.4s)]
*  Me and him. [[01:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=3745.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=3746.92s)]
*  But it seems like there's a lot of him. [[01:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=3747.76s)]
*  I think that's why I said that, [[01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=3749.48s)]
*  but yeah, I think you blindfold everybody [[01:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=3750.68s)]
*  and then you just kind of hope for the best. [[01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=3753.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=3755.52s)]
*  No, he's yeah. [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=3756.36s)]
*  He screams a lot. [[01:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=3757.18s)]
*  He's crazy. [[01:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=3758.02s)]
*  He's kind of crazy. [[01:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=3758.86s)]
*  So yeah, I think I would just be in and out of there. [[01:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=3760.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=3762.88s)]
*  It's hit it and quit it. [[01:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=3763.7200000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=3764.84s)]
*  And quit heavy on the quit it. [[01:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=3765.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=3766.88s)]
*  Keep him blindfolded. [[01:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=3767.8799999999997s)]
*  Get out of there. [[01:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=3768.7999999999997s)]
*  So, okay. [[01:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=3769.8399999999997s)]
*  So you quit working at the, [[01:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=3771.6s)]
*  so then did you quit college completely [[01:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=3774.3999999999996s)]
*  and then how did you get over to New York? [[01:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=3776.16s)]
*  Yeah, I was still in school when the bar stool [[01:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=3778.24s)]
*  gave me an internship. [[01:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=3780.8399999999997s)]

*  You go? [[01:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=3921.36s)]
*  We used to go all the time. [[01:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=3922.2s)]
*  It was like the place we would fucking go, boy. [[01:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=3923.56s)]
*  It's where I learned everything. [[01:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=3926.04s)]
*  Yeah, I used to get a day pass. [[01:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=3927.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=3929.56s)]
*  Oh, the poor moms would drop their kids off [[01:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=3930.44s)]
*  at the fucking YMCA. [[01:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=3932.4s)]
*  You would walk between there [[01:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=3933.84s)]
*  and they would kick you out of there [[01:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=3934.84s)]
*  and then you have to go to the library. [[01:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=3935.68s)]
*  I remember being in the library and being like, [[01:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=3937.92s)]
*  where can we swim? [[01:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=3939.12s)]
*  And they're like, this is a fucking library. [[01:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=3940.16s)]
*  I would sneak into the back with the daycare, [[01:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=3941.96s)]
*  but it's like 11 year old kids watching smaller kids [[01:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=3944.44s)]
*  and they all have smocks on for some reason. [[01:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=3949.0s)]
*  So I just walk in and put a smock on. [[01:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=3951.2400000000002s)]
*  I was just there. [[01:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=3953.08s)]
*  And then I would sneak to the pool [[01:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=3954.44s)]
*  and they never let you go off the diving board though. [[01:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=3956.28s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[01:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=3958.4s)]
*  And they shouldn't. [[01:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=3959.36s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[01:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=3960.2000000000003s)]
*  Because you're gonna fucking drown. [[01:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=3961.04s)]
*  Yeah, that's true. [[01:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=3962.6s)]
*  Yeah, especially if the person on the diving board [[01:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=3965.84s)]
*  looks like the same person [[01:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=3967.96s)]
*  who's about to jump off a building. [[01:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=3969.0s)]
*  It's really the same look. [[01:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=3970.36s)]
*  If you ever see somebody about to jump off a building, [[01:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=3971.64s)]
*  I don't know if I should be doing this. [[01:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=3973.64s)]
*  It's the same look as a kid [[01:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=3975.56s)]
*  that shouldn't be going off that board. [[01:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=3976.72s)]
*  He's terrified. [[01:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=3978.16s)]
*  Yeah, dude, the YMCA, man. [[01:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=3980.12s)]
*  I fell in love with a girl there one time [[01:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=3982.3599999999997s)]
*  because she had tits, right? [[01:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=3984.44s)]
*  Nobody had ever seen them. [[01:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=3988.64s)]
*  Ever. [[01:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=3989.7599999999998s)]
*  I mean, none of our friends. [[01:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=3990.6s)]
*  I remember we came like, damn, what's wrong with her? [[01:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=3991.92s)]
*  I think she has cancer on her chest, beautiful cancer. [[01:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=3994.8399999999997s)]
*  Because she just had these, [[01:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=3999.0s)]
*  she had them growths on her. [[01:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=4000.4s)]
*  We'd never seen it. [[01:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=4001.56s)]
*  And she ended up getting killed years later. [[01:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=4003.16s)]
*  Oh. [[01:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=4006.8399999999997s)]
*  I know. [[01:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=4007.68s)]
*  Wasn't cancer? [[01:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=4008.52s)]
*  I don't know what got her. [[01:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=4009.68s)]
*  That'd be crazy if it was, but. [[01:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=4010.6s)]
*  She got murdered or she's... [[01:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=4013.2799999999997s)]
*  What if it was breast cancer that she died of? [[01:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=4015.0s)]
*  I hate to say that because it's very sad [[01:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=4016.88s)]
*  and it takes a lot of people, [[01:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=4018.7999999999997s)]
*  but I wouldn't be shocked if she had so much breast. [[01:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=4019.64s)]
*  How young was she with the breasts? [[01:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=4022.96s)]
*  I mean, I don't know. [[01:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=4024.44s)]
*  We didn't know what they were. [[01:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=4027.3199999999997s)]

*  Yeah, it's like a, [[01:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=4101.08s)]
*  you know on a turkey, whenever it gets warm enough [[01:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=4102.4s)]
*  in that thing pot, it's just like that. [[01:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=4104.04s)]
*  It's like this is, like some of the blood's like, [[01:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=4105.28s)]
*  hey, we found a way. [[01:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=4107.88s)]
*  And it's just like, hey, this is as far as we can go. [[01:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=4108.72s)]
*  You know? [[01:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=4111.08s)]
*  Oh yeah, just, yeah, just an arrow. [[01:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=4111.92s)]
*  That's it. [[01:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=4113.16s)]
*  It's like, yeah, it's basically like over there. [[01:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=4114.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=4115.92s)]

*  Yeah. [[01:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=4117.76s)]
*  So, so that happens, but then there's another, [[01:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=4118.6s)]
*  there's like a visual thing that's kind of happens, I think. [[01:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=4121.360000000001s)]
*  When somebody has breath and you start to see them, you know? [[01:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=4127.04s)]
*  And then you're real kind of, [[01:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=4132.240000000001s)]
*  so there's that thing going on. [[01:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=4133.84s)]
*  I think there's two things, [[01:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=4135.96s)]
*  but I don't know what age it's at. [[01:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=4136.84s)]
*  Just whenever you hit, whenever you hit puberty. [[01:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=4139.04s)]
*  But it can be before that, [[01:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=4142.8s)]
*  if somebody like gets you real visually intrigued. [[01:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=4144.04s)]
*  So you're almost intrigued from like a curious standpoint. [[01:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=4146.52s)]
*  Cause you know, one day you're gonna care. [[01:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=4149.8s)]
*  Right, or you just wonder what's going on here. [[01:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=4152.52s)]
*  Something's changing. [[01:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=4154.72s)]
*  I wanna know, I'm curious what's happening. [[01:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=4155.96s)]
*  And then I was at summer camp and they had a guy [[01:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=4160.72s)]
*  and he was dating one of the counselors. [[01:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=4163.56s)]
*  And like you said, it was through YMCA. [[01:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=4164.8s)]
*  So it was just like, yeah, they're just like the oldest kids [[01:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=4165.88s)]
*  get to fucking watch the other kids, right? [[01:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=4168.040000000001s)]
*  And he would let us look down his girlfriend's shirt [[01:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=4172.52s)]
*  for a little while. [[01:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=4174.76s)]
*  No. [[01:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=4175.6s)]
*  His girlfriend? [[01:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=4177.32s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, he like kind of got off on her [[01:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=4178.16s)]
*  or something at the park. [[01:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=4180.04s)]
*  So I remember, especially if it rained out [[01:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=4181.679999999999s)]
*  and there wasn't anything for us to do, [[01:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=4183.48s)]
*  he'd let us get in line and look. [[01:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=4184.5599999999995s)]
*  Did you look? [[01:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=4186.4s)]

*  It was black and white. [[01:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=4192.36s)]
*  I would look and I was fucking. [[01:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=4193.679999999999s)]
*  You were done. [[01:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=4195.5199999999995s)]
*  I was blinded by my own excitement for it. [[01:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=4196.5199999999995s)]
*  Like, fuck, I'm gonna be like, dude, I didn't see you. [[01:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=4199.879999999999s)]

*  Damn, you were so excited. [[01:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=4208.08s)]

*  We were so excited. [[01:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=4212.360000000001s)]
*  Okay, so what happened then? [[01:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=4214.56s)]
*  So you get, so now you're in New York, you're living there [[01:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=4215.84s)]
*  and who'd you choose to live with [[01:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=4219.320000000001s)]
*  and how'd you find a place? [[01:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=4220.72s)]
*  Well, I moved here during COVID, so no one lived here. [[01:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=4223.08s)]
*  Okay. [[01:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=4226.0s)]
*  So it was the easiest time to move here. [[01:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=4226.84s)]
*  It was scary though, because no one was here. [[01:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=4227.68s)]
*  But apartments were half the price. [[01:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=4229.400000000001s)]
*  So I moved in to the shittiest apartment. [[01:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=4231.76s)]
*  It was disgusting. [[01:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=4234.64s)]
*  There was like cockroaches. [[01:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=4235.76s)]

*  Okay. [[01:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=4418.4s)]
*  And the manager or the assistant manager on Sunday, [[01:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=4419.56s)]
*  he was a BAC, right? [[01:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=4427.36s)]
*  He's born again Christian. [[01:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=4431.44s)]
*  Oh, okay. [[01:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=4432.76s)]
*  So we would do fake orders that came in. [[01:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=4433.6s)]
*  We'd be like, oh, we got a call in from like [[01:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=4437.04s)]
*  Ricky Gervais or something, right? [[01:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=4440.4400000000005s)]
*  In our town, it was like a small town, right? [[01:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=4442.8s)]
*  Like out on like Million Dollar Road, right? [[01:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=4444.320000000001s)]
*  Like they had a place by us called Million Dollar Road. [[01:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=4447.88s)]
*  But it would be like middle of nowhere. [[01:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=4453.120000000001s)]
*  And these were real people, real names. [[01:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=4454.6s)]
*  Celebrities, right? [[01:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=4456.280000000001s)]
*  Okay. [[01:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=4457.200000000001s)]
*  But he didn't know any celebrities [[01:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=4458.04s)]
*  because he was only through the church. [[01:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=4459.08s)]
*  Everything he saw was. [[01:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=4460.400000000001s)]
*  So if you'd have been like Paul the apostle, [[01:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=4461.36s)]
*  down on Main Street, he'd have been like, oh insane, right? [[01:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=4464.24s)]
*  But if you were like Ricky Gervais, he had no idea. [[01:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=4468.04s)]
*  If you were like Sam Elliott, he had no idea. [[01:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=4470.12s)]
*  So he would drive off and go deliver the stuff. [[01:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=4474.16s)]
*  And we would deep fry everything in the place. [[01:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=4477.04s)]
*  Like any type of meats or even pudding. [[01:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=4482.32s)]
*  If you put it in a deep fryer, it'll fry. [[01:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=4485.36s)]
*  So we'd have fried pudding chunks [[01:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=4487.92s)]
*  and be drinking just draft beer. [[01:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=4489.56s)]
*  Oh nice. [[01:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=4491.120000000001s)]

*  Ricky Gervais doesn't want his pie. [[01:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=4499.4800000000005s)]
*  And we were just ripped at that point. [[01:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=4503.92s)]
*  So he would just be yelling like obscenities and shit at him [[01:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=4505.84s)]
*  and he'd get all pissed off at us. [[01:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=4508.76s)]
*  So I worked there. [[01:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=4510.080000000001s)]

*  He's living lavish. [[01:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=5252.82s)]

*  He just got lucky. [[01:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=5268.419999999999s)]
*  Now he's been in the system for a while, [[01:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=5269.62s)]
*  but he was able to, I think, get some horses [[01:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=5271.099999999999s)]
*  that were other grandparents and stuff [[01:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=5272.78s)]

*  because you think the animals could smell it on you, you know? [[01:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=5681.820000000001s)]

*  like tripped out white dudes rolling around. [[01:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=5691.1s)]
*  You just didn't really know what was going on. [[01:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=5693.38s)]
*  There was always somebody cutting their hair [[01:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=5695.42s)]

*  Like I lived in a neighborhood [[01:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=5701.26s)]
*  where everybody would just burn stuff in the ditch, right? [[01:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=5702.18s)]
*  We lived right outside of like the town limit [[01:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=5704.18s)]
*  where you couldn't burn stuff in your ditch, right? [[01:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=5707.34s)]
*  So it was a big thing. [[01:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=5709.66s)]
*  Like people were like, [[01:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=5710.66s)]

*  You couldn't? [[01:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=5713.700000000001s)]
*  We could. [[01:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=5714.54s)]
*  But like four streets over, they couldn't, you know? [[01:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=5715.66s)]
*  And like, look at these city slickers. [[01:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=5717.9800000000005s)]

*  And you were just burning it. [[01:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=5723.98s)]
*  We were just lighting it up. [[01:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=5725.379999999999s)]
*  So I remember that that was kind of interesting. [[01:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=5727.5s)]
*  We had a lot of people that couldn't read [[01:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=5729.94s)]
*  that would just break shit [[01:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=5731.46s)]
*  because they couldn't express themselves. [[01:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=5732.62s)]
*  It's fair. [[01:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=5734.82s)]

*  Oh, they'd have like, [[01:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=5738.9s)]
*  some veterinarian would always drive through our neighborhood [[01:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=5740.94s)]
*  and like they would, [[01:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=5743.7s)]
*  since we're outside of the town limits as well, [[01:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=5745.46s)]
*  they would throw a lot of like the animal carcasses and shit [[01:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=5747.219999999999s)]
*  like out in our yard. [[01:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=5749.78s)]
*  Like the... [[01:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=5750.78s)]

*  like playing games and shit like that. [[01:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=5754.38s)]

*  And they would start digging [[01:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=5762.98s)]
*  and it would be like the shape of some weird animal. [[01:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=5763.82s)]
*  You never even like... [[01:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=5766.179999999999s)]
*  It'd be like a tail and then like one foot [[01:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=5767.7s)]
*  and then into another tail. [[01:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=5769.86s)]
*  And you're like, this animal doesn't make any sense. [[01:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQsWwhyWwM&t=5771.179999999999s)]
