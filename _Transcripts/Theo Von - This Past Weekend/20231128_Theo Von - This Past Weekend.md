*  They should study him. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=412.72s)]
*  It would take about 40 minutes. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=413.72s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=414.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=415.72s)]
*  If you go, well, it would be one. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=416.72s)]
*  There's one extra something. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=418.72s)]
*  That would take a little longer. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=420.72s)]
*  That extra chromosome. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=422.72s)]
*  There's also it must have creatine in it because a lot of people that are, you know, men, you [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=424.72s)]
*  know, a lot of people call them menals or, you know, people that are missing in action [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=432.72s)]
*  but aren't missing. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=438.72s)]
*  Sure, sure, sure, sure, sure, sure. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=439.72s)]
*  Those people are there. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=441.72s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=442.72s)]
*  The the torque that's in them. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=443.72s)]
*  Well, yeah, they're literally more. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=445.72s)]
*  They're one extra amount, dude. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=448.72s)]
*  So they are stronger. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=450.72s)]
*  They're hyper masculine. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=451.72s)]
*  That's that extra chromosome. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=452.72s)]
*  Is that true? [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=453.72s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=454.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=455.72s)]
*  So the extra chromosome is that's one type, one style. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=456.72s)]
*  OK. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=458.72s)]
*  I don't know if it's we're talking downs right now, I believe. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=459.72s)]
*  I had a friend whose whose son had the extra and I think the extra exes girls, why is dudes, [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=462.72s)]
*  I believe. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=469.72s)]
*  So if you're X, Y, Y, that means you're like a turbo bro. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=470.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=473.72s)]
*  So those motherfuckers, hairy, you know, eyebrows, wild, jacked, jacking off fast, you know, at [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=474.72s)]
*  a young age like. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=481.72s)]
*  Oh, they can jack off and then catch it on their eyebrows. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=482.72s)]
*  You know, like we're talking like, yeah. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=486.72s)]
*  It's like hanging up the Christmas lights. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=488.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=490.72s)]
*  Look at Randy. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=491.72s)]
*  An icicle. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=492.72s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=493.72s)]
*  Bells ooo. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=495.72s)]
*  Dude, we had, yeah, we had a uncle, he used to masturbate in his sleep, right? [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=497.72s)]
*  He had a, I think he had an iron deficiency or something. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=502.72s)]
*  So whenever he stayed over, my mom would make more of these jingle bells on his wrists. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=505.72s)]
*  Ironically, the more they jingle, the little iron probably peeled off, went into his bloodstream. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=510.72s)]
*  His hand full of iron puts it on his open cock and it gets into his bloodstream. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=517.72s)]
*  It's a win win. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=522.72s)]
*  Yeah, I think she just wanted to keep things, you know, if he started cleaning himself out, [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=523.72s)]
*  she wanted to keep things cultured. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=527.72s)]
*  It's a good safety mechanism, too. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=530.72s)]
*  But I'm just saying the silver lining, he might be up, you know, he might have more [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=532.72s)]
*  energy throughout the day because his iron levels are regulated. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=535.72s)]
*  Well, I think he was missing some silver lining. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=538.72s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=540.72s)]
*  Which is the problem at the beginning. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=541.72s)]
*  But yeah, he was a copper heavy dude. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=544.72s)]
*  You can see some of those dudes. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=546.72s)]
*  We had a guy in our neighborhood, he fucking had an extra copper in his blood or whatever. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=548.72s)]
*  And he would have to, he had real heavy eyelids. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=553.72s)]
*  So when they'd blink down, his whole head would kind of go down like that. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=556.72s)]
*  Like it just, you know, and then he had a C1 cervical issue. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=559.72s)]
*  He had, I think, some kind of spinal issue because of the... [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=565.72s)]
*  Sure, the constant heavy blinking. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=568.72s)]
*  That copper, baby. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=571.72s)]
*  That's going to take a toll on the neck. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=572.72s)]
*  Either it's going to get stronger or you're fucked. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=574.72s)]
*  And he just didn't have it in him. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=576.72s)]
*  He didn't have that thick neck. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=578.72s)]
*  Yeah, he didn't have that torque in him. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=579.72s)]
*  But yeah, congratulations, Alex, too. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=581.72s)]
*  Alex just, and he knocked up the lady. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=583.72s)]
*  Wow. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=585.72s)]
*  We got a half on deck. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=586.72s)]
*  Alert the fucking maternity ward. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=590.72s)]
*  He got a fucking baby with some slippery fingers. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=596.72s)]
*  He's going to take the other baby's pacifiers out of the fucking... [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=600.72s)]
*  Hey, hide the fentanyl patches. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=604.72s)]
*  We got an Albanian. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=608.72s)]
*  Dude, that would be the best cartoon. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=613.72s)]
*  If you ever did a cartoon, it would just be Albanian babies. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=614.72s)]
*  Absolutely, Albanian babies. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=617.72s)]
*  Yeah, what do you say, guys? [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=619.72s)]
*  Well, in the Bronx, they're like, that's the Mafia. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=621.72s)]
*  Albanian babies? [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=624.72s)]
*  Well, yeah, babies. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=625.72s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=626.72s)]
*  I'm sure there's some tough Albanian babies. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=627.72s)]
*  Yeah, Albanians. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=629.72s)]
*  There's something about that Russian, like, you know, you'll get your child like a doll made out of stone. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=630.72s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=637.72s)]
*  Your child like a 30 pound doll. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=639.72s)]
*  Yes, absolutely. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=641.72s)]
*  A real life Gollum. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=642.72s)]
*  You get them a real Jewish folklore. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=644.72s)]
*  They're like, look, we're going to have to train against these because they tend to also be anti-Semitic. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=646.72s)]
*  And they think Gollums are real. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=651.72s)]
*  So they get their baby. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=652.72s)]
*  Albanians? [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=653.72s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=654.72s)]
*  Are they really anti-Semitic? [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=655.72s)]
*  Well, I think a lot of the Eastern world is. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=656.72s)]
*  Really? [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=659.72s)]
*  Well, because you've got to look at Europe. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=660.72s)]
*  They figure ways to be racist. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=661.72s)]
*  Like, Yugoslavia broke up because Serbia thinks they're different from fucking Croatia or whatever. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=663.72s)]
*  Right. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=669.72s)]
*  Right? [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=670.72s)]
*  To like, you wouldn't know the fucking difference, right? [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=671.72s)]
*  I barely would. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=672.72s)]
*  So is it or is it that they also respect their individuality more? [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=673.72s)]
*  I'm not, is that part of it, too, that like, because are they anti-everything? [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=677.72s)]
*  Are they anti-like? [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=681.72s)]
*  Yes, they definitely think they're the man. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=682.72s)]
*  Right. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=684.72s)]
*  Every, like, they think like each little fucking village. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=685.72s)]
*  It goes back to like village shit. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=688.72s)]
*  So it's like, but that but it's so funny to be like, you'll see people who will kill, you know, grandmothers over this conflict. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=690.72s)]
*  And then you like zoom out and it's like same fucking guy. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=697.72s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=700.72s)]
*  Like, there's nothing different. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=701.72s)]
*  It's like the tracksuits are slightly different colors. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=702.72s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=704.72s)]
*  But they're the same type of, you know, same dude. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=705.72s)]
*  But it is funny to have like there's everyone has pride in that part of the world. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=709.72s)]
*  Everybody has pride. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=712.72s)]
*  Then it's like you can drive through the country like you drive through Greece in eight hours. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=713.72s)]
*  It's not a big fucking country. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=717.72s)]
*  But like, yeah, dude, it's crazy when you go through a trip to Europe and you're like the French and the English just for thousands of years fought each other. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=719.72s)]
*  And they're fucking, you know, a 20 minute helicopter ride apart. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=727.72s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=731.72s)]
*  Like it's like getting to Queens from Queens to JFK. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=732.72s)]
*  It's like that's part of France is that close to England. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=736.72s)]
*  It's fucked up. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=739.72s)]
*  That's why. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=740.72s)]
*  Yeah, it is crazy to think I wish I sometimes I wish we still I wish we had more stuff like that. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=741.72s)]
*  I wish we would sometimes go to state governments. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=745.72s)]
*  Do you think we would that we could end up like that over here? [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=746.72s)]
*  Get go more individual state statewide like, you know, the original sort of conception where everybody has their own little their own little vibe. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=749.72s)]
*  Yeah, I think it would just be I mean, it would make sports would be so much more exciting because you would be like, yeah, if Georgia is playing California, [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=757.72s)]
*  yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=766.72s)]
*  Well, that's that is what's cool about like I love soccer, obviously. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=767.72s)]
*  And that's the one thing American sports misses is that like these are countries that literally fought each other. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=770.72s)]
*  Yeah. When you have fucking Algeria playing France, those motherfuckers colonized Algeria like Algeria wants to fuck them up. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=775.72s)]
*  So it is cool. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=782.72s)]
*  But yes, I think you're right. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=783.72s)]
*  It would be a real it would be a real melee situation. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=784.72s)]
*  I think about that sometimes where it's like, yeah, what does happen if we just, you know, everyone everyone calls each other's bluff. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=788.72s)]
*  And we're just like, fuck you. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=794.72s)]
*  Fuck you. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=795.72s)]
*  We're separate countries. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=796.72s)]
*  And then we see what happens. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=797.72s)]
*  I think it would be really exciting. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=798.72s)]
*  And I think it would definitely be more exciting. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=800.72s)]
*  And also, the states are getting really different. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=802.72s)]
*  You're having states that are like going bankrupt. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=804.72s)]
*  You're having states that are keeping it together. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=806.72s)]
*  You have in states that are like, you know, that can't take care of their people. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=808.72s)]
*  We have in states that that can take care of their people. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=813.72s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=816.72s)]
*  Totally. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=817.72s)]
*  You have states that have like legal gun carrying states that, you know, it's like, I think you're getting. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=818.72s)]
*  They seem to be getting more separate than together. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=823.72s)]
*  And I think we as a country seem to be getting like that at times. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=826.72s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, it's also fucking huge. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=829.72s)]
*  You do think about it. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=831.72s)]
*  You're like, this really shouldn't be one country. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=832.72s)]
*  We really should break it up. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=835.72s)]
*  I would love to have a couple countries. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=837.72s)]
*  Yeah, give a couple countries, you know, still no pass. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=839.72s)]
*  Still like like the EU. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=842.72s)]
*  I can go vacation there. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=844.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=845.72s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=846.72s)]
*  I don't want to have to do a bunch more paperwork to get in. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=847.72s)]
*  But, you know, that's the other thing. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=849.72s)]
*  You know, the culture warship would get so annoying where it would be like if you're from New York and you just want to come hang out in the south, you know they would fucking they would fuck with you a little more and vice versa. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=850.72s)]
*  Yeah. You know what I mean? [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=859.72s)]
*  They would be like Yankees. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=860.72s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=861.72s)]
*  Yeah. Absolutely. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=862.72s)]
*  You'd have to wear like a gay patch. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=863.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=865.72s)]
*  If you were gay, you mean? [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=866.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=867.72s)]
*  Oh, to let like a Star of David thing or whatever. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=868.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=870.72s)]
*  There'd be certain places where it's like, if you're trans, we want to know. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=871.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=874.72s)]
*  Put a patch on. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=875.72s)]
*  Put the trans patch on. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=876.72s)]
*  Nobody's got a problem. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=877.72s)]
*  We just want to know what we're dealing with. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=878.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=879.72s)]
*  Florida. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=880.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=881.72s)]
*  Look, it's it's hunting season just started and some of these guys can't see well. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=882.72s)]
*  So we will. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=887.72s)]
*  I've is. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=888.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=889.72s)]
*  We will. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=890.72s)]
*  This patch on. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=891.72s)]
*  Look, if you have a if you're sexually uncertain, we need you to put this on. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=892.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=895.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=896.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=897.72s)]
*  Because we want to know if we fuck you, if it's gay or not. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=898.72s)]
*  That's it. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=901.72s)]
*  Nothing to do with you. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=902.72s)]
*  It's all about our accounting. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=903.72s)]
*  We keep track of our own. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=905.72s)]
*  You're on vacation. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=907.72s)]
*  We're not going to fuck with you. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=908.72s)]
*  But if you get sucked off by our pal, he gets one gay strike. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=909.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=913.72s)]
*  Three strikes and you're out. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=914.72s)]
*  Three strikes. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=916.72s)]
*  They take a little bit of your penis away. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=917.72s)]
*  Unless you get elected as to be a senator, you get two more strikes. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=920.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=924.72s)]
*  That would be. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=925.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=926.72s)]
*  That's interesting. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=927.72s)]
*  Make. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=928.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=929.72s)]
*  Making state government even gayer, which is hard to do. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=930.72s)]
*  I just put I think I would. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=932.72s)]
*  It would be neat. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=934.72s)]
*  I think if you were to have to take more, like excitement about your state, I think, [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=935.72s)]
*  or you would have to take more state responsibility. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=939.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=942.72s)]
*  I think what would be some of the good points of that, I wonder? [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=943.72s)]
*  Well, I think a lot of it would be you would get to decide how to spend the money. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=947.72s)]
*  I worry that I think it's a good idea in theory. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=951.72s)]
*  And again, I don't fucking know because that's been so long since I've actually known shit like this. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=954.72s)]
*  But I think a lot of states depend on federal funding way more than we realize. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=958.72s)]
*  Just say Mississippi. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=963.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=964.72s)]
*  Right. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=965.72s)]
*  Right. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=966.72s)]
*  Right. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=967.72s)]
*  Right. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=968.72s)]
*  I think what would happen is like and also it's like once you stop being different, once [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=969.72s)]
*  you stop being like you could in theory be like, well, we're not going to spend money [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=974.72s)]
*  on the military. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=977.72s)]
*  Like there could be like, you know, liberal states are like, we're putting our money into [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=978.72s)]
*  whatever the fuck. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=982.72s)]
*  And then it's like, first of all, who gets all who gets all the all the fucking planes? [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=983.72s)]
*  That's when we play like rock, paper, scissors for that shit. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=987.72s)]
*  Well, the military would still have to be a general consensus unless you'd have state [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=990.72s)]
*  military as well. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=994.72s)]
*  Right. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=995.72s)]
*  But you would you what you're talking about essentially is becoming independent countries. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=996.72s)]
*  That's true. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=1000.72s)]
*  Or coalitions. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=1001.72s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=1002.72s)]
*  Like if you broke it up into four states, maybe divided up by population. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=1003.72s)]
*  Yeah, maybe it would be. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=1008.72s)]
*  Yeah, it would definitely be exciting, bro, to have that go on in our lifetime. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=1010.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=1013.72s)]
*  Well, we started out of the country. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=1014.72s)]
*  We couldn't do it. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=1015.72s)]
*  Couldn't do it. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=1016.72s)]
*  And so we started to separate. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=1017.72s)]
*  Why wouldn't you fuck up the like the liberal country, the liberal country, though? [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=1019.72s)]
*  Like it just feels like it would be a quick like the all the place with guns. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=1024.72s)]
*  If I were a gun guy. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=1028.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=1030.72s)]
*  And you gave if you took, you know, New York and all these huge economies, it's like, why [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=1031.72s)]
*  don't we just go fucking kill those guys? [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=1035.72s)]
*  Why would you just declare war and be like dibs on, you know, this shit? [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=1037.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=1042.72s)]
*  Oh, I think it definitely at New Year's Eve when it was like the time where you shoot [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=1043.72s)]
*  guns in the air. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=1047.72s)]
*  I have a feeling everybody would just turn their guns right over to the state they don't [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=1048.72s)]
*  love. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=1052.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=1053.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=1054.72s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=1055.72s)]
*  So the bullets all flew over. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=1056.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=1057.72s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=1058.72s)]
*  Well, who knows? [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=1059.72s)]
*  Who knows where it comes down? [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=1060.72s)]
*  Not my problem. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=1061.72s)]
*  I'm celebrating. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=1062.72s)]
*  Like it's 19. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=1063.72s)]
*  You're just unloading the clip. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=1064.72s)]
*  Or an Albanian wedding, maybe. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=1065.72s)]

*  Oh, you say we probably get down to maybe 20 states or something. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=1104.72s)]

*  Yeah. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=1172.72s)]
*  That is interesting because my my gut reaction would be well, whoever has guns, you know, [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=1173.72s)]
*  southern states, whatever, we're fucked up. [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=1177.72s)]
*  But every every time I feel like you look at Fox News, it's like a different guy that's [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=1179.72s)]
*  so scared to go to New York City, who's like the toughest guy. [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=1182.72s)]
*  It's like you have guns and shit, but you're scared of the homeless. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=1186.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=1188.72s)]
*  So it's kind of a natural it would it would be a natural like stalemate. [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=1189.72s)]
*  It's like we just need a wall of patrolling and then give them houses, give them little [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=1193.72s)]
*  sick homeless huts. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=1198.72s)]
*  Lean to's on the outside. [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=1200.72s)]

*  Get a shantytown. [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=1202.72s)]
*  Teach farming to homeless people. [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=1203.72s)]
*  I wonder if well, I think one of the big issues with the homeless is just that it's there's [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=1204.72s)]
*  two there's like half people are not doing well. [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=1209.72s)]
*  Half the people are drug users. [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=1213.72s)]
*  There's huge beef on the street between homeless and just drugs on this drugs sleeping outdoors, [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=1215.72s)]
*  doing drugs. [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=1222.72s)]

*  Yeah. [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=1225.72s)]
*  We don't know about that. [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=1226.72s)]
*  Get out of our community kind of thing. [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=1227.72s)]
*  Right. [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=1228.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=1229.72s)]
*  There's a lot of beef out there between those two cultures. [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=1230.72s)]
*  I get that. [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=1231.72s)]
*  I get that. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=1232.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=1233.72s)]
*  Dude, they had talked about this before, I think, but they had in Los Angeles. [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=1234.72s)]
*  My apartment is right by a big park. [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=1236.72s)]
*  Right. [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=1238.72s)]
*  And it's a hell of homeless out there. [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=1239.72s)]
*  There's a dude that they caught killing. [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=1240.72s)]
*  He had a rooster and then they finally found the dude that had it right. [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=1243.72s)]
*  He was waking everybody up right for a four block radius. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=1246.72s)]
*  This fucking thing. [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=1249.72s)]
*  They finally know chickens. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=1250.72s)]
*  Just the rooster. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=1252.72s)]
*  We ended up killing the bird and doing a meal with it. [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=1253.72s)]
*  Oh, nice. [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=1257.72s)]
*  And then they had another pair of guys and one of them I think was a woman. [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=1258.72s)]
*  But whatever. [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=1262.72s)]
*  Sure. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=1263.72s)]
*  Sure. [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=1264.72s)]
*  Everybody can do what they want. [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=1265.72s)]
*  Yep. [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=1266.72s)]
*  And but yeah, they were two men. [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=1267.72s)]
*  And then they stole a bunch of high school band equipment, right? [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=1268.72s)]
*  So, bro, it was fucking crazy. [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=1273.72s)]
*  If you're going to do homeless crime, make it fun. [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=1280.72s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=1282.72s)]
*  With your dick hanging out of your old ass sweatpants. [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=1283.72s)]
*  They were just, bro, they hit his head sheet music from a high school. [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=1289.72s)]

*  Like, you know what I mean? [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=1308.72s)]
*  Like, let's learn how to play the fucking French horn, dude. [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=1309.72s)]

*  Yeah. [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=1314.72s)]
*  There's some guy playing taps every night when they go to bed. [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=1315.72s)]
*  I love that, dude. [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=1320.72s)]
*  That's fucking sick. [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=1322.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=1323.72s)]
*  Man, but, dude, congratulations. [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=1324.72s)]
*  There is something that or I don't know if you feel it because you're from a little bit younger generation than me, right? [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=1325.72s)]
*  You know, probably 10 years younger. [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=1330.72s)]
*  So do you feel like was there a level of getting Netflix that made you it made you feel a certain way? [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=1332.72s)]
*  Because for sure. [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=1338.72s)]
*  Was there? [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=1339.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=1340.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=1341.72s)]
*  I mean, I think I think part of it was like these last couple of years went better than I thought possible. [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=1342.72s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=1346.72s)]
*  Like I put out the special and I started posting clips of people just responding in a way that I'm still confused a little bit about where I'm like, or these like theaters and shit like that. [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=1348.72s)]
*  And part of me was like, this is fucking sick. [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=1357.72s)]
*  I'll always continue to do this. [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=1359.72s)]
*  I love having control over how like people interact with my shit. [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=1361.72s)]
*  But at the end of the day, there is something there's a huge, a totally different type of audience on Netflix, mainstream people that really want to do this. [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=1365.72s)]
*  Even though everything's moving online, that's like shit moves slower than people give it credit for. [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=1374.72s)]
*  Right. [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=1379.72s)]
*  So there's still so many people that like don't know who the fuck you are if you're just on YouTube, even though it might even though it really helps selling tickets. [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=1380.72s)]
*  So it was like I was just like I want one like I have no mainstream credits. [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=1386.72s)]
*  I have not one like, you know, no fucking late night. [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=1392.72s)]
*  No, you know, no TV, none of that shit. [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=1396.72s)]
*  So it's just like, let's get one real one and let's let it be a place where everybody fucking it still has that like like because there's no Comedy Central Hour anymore. [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=1399.72s)]
*  There's no HBO special anymore. [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=1408.72s)]
*  I mean, I know they exist. [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=1410.72s)]
*  Don't get me wrong. [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=1411.72s)]
*  But it's like Netflix for a while, I think, became the place for comedy. [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=1412.72s)]
*  And so and I think they kind of they realized that with everybody doing YouTube. [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=1416.72s)]
*  Like everybody who got specials recently, you know, you look at Shane, you know, I mean like Sam, Mark, whatever everybody. [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=1423.72s)]
*  Me, we all had to fucking go do it. [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=1431.72s)]
*  We had to almost prove it. [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=1433.72s)]
*  And then Netflix like oh, fuck, this this is going, we miss go. [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=1434.72s)]
*  Yeah, like, but then they're doing a good job of like they're like, no, do it here now. [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=1437.72s)]
*  And I think it's been a really good thing of for comedy where it's like we all made our own fan bases. [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=1441.72s)]
*  And now it's like, we've made our own fan bases. [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=1446.72s)]
*  made our own fan bases and now it's like, [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=1450.72s)]
*  now some of us are bringing fan bases there, [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=1453.16s)]
*  but then it's like, there's regular motherfuckers [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=1455.08s)]
*  that just wanna watch, you know, [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=1457.44s)]
*  I mean, The Office is on Peacock now, [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=1460.08s)]
*  but like, The Office, just some mainstream shit [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=1461.48s)]
*  that have no fucking clue who I am. [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=1464.0s)]
*  So it was, it does feel really cool, [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=1465.56s)]
*  and a lot of people, it's funny, [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=1468.3600000000001s)]
*  because people in your audience will be like, [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=1469.64s)]
*  dude, Netflix, hell yeah, that's huge, [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=1471.68s)]
*  and it's like, it is, but also like, you're here. [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=1473.8s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=1476.44s)]
*  Like, you found me already, why does it matter [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=1477.28s)]
*  that I got an F, but like, it does still matter, [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=1479.1599999999999s)]
*  and to me it feels cool, because it's like, you know, [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=1481.7199999999998s)]
*  it feels like the place where, theoretically, [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=1483.9799999999998s)]
*  it could be some huge, not that I'm banking on [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=1488.1599999999999s)]
*  to be some huge hit, but it's like, [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=1490.52s)]
*  you're at least in the mix, where it's like, [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=1491.9199999999998s)]
*  all the mainstream shit is on there, [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=1494.4399999999998s)]
*  so it's like, you feel like you're in a different, [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=1495.8799999999999s)]
*  you know, kind of in a little bit of a different, [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=1498.7399999999998s)]
*  like, league a little bit, so it's cool. [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=1500.6s)]
*  No, it's interesting, yeah, [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=1503.2399999999998s)]
*  because I think it used to feel like, [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=1504.12s)]
*  yeah, if you got a special on something, [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=1505.8s)]
*  or you got, it wasn't, you couldn't tell your friends [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=1508.0s)]
*  you were a comedian, it felt like, [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=1510.56s)]
*  this is just my perception, [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=1513.1599999999999s)]
*  that until you got something on television, [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=1514.48s)]
*  or something, something on streaming something somewhere, [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=1516.76s)]
*  until then, a lot of people thought you were just like, [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=1520.1999999999998s)]
*  a gay guy, like, trying not to be gay. [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=1521.84s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=1523.84s)]
*  You know, like, damn, like, dude, this guy, yeah. [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=1524.6799999999998s)]
*  This is how he gets out of his system, you know? [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=1527.4399999999998s)]
*  He can't sing, he can't dance, [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=1529.4399999999998s)]
*  all these guys telling little stories, [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=1531.12s)]
*  he tried playing the homeless trombone, [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=1533.4399999999998s)]
*  he got blown off the fucking streets, [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=1535.6s)]
*  so now he's gotta do his gay little stories. [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=1538.44s)]
*  Yeah, that was it. [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=1541.32s)]
*  It really is art for the least talented people [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=1542.6799999999998s)]
*  in the world, that's what we're doing, [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=1544.8s)]
*  it's like, we have no, we are not showmen, [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=1546.36s)]
*  you put us in the 20s when everyone, [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=1549.12s)]
*  how you doing, my lady, you know, in between, [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=1551.32s)]
*  they had to be their own dance guys, we're fucked. [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=1553.8799999999999s)]
*  We just gotta tell humorous stories. [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=1556.44s)]
*  Yeah, we would be on a warning poster. [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=1560.3999999999999s)]
*  Oh my God, yeah. [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=1562.6399999999999s)]
*  Dude, we were peeping times before they had windows. [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=1563.48s)]
*  Yes, absolutely, just trying to put your cheek [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=1566.44s)]
*  up against a woman's window and maybe [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=1569.8s)]
*  she rubbed her tits on it for a second, [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=1571.8s)]
*  some of that heat gets through that window. [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=1573.88s)]
*  God, I miss all that and I love that. [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=1576.1200000000001s)]
*  You know, yeah, but there was something [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=1580.08s)]
*  about getting it in a place, and I think having it [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=1583.72s)]
*  in a place where it's like, I think it starts to, [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=1585.6s)]
*  if there's any, I was just wondering, [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=1587.76s)]
*  there used to be this thing in our heads [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=1589.24s)]
*  that would be like, oh man, this thing's spinning [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=1590.6s)]
*  and if I don't get, once you get something [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=1592.9199999999998s)]
*  in a place where people can go view it, [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=1595.1599999999999s)]
*  then it feels like you've achieved some goal. [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=1597.04s)]
*  Totally. [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=1600.6399999999999s)]
*  I don't know if it's a success, but it's a goal. [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=1601.48s)]
*  I really feel that way a little bit, where it's like, [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=1603.8s)]
*  That's what I was wondering, is it still like that? [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=1605.8799999999999s)]
*  It feels like a fucking save point in a video game. [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=1607.6399999999999s)]
*  Right. You know what I mean? [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=1610.8s)]
*  Oh yeah, we can save it now. [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=1611.6399999999999s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, it's like, I can take a break. [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=1612.68s)]
*  Because dude, I've been fucking, I've been going, [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=1614.84s)]
*  like I've been, since the pandemic ended, [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=1617.1599999999999s)]
*  it's like, it literally has just been like, [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=1619.6399999999999s)]
*  my road business and my, like shit all mine has kept growing [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=1623.52s)]
*  to a point where I felt like I couldn't stop. [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=1625.96s)]
*  I was like, I needed some tangible thing, [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=1628.28s)]
*  even though that's a little in your head, [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=1630.96s)]
*  I think we're both, and a lot of people [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=1632.88s)]
*  are just a little neurotic in comedy, [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=1634.92s)]
*  where you have to feel like you have earned a break. [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=1636.88s)]
*  And to me, it does, this thing does feel that way, [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=1639.8400000000001s)]
*  where it's like, I worked hard as fuck, [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=1642.2s)]
*  put out a special, busted my ass to get more material [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=1644.4s)]
*  in a year so that I could potentially do this. [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=1647.8s)]
*  And now it's like, we saved, I'm gonna go fuck, [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=1650.48s)]
*  I'm gonna do some side quests. [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=1653.48s)]
*  I'm in Vice City, I'm gonna go, I'm gonna go to the, [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=1655.3600000000001s)]
*  do the cheat, the hack where they suck you off. [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=1658.52s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. You know what I mean? [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=1661.0s)]
*  I'm gonna go to the beach and shoot, [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=1662.2s)]
*  you know what I mean, just like hang out. [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=1664.76s)]
*  Like I can't wait to do that. [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=1666.48s)]
*  But yeah, it definitely feels that way. [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=1667.88s)]
*  And it's hard, because not a lot, [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=1669.56s)]
*  there's not a lot of that stuff anymore. [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=1671.0s)]
*  A little bit of it feels like we don't know a path. [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=1672.92s)]
*  There are no answers. Wow. [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=1676.3200000000002s)]
*  The thing that's, except maybe your own podcast, [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=1677.64s)]
*  which is kind of why I started one too, [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=1680.48s)]
*  where it was just like, that's like you're connected [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=1681.76s)]
*  to your people once a week, and I love that aspect of it, [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=1683.92s)]
*  but everything else, dude, YouTube could fucking decide [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=1687.3200000000002s)]
*  we don't want dirty shit on our platform tomorrow. [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=1691.8400000000001s)]
*  And then what the fuck do you do? [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=1694.48s)]
*  You're fucked, you know? [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=1695.5600000000002s)]
*  And it's like, even Instagram, take that, [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=1696.8400000000001s)]
*  all those motherfuckers can change their algorithm like that. [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=1700.1200000000001s)]
*  They could ban you, just, I got plenty of shit, [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=1702.5600000000002s)]
*  you know what I mean? [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=1705.2800000000002s)]
*  Plenty of people, all convenience have said [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=1706.48s)]
*  some wild, banable shit if they decide to switch up. [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=1707.8400000000001s)]

*  That's awesome. [[01:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=3950.4399999999996s)]
*  But it's just that's weird, man. [[01:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=3951.6s)]
*  Where it's getting now is that absolutely that's how we're going to raise money [[01:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=3952.8399999999997s)]
*  for the for the for their county or whatever. [[01:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=3957.24s)]
*  Yeah, because they're like, yeah, you know, they're going to do a fight [[01:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=3960.04s)]
*  versus an only fans model. [[01:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=3962.7599999999998s)]
*  And that's where the funding is. [[01:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=3964.72s)]
*  It's like, yeah, the government is dead, man. [[01:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=3966.3199999999997s)]
*  It's like it's I know it just feels like it's the tech is the government now. [[01:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=3968.8399999999997s)]
*  Yeah, it's everything is so privatized, which is an issue. [[01:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=3976.2s)]
*  I mean, like, I'm not I don't think government is good, [[01:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=3979.04s)]
*  but I just think you can't trust business. [[01:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=3981.9599999999996s)]
*  I think it's like, like, I don't I don't trust the government, [[01:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=3984.24s)]
*  but I trust them. [[01:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=3987.72s)]
*  So we have slightly more direct control over the government than we do. [[01:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=3988.8799999999997s)]
*  Just rich people that can do whatever the fuck they want. [[01:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=3992.88s)]
*  Right. And that's what's scary is like tech, like you're saying, [[01:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=3995.2s)]
*  by default, kind of controls our lives. [[01:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=3998.36s)]
*  And it's like, you know, it starts out fine. [[01:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=4001.04s)]
*  But like we're just talking about, it's like we've made our living, [[01:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=4003.36s)]
*  honestly, a big part on with tech companies. [[01:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=4006.12s)]
*  YouTube's fucking Google. [[01:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=4008.88s)]
*  They're one of the biggest fucking tech companies in the world. [[01:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=4010.16s)]
*  Instagram, Metta, whatever you want to say. [[01:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=4012.32s)]
*  And now everything's fine. [[01:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=4014.64s)]
*  But it's like these motherfuckers can decide tomorrow [[01:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=4015.7599999999998s)]
*  that they can just want to. Yeah. [[01:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=4018.68s)]
*  You know what I mean? This guy's voice, we don't need it. [[01:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=4020.0s)]
*  It's not part of a bigger. [[01:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=4021.68s)]
*  If there's a say, like if those companies get together, [[01:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=4022.64s)]
*  what are what's our goals for the next five years? [[01:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=4024.8399999999997s)]
*  Yeah. OK, we got to weed some of these people out. [[01:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=4027.08s)]
*  Yeah. You know, it's like. [[01:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=4028.96s)]
*  But you're right in that, like, but it's true. [[01:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=4030.52s)]
*  And it's scary in that, like, yeah, there's no people [[01:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=4032.56s)]
*  didn't ever respect the government. [[01:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=4036.12s)]
*  I mean, or, you know, they did. [[01:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=4037.8799999999997s)]
*  There was a position of power or whatever. [[01:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=4039.3199999999997s)]
*  But it's like that's what happens when you don't get money, [[01:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=4041.0s)]
*  when it's so clear that these motherfuckers are bought and paid for, [[01:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=4044.08s)]
*  that you don't respect them anymore. [[01:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=4047.96s)]
*  And so then it becomes not who do I trust to like take care of my district, [[01:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=4049.72s)]
*  but who's cool? [[01:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=4054.8799999999997s)]
*  And it becomes a fucking weird popularity contest. [[01:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=4056.6s)]
*  And you get a guy who will probably be like, I'm not a pussy. [[01:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=4059.3199999999997s)]
*  I challenge some fucking dork to a fight. [[01:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=4063.16s)]
*  And then some fucking morons will be like, that's my fucking guy. [[01:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=4065.68s)]
*  Or like, what's your face jacking off that guy at Beetlejuice? [[01:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=4069.56s)]
*  Like, that was the coolest thing she's ever done. [[01:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=4072.72s)]
*  Oh, I didn't see that. Lauren Boebert, she jacked she over the pants, [[01:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=4074.7999999999997s)]

*  I don't agree with her politics, but I do agree with her stance as a date. [[01:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=4080.32s)]
*  Yeah, that's her date etiquette is awesome. [[01:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=4083.92s)]
*  Yeah, especially in a movie theater. [[01:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=4086.6000000000004s)]
*  And it was a packed movie theater. [[01:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=4087.88s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. I remember seeing that. [[01:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=4089.1600000000003s)]
*  I was like, wow, there's other people right there. [[01:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=4090.7200000000003s)]

*  Yeah, the guy's fucking entertaining. [[01:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=4096.52s)]
*  Well, and at this point, that's what I think some people are saying. [[01:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=4098.24s)]
*  This government is it's it's I think we've entered kind of like a privatized [[01:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=4100.56s)]
*  communism. That's what it feels like. Right. [[01:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=4104.320000000001s)]
*  And I don't know if communism's right where, but it's like a privatized [[01:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=4106.24s)]
*  like our leaders like tech is the new fossil fuel. [[01:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=4110.92s)]
*  I used to say that years ago. [[01:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=4113.5199999999995s)]
*  It's like that's the leaders now. [[01:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=4114.679999999999s)]
*  It's like whoever like, yeah, we can be shut down in a heartbeat [[01:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=4116.639999999999s)]
*  because somebody doesn't like our voice or somebody doesn't like what we say [[01:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=4120.28s)]
*  or our direction or whatever it is. [[01:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=4123.32s)]
*  And so those are the leaders. [[01:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=4125.5599999999995s)]
*  Those are the masters. [[01:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=4127.88s)]
*  And you kind of need a government. [[01:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=4128.88s)]
*  But it's like now the government is just being used as this shell company [[01:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=4130.32s)]
*  to kind of like that everybody's masquerading behind. [[01:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=4134.28s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, and also to funnel our funds into whatever they want. [[01:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=4137.24s)]
*  Totally. I mean, yeah, it's like I wouldn't say communism. [[01:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=4140.4s)]
*  I would say like it's kind of like a fucking oligarchy, which is like the little [[01:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=4143.16s)]
*  the few control everything. [[01:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=4146.8s)]
*  OK, that's better. [[01:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=4148.36s)]

*  And that's something we can work on long term to get rid of. [[01:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=4198.2s)]
*  But like now it's like they are sucking people dry completely. [[01:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=4200.5599999999995s)]

*  Oh, man, that is I got to admit, that's pretty good. [[01:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=4311.08s)]

*  That's a good point. [[01:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=4330.4s)]
*  Blind people deserve to laugh more than anyone. [[01:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=4331.2s)]
*  That's a that's a very good point. [[01:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=4332.56s)]
*  And if if putting a couple and bumps [[01:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=4334.88s)]

*  Maxx, that's our health care. [[01:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=4343.280000000001s)]
*  That's the closest we're getting to health care. [[01:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=4345.72s)]
*  Yeah, I know, dude. [[01:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=4348.04s)]
*  It's tough not to be like [[01:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=4348.8s)]
*  like almost like nihilistic where this shit's just not going to get better. [[01:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=4351.52s)]
*  Where you're like, it just feels like they're going to they're going to suck. [[01:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=4354.6s)]
*  People drive so much. [[01:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=4359.240000000001s)]
*  And I just don't see any representation of like [[01:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=4360.400000000001s)]
*  what a lot of I mean, it would have to be like a youth movement, I think. [[01:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=4364.320000000001s)]
*  But right of of like young people just having enough of this shit. [[01:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=4367.76s)]
*  And like because old people are just going to stay conservative. [[01:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=4371.68s)]
*  That's how it goes traditionally. [[01:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=4375.12s)]
*  And I just think like, I don't know, man, you just got to shit has to get shaken up. [[01:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=4377.4800000000005s)]
*  And we just need just basic shit. [[01:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=4381.72s)]
*  I mean, you saw obviously I was a big Bernie guy and there was a big outpouring of like [[01:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=4384.52s)]
*  like Trump and Bernie. [[01:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=4389.12s)]
*  It's not it's not a coincidence that two kind of outside [[01:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=4390.88s)]
*  different things really registered with people. [[01:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=4394.6s)]
*  I would say it ran together. [[01:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=4396.96s)]
*  Yeah, I really do. [[01:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=4398.4800000000005s)]
*  Because I think then you have. [[01:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=4400.04s)]
*  Yeah. Where the two or if one of them gets vice, one of them gets president, [[01:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=4401.68s)]
*  they have to compete. [[01:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=4404.8s)]
*  They have to work to really work together. [[01:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=4406.16s)]
*  Yeah. Instead of just working with some guy you picked. [[01:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=4408.08s)]
*  Yeah. You have to work with the other side. [[01:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=4410.12s)]
*  Yeah, I know what you mean. [[01:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=4412.4800000000005s)]
*  But there's no way like those guys were so apart on so much shit. [[01:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=4413.400000000001s)]
*  But I know what you mean. [[01:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=4417.2s)]
*  But as a as a person, yeah, an American of it in like, oh, that this is what I need. [[01:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=4418.16s)]
*  There I think that actually would have resonated with people just because it's like, [[01:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=4423.12s)]
*  you know, they were saying some sim. [[01:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=4427.96s)]
*  I mean, obviously, their solutions were very different. [[01:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=4430.08s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. But like and but like they were saying similar stuff about like [[01:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=4432.08s)]
*  this shit is just not, you know, I don't know that Trump is talking about [[01:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=4435.64s)]
*  inequality, obviously, but like they just felt like outsiders in a way. [[01:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=4438.28s)]
*  Trump was saying more general stuff. [[01:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=4442.04s)]
*  Bernie's message was, I think, way more like, you know, economically focused [[01:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=4443.24s)]
*  and redistributive. But like, yeah, everyone just wanted something new [[01:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=4446.92s)]
*  at that time. And we didn't get it. [[01:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=4451.32s)]
*  And we've doubled down on like and then ultimately, I think Trump got into office [[01:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=4454.2s)]
*  and he was like a pretty run of the mill. [[01:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=4457.6s)]
*  He didn't really do anything crazy, you know, anything like he didn't really shake [[01:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=4460.56s)]
*  shit up too much. And then you get Biden, who's the most like. [[01:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=4463.4800000000005s)]
*  You know, it's been the same shit again over and over. [[01:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=4468.32s)]
*  Right. That's what everybody's realizing. [[01:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=4470.68s)]
*  I think it's kind of no matter where it goes. [[01:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=4472.08s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. And that's what thing it's like. [[01:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=4473.68s)]
*  I think that's where people are at. [[01:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=4476.320000000001s)]
*  It's like, is this salvageable or is America just this experiment [[01:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=4477.4800000000005s)]
*  of freedom that didn't pan out? [[01:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=4481.0s)]
*  Right. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. [[01:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=4483.64s)]
*  Are we realizing that this is how capitalism falls? [[01:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=4486.52s)]
*  Because a lot of it is really greed. [[01:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=4488.92s)]
*  I think there should be a cap on how much money you can make as a human. [[01:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=4490.200000000001s)]
*  Dude, I fully agree. [[01:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=4493.88s)]
*  I think like when you look at how many what like big projects happened [[01:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=4495.080000000001s)]
*  in America, like when we got out of the depression, all this stuff, [[01:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=4499.56s)]
*  it's like after a certain amount of money, you got taxed at 90 percent. [[01:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=4502.88s)]

*  if we don't let it get sucked away by just by by technology. [[01:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=4988.92s)]

*  They're like they're like, I mean, they're like, look, this is just how society is. [[01:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=5005.76s)]
*  Constantly, technology is fucking at least in our lifetime. Right. [[01:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=5011.04s)]
*  Like since the Industrial Revolution, it's like every fucking 30 years. [[01:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=5014.200000000001s)]
*  Shit gets crazy. Right. [[01:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=5018.04s)]
*  Like and I don't think it's natural, obviously, but it's like a lot of the shit [[01:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=5019.320000000001s)]
*  we do is not natural. Right. [[01:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=5023.92s)]
*  We're fucking podcasting right now. You know what I mean? [[01:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=5025.16s)]
*  Like they didn't have this. [[01:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=5027.400000000001s)]
*  Man was not meant to podcast. You know what I mean? [[01:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=5028.84s)]
*  But and so on one hand, I'm like, well, look, technology is always going to expand. [[01:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=5031.56s)]
*  People are always going to like relate in different ways. [[01:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=5036.04s)]
*  But I do think that we are getting to a point where it's like [[01:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=5039.76s)]
*  this is getting so unnatural, where it's like I think we [[01:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=5044.0s)]
*  and the only solution, though, is to take a really to take a really active [[01:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=5047.4s)]
*  like step and say I'm off my phone this amount of time or regulate your phone use [[01:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=5053.36s)]
*  or like because people agree with with us, I think. [[01:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=5058.4s)]
*  But then they're like they're not going to stop looking at it. [[01:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=5060.88s)]
*  How can we do it? You know what I mean? [[01:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=5062.8s)]
*  It's like you it's almost like we are. [[01:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=5064.0s)]
*  It's like waking up and realizing, fuck, I got to go to rehab. [[01:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=5066.639999999999s)]
*  But it's like the entire world is fucking needs to go to rehab. [[01:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=5069.92s)]
*  Exactly. It's like it's like runs on these systems. [[01:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=5073.32s)]
*  And it doesn't it doesn't feel like it's going to go away at any point. [[01:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=5076.08s)]
*  And I think the only it's almost like a privileged thing. [[01:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=5079.76s)]
*  Like, look, me and you could fucking go take a take a two months in a cabin [[01:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=5083.5599999999995s)]
*  and not be on our phones. We'd be OK. Yeah. [[01:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=5087.68s)]
*  We can fucking hire, you know, like I literally hire somebody to post [[01:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=5089.96s)]
*  on Instagram for me because I don't want to be on it. [[01:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=5093.48s)]
*  Right. Yeah. Because like I would fucking go crazy if I was. [[01:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=5094.96s)]
*  But like a lot of people don't just like we've backed people into corner [[01:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=5097.5599999999995s)]
*  where it's like so much of life happens online choice. [[01:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=5101.76s)]
*  And it's like, what the fuck are they really going to do? [[01:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=5104.2s)]
*  You know what I mean? I wish it would be, you know, one of my favorite times [[01:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=5106.0s)]
*  as a child, like our family wasn't real close. [[01:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=5108.76s)]
*  And one of my favorite times was like some of the power would go out. [[01:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=5111.08s)]
*  Yeah. They get the candles out. [[01:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=5114.4s)]
*  Monopoly candles out and we'd all get together in the same room. [[01:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=5116.36s)]
*  Yeah. And we hated each other. [[01:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=5120.639999999999s)]
*  But for that four to 40 hours, right. [[01:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=5125.08s)]
*  Because we're in the poor area. [[01:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=5128.24s)]
*  You get power last. Yeah, absolutely. [[01:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=5130.04s)]
*  I mean, we would go to school still and have power. [[01:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=5132.24s)]
*  Other people had power. [[01:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=5134.2s)]
*  There were rich kids like showing up with pictures of power that they had. [[01:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=5136.16s)]
*  Going at their house. Yeah. [[01:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=5139.8s)]

*  It's something people have to do for themselves. [[01:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=5181.52s)]
*  It's something people have to just take an active role in their personal lives. [[01:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=5183.96s)]
*  And it's swimming upstream from society, which is like, use your phone, [[01:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=5188.5199999999995s)]

*  He could just be. Yeah. [[01:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=5432.0s)]
*  Yeah, he's definitely a shitty painter, but it's like, [[01:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=5433.5599999999995s)]

*  I think. Yeah. And he didn't even do his forehead. [[01:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=5443.44s)]
*  I think you could call him mixed. [[01:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=5446.12s)]
*  You know, you could say the guy works. [[01:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=5449.16s)]
*  It's not percentages. [[01:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=5451.4s)]
*  You could say the guy did the guys out here, Ben Simmons. [[01:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=5453.44s)]
*  Or naturally pretty Ben Simmons, though. Yeah. [[01:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=5457.88s)]
*  He's he's kind of he looks kind of Ben. [[01:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=5460.5199999999995s)]
*  He kind of looks like Ben's a young Benson. Yeah. [[01:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=5462.32s)]
*  Definitely. Look, so that I think is fair. [[01:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=5464.36s)]
*  You can't say this dude is fully blackface. [[01:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=5466.24s)]
*  I think at this point in society, you should be able to do half blackface. [[01:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=5468.88s)]
*  Half. Oh, you think you should do a nice mocha? [[01:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=5471.96s)]

*  I don't think you need to paint your skin his skin color to show that you're a fan. [[01:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=5480.12s)]
*  Maybe just his jersey would be fine. [[01:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=5483.879999999999s)]
*  Yeah, you could do just a jersey. [[01:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=5485.44s)]
*  But I think if you really want to freaking get in there. OK. [[01:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=5486.679999999999s)]
*  But getting the game, you know, somebody's motto for a while. [[01:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=5490.44s)]
*  Yeah. Getting the game to the game. [[01:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=5493.28s)]
*  OK. OK. This is interesting. [[01:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=5495.44s)]
*  If you want to do blackface, you have to prove that you are a hardcore [[01:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=5496.599999999999s)]
*  fan of the black person that you're doing the blackface of. OK. [[01:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=5500.879999999999s)]
*  You know, so that's fair. [[01:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=5504.0s)]
*  You know, you can't be doing it has to be a true has to be a true homage. [[01:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=5505.2s)]
*  Yeah, I want I want to quote you have to pass like a driving test, [[01:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=5510.0s)]
*  but it's like what college did Tiramathe go to? [[01:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=5512.72s)]

*  You know what I mean? Yeah. [[01:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=5517.6s)]
*  And if you ace that, then you get that you get to go to fucking [[01:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=5518.4s)]
*  you get to go to Sephora matches, [[01:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=5523.24s)]
*  get a foundation that matches his skin completely. [[01:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=5526.52s)]
*  And then you get it had that Sephora section. [[01:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=5530.12s)]
*  Sephora for the modern racist. [[01:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=5534.88s)]
*  They're not all black. [[01:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=5538.88s)]

*  integrity. It's funny, too, because I think some guys [[01:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=5549.2s)]
*  wouldn't care. Lips are that red. [[01:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=5553.28s)]
*  Get the real lip color. [[01:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=5555.84s)]
*  I think some guys wouldn't some people wouldn't care. [[01:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=5557.4s)]

*  being able to dress like their favorite if there's an athlete that's black. [[01:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=5563.0s)]
*  I think we're also probably two generations away from everybody being mixed. [[01:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=5566.84s)]
*  You know, yeah, I think so. I think we're getting there. [[01:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=5569.44s)]

*  Also, adoption. [[01:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=5587.88s)]
*  I feel like more people should adopt if only because [[01:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=5589.2s)]

*  Right, right, right. [[01:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=5964.16s)]
*  Nothing to do with archery. [[01:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=5965.28s)]
*  Not with Shaq arrows. [[01:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=5966.36s)]
*  Yeah. Shaq's arrows. [[01:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=5967.48s)]
*  Yeah. And then the next one was like, oh, is somebody shooting at your house? [[01:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=5968.84s)]
*  Get the insurance. [[01:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=5974.48s)]
*  It's perfect. [[01:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=5975.639999999999s)]
*  Yeah. You need the guardian or whatever it is. [[01:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=5976.48s)]
*  That little fucking insurance guy. [[01:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=5978.599999999999s)]
*  Oh, yes, the general. [[01:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=5979.76s)]
*  Yeah. Put Icy Hot on your grandmother. [[01:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=5980.8s)]
*  And get the general. [[01:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=5985.28s)]
*  But yeah, no, it's I respect athletes that are just like, this is my job. [[01:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=5987.599999999999s)]
*  It rules. I'm going to have the best time in the fucking world. [[01:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=5992.32s)]
*  And I'm not going to be Jordan. [[01:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=5996.12s)]
*  Dude, look at the fucking last dance. [[01:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=5998.36s)]
*  Jordan is sad. [[01:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=6000.88s)]
*  His eyes are fucking yellow, yellower than that 24 right there. [[01:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=6002.52s)]
*  You know what I mean? Like he's drunk as fuck. [[01:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=6006.12s)]
*  Like he put everything in those years. [[01:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=6008.64s)]
*  And yeah, he was the man. Right. [[01:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=6011.16s)]
*  And of course, Michael Jordan is the fucking man. [[01:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=6013.04s)]
*  I respect him. But it's like you'd rather be a guy [[01:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=6015.28s)]
*  who's a choke artist in the playoffs, but made millions of fucking dollars. [[01:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=6019.36s)]
*  And by the way, Harden had some good games against the Celtics last [[01:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=6023.16s)]
*  when he was on the Sixers last year. He had a couple bangers. [[01:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=6027.0s)]
*  But still, you'd rather just I would rather just be a guy who's awesome as shit [[01:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=6029.92s)]
*  and never wins, but has no stress versus a guy who's like lives and dies. [[01:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=6033.32s)]
*  You hear Larry Bird talk about championships. [[01:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=6039.04s)]
*  He's like, it doesn't feel it just doesn't feel disappointing when you win. [[01:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=6041.36s)]
*  And when you lose, you want to kill yours. [[01:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=6045.88s)]
*  It's like that crazy. [[01:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=6047.599999999999s)]
*  And like his and it's like, that's a fucking serial killer. [[01:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=6049.12s)]
*  And yeah, he's awesome. [[01:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=6051.48s)]
*  But I don't want that shit, dude. [[01:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=6052.64s)]
*  I want to have a good ass time. [[01:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=6054.28s)]
*  It's a great it's a great it's a great point, man. [[01:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=6055.72s)]
*  I think it's just an overall good point about how like we get caught up [[01:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=6057.48s)]
*  in having to be the champion. Yeah. [[01:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=6061.04s)]
*  And how unrealistic it is that everybody's going to be the champion. Totally. [[01:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=6063.04s)]
*  And to recognize, do I really want to do all it's going to do [[01:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=6067.16s)]
*  to possibly be the champion? [[01:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=6072.04s)]
*  And then what are you realistically left with? [[01:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=6074.36s)]
*  Like, yes, there's some recognition to it, [[01:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=6076.64s)]
*  but is that worth the things you might sacrifice along the way? [[01:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=6079.280000000001s)]
*  You know, yeah, totally. [[01:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=6083.08s)]
*  And yeah. And just because something's your job doesn't mean to be the champion [[01:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=6084.52s)]
*  when you show up, do a good job and have fun, have fun, entertain people. [[01:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=6087.84s)]
*  You know what I mean? Yeah. Awesome. [[01:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=6091.84s)]
*  That's great, man. I really appreciate you thinking about that. [[01:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=6094.320000000001s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. Of course, dude. [[01:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=6096.320000000001s)]
*  Yeah, it's just it's true. [[01:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=6098.160000000001s)]
*  It's like because you get on this invisible. [[01:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=6100.0s)]
*  It's almost like instead of walking, when you get to the airport, [[01:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=6101.84s)]
*  sometimes in Minneapolis, which, by the way, they've done a great job. [[01:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=6104.44s)]
*  Great airport. Great airport. [[01:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=6107.879999999999s)]
*  You get there and you can go on that track or you can just walk. [[01:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=6111.28s)]
*  And talk about with the floor. Yes, of course. [[01:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=6114.679999999999s)]
*  And it's like you just get on that moving floor and you just [[01:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=6116.919999999999s)]
*  you're not even really thinking about your steps. [[01:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=6118.96s)]
*  No, you're just, you know, but it does feel cool, I will say. [[01:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=6120.839999999999s)]
*  It is sorry to muddy up the analogy. [[01:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=6124.679999999999s)]
*  No, it's nice. But I feel fast as shit when I like you go on those [[01:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=6126.679999999999s)]
*  and I even pick up the pace and I'm like, I'm fucking Superman. [[01:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=6130.5199999999995s)]
*  I'm bionic. You'll go fast. You'll walk on. [[01:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=6133.88s)]
*  Oh, wow. I feel you feel so fast. [[01:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=6136.080000000001s)]
*  Yeah. Oh, you feel like you're in a threesome. [[01:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=6138.88s)]
*  No, that for me, historically, that's a nervous blowing it, [[01:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=6141.72s)]
*  you know, having the worst time in my life. [[01:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=6146.080000000001s)]
*  I've had I've had I've had a nice one, but most of them. [[01:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=6148.64s)]
*  Yeah. What city do you have a nice one in? [[01:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=6151.04s)]
*  Chicago. OK. And one in New York. [[01:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=6153.0s)]
*  But yeah, had some bad ones. [[01:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=6156.320000000001s)]
*  A couple other places. [[01:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=6158.68s)]
*  Oh, you've been in a multiple. [[01:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=6159.8s)]
*  In a couple. Yeah. [[01:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=6161.48s)]
*  My I ended my special with a did we talk about this last time? [[01:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=6162.36s)]
*  It feels like I remember because I feel like you were in one. [[01:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=6166.28s)]
*  I was in a unique one outside of Missouri. [[01:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=6169.64s)]
*  Yes, we talked about it. We talked about it. [[01:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=6171.56s)]
*  Great. Everybody made it out. OK. [[01:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=6173.16s)]
*  To be honest, you know, yes. [[01:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=6176.68s)]
*  Yeah. But if you're crushing it, if you're crushing it in threesome, [[01:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=6178.8s)]
*  that's probably what that feels like. [[01:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=6183.2s)]
*  Well, my thing was I didn't know one of the girls [[01:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=6184.72s)]
*  who I like was trying to small talk while I was looking up with this other girl. [[01:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=6186.24s)]
*  This was like, hey, where are you from? [[01:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=6189.32s)]
*  You know, no, you have family and you're just make it just. [[01:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=6192.5199999999995s)]
*  The whole thing was just ridiculous. [[01:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=6196.84s)]
*  What other news we got? Let's bring a little bit more up. [[01:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=6199.04s)]
*  I think you just got to turn. [[01:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=6201.759999999999s)]
*  I think you just got to turn that brain off, brother. [[01:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=6203.08s)]
*  When you're you're right. When the dick is hard, the brain is off. [[01:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=6205.28s)]
*  That's that's I think how it needs. [[01:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=6208.12s)]
*  Oh, my that has been my number one problem. [[01:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=6209.599999999999s)]
*  I remember when I used to be able to smoke weed sometimes, my erection, [[01:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=6211.5599999999995s)]
*  because my brain would shut off. Yes. [[01:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=6214.759999999999s)]
*  And my erection, dude, it would be like, oh, my God, [[01:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=6216.599999999999s)]
*  it would be like somebody that had gotten to the top of the hill [[01:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=6219.12s)]
*  for the first time in its life. [[01:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=6221.8s)]
*  Oh, my goodness. This view is unbelievable. [[01:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=6224.0s)]
*  It stayed up there. It was doing selfies. [[01:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=6226.5599999999995s)]
*  Yeah, dude, I'm with you, too. [[01:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=6230.24s)]
*  That is always my problem, because I when I actually like a girl, [[01:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=6231.5199999999995s)]
*  the first time I fuck her, I have been hard zero percent of the time [[01:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=6235.28s)]
*  because I'm worried I'm going to blow it. [[01:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=6238.96s)]
*  But then if I don't get if it's like, you know, just we both know the score. [[01:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=6240.599999999999s)]
*  We're just here to bust. [[01:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=6244.12s)]
*  No problems, dickwise. [[01:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=6245.88s)]
*  And then again, if I break through and I've been dating somebody for a while [[01:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=6247.2s)]
*  and I trust, you know, all that all the like anxiety of like, [[01:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=6251.599999999999s)]
*  does this person like me, all this shit, when that truly goes away, [[01:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=6255.28s)]
*  not just intellectually, but I feel it's going away. [[01:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=6259.16s)]
*  My dick actually truly gets hard. Really? [[01:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=6261.88s)]
*  And then we broke. [[01:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=6264.36s)]
*  And literally this happened to me where I dated somebody and we finally [[01:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=6265.28s)]
*  I felt like we finally got all our shit figured out. [[01:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=6268.639999999999s)]
*  And my dick was getting harder than ever to the point where she was like, [[01:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=6271.0s)]
*  what's up with your dick? [[01:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=6274.24s)]
*  Like she was literally like something's different. [[01:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=6275.2s)]
*  Your dick is like actually she was like, [[01:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=6276.92s)]
*  she was like mildly uncomfortable the first for the first time ever [[01:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=6281.2s)]
*  having sex with me. [[01:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=6284.52s)]
*  She's like, your dick has gotten not small anymore. [[01:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=6285.2s)]
*  That was essentially not big, not big, but not small, you know. [[01:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=6289.64s)]
*  Yeah. And then literally we broke up. [[01:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=6293.4400000000005s)]
*  It felt good. It felt good. [[01:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=6295.4800000000005s)]
*  Feeling positive. Yeah. Yeah. [[01:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=6296.76s)]
*  Man, that's it. I've never I never try and work through that uncomfortable phase [[01:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=6298.56s)]
*  to see if there's a real phase on the other side. [[01:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=6304.4400000000005s)]
*  It's so hard for me, man. [[01:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=6306.44s)]

*  The creation and continuation of Israel is one of the greatest crimes. [[01:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=6770.0s)]
*  And you are the leaders of its criminals, Bin Laden wrote. [[01:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=6773.0s)]
*  Each and every person whose hands have become polluted in the contribution [[01:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=6775.84s)]

*  Oh, here it says the Saudi born militant then wrote the Palestinians had to be [[01:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=6783.04s)]
*  revenged along with the people of Afghanistan. [[01:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=6786.4400000000005s)]
*  So what he's saying is, oh, and here it is. [[01:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=6788.8s)]
*  The American people are the ones who pay the taxes, [[01:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=6790.6s)]
*  which fund the planes that bomb us in Afghanistan, [[01:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=6792.76s)]
*  the tanks that strike and destroy our homes in Palestine, [[01:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=6795.52s)]
*  the armies which occupy our lands in the Arabian Gulf [[01:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=6798.320000000001s)]
*  and the fleets which ensure the blockade of Iraq. [[01:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=6801.120000000001s)]
*  This is why the American people cannot be innocent of all the crimes committed [[01:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=6804.160000000001s)]
*  by the Americans and Jews against us. [[01:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=6807.04s)]
*  We had we had to hit it. [[01:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=6809.08s)]
*  Hit us with a J. Didn't you, Osama? [[01:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=6810.8s)]
*  But so what is he saying here? [[01:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=6814.08s)]
*  He's saying he's basically saying that we have a we we can't. [[01:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=6815.4800000000005s)]
*  You can't just look at America's actions as no repercussions of them. [[01:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=6820.44s)]
*  I think so. I mean, look, obviously, I'm not Osama bin Laden's off here. [[01:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=6825.28s)]
*  Like, obviously, I'm not aligned with Osama, where he's basically like [[01:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=6829.88s)]
*  no, neither one of us are. [[01:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=6833.24s)]
*  He's basically like, yeah, I know. [[01:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=6834.599999999999s)]
*  I'm sorry. I don't mean to be like I don't mean to be like you. [[01:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=6835.759999999999s)]
*  No, no. But I think he's based. [[01:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=6838.2s)]
*  I think he's saying that, like, by just living in America, [[01:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=6840.88s)]
*  no one's innocent and you're able to fucking. [[01:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=6845.0s)]
*  That's why I think that's how they're talking about terrorism and stuff like that. [[01:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=6848.44s)]
*  And and but I do think what he's saying, obviously, he's wrong about that. [[01:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=6852.76s)]
*  You're right. Well, you shouldn't kill fucking innocent people at all. [[01:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=6856.72s)]
*  But I think he's saying that American imperialism is like, [[01:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=6859.84s)]
*  people are going to be fucking pissed off about that. [[01:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=6862.88s)]
*  Yes, America has supplied Israel with tons of money, billions of dollars. [[01:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=6864.84s)]
*  And the and they they're they need Israel. [[01:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=6869.96s)]
*  America needs Israel because it's a strategic, you know, base [[01:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=6873.24s)]
*  in the Middle East. [[01:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=6877.36s)]
*  It's the only it's the only like ally that they have there. [[01:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=6878.44s)]
*  You know, and so and they've they've just kind of turned [[01:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=6882.36s)]
*  we've all kind of turned a blind eye to the situation in Gaza, [[01:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=6886.4s)]
*  where it's like, yeah, they're there completely. [[01:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=6891.0s)]
*  They don't have an independent government. [[01:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=6895.32s)]
*  They're under the rule of Israel. [[01:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=6896.639999999999s)]
*  And each year it gets like a little they take more and more of their like, [[01:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=6898.36s)]
*  you know, the land. [[01:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=6902.12s)]
*  Yeah. And I guess the whole point is like, yeah, [[01:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=6903.96s)]
*  America has been acting in a lot of fucked up ways [[01:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=6907.72s)]
*  that fucking a lot of people are pissed off about. [[01:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=6910.36s)]
*  And I think a lot of people know about either, probably. [[01:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=6913.08s)]
*  Totally. Absolutely. You know, absolutely. [[01:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=6915.04s)]
*  Like you don't think sometimes that like if you go and do something in a country, [[01:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=6916.92s)]
*  if your forces, it's like you want to cheer your forces on because they're your team. [[01:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=6920.4400000000005s)]

*  But if if you kill people in Iraq [[01:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=6926.92s)]
*  because you're hunting al Qaeda, totally. [[01:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=6930.92s)]
*  And you kill a ton of civilians. [[01:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=6933.12s)]

*  It's a true empathy thing of like, think about if this is how you lived. [[01:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=6945.04s)]
*  If like if you were under if you're in Iraq, if you're in Afghanistan, post-war, [[01:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=6950.08s)]

*  And it's like, I don't it's not that I don't understand why Israel [[02:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=7385.6s)]
*  is, you know, I understand why Jews are a little on edge. [[02:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=7389.96s)]
*  I get it. Like this fuck. [[02:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=7393.360000000001s)]
*  There's so much anti-Semitism in the world. [[02:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=7394.64s)]
*  But it's like that does not you think there is in the world. [[02:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=7396.320000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I do think there's generally anti-Jewish sentiments. [[02:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=7399.92s)]
*  But I also oh, yeah, yeah, there probably is. [[02:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=7402.400000000001s)]
*  But but I also think like that doesn't we're not talking about Jewish people. [[02:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=7404.240000000001s)]
*  We're talking about the state. We're talking about a state government. [[02:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=7407.72s)]
*  We're talking about Israel. [[02:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=7410.04s)]
*  We're talking about a government. [[02:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=7411.08s)]
*  And it's like that's those aren't the same thing. [[02:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=7412.76s)]
*  And a government that no has people that are extremists in it [[02:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=7414.96s)]
*  is different than, you know. [[02:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=7418.5199999999995s)]
*  Well, that Netanyahu guy seems he just seems I he gives me the creeps. [[02:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=7420.5599999999995s)]
*  Yeah, they have I mean, they have people in the government that are just like [[02:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=7425.4s)]
*  we should exterminate them. [[02:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=7429.08s)]
*  Like they're just straight up saying crazy racist shit. [[02:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=7430.08s)]
*  And it's like that has to also people also need to know that shit, too. [[02:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=7432.799999999999s)]
*  Like it's not it's especially if you were a group that somebody has already said that to. [[02:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=7436.719999999999s)]
*  But maybe that's like the thing where if like somebody says something [[02:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=7440.839999999999s)]
*  to somebody like, hey, create hate, you know, I don't know. [[02:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=7443.759999999999s)]

*  No, it is fucking heartbreak. It's completely fucked. [[02:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=7453.2s)]
*  And now there's too much visibility now where we are in, like with social media, [[02:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=7455.52s)]
*  everything for people not to see what's going on. [[02:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=7459.84s)]
*  I do think and I also think there's like a generation of people that like [[02:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=7462.4s)]
*  for younger people, it's like they're just seeing what's going on right now. [[02:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=7466.32s)]
*  You know what I mean? They're just like this is fucked up. [[02:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=7470.4s)]
*  Like you can have any, you know, any [[02:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=7472.56s)]
*  you can have the reasons you're doing this. [[02:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=7476.120000000001s)]
*  But like we're we're 19. [[02:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=7477.88s)]
*  We're living through this moment right now. [[02:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=7479.6s)]
*  And we're we can't believe what the right and they don't look at the history of stuff [[02:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=7481.400000000001s)]
*  because they don't really have a long history in their lives yet. [[02:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=7484.76s)]
*  So they don't really history is not a part of things to them. [[02:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=7487.280000000001s)]
*  It's like what's happening right now. [[02:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=7489.400000000001s)]
*  How does it look right now? Yeah. [[02:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=7491.120000000001s)]

*  But it's also I do think obviously you should know proper context [[02:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=7496.040000000001s)]
*  and you should do your research. Yeah. [[02:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=7499.320000000001s)]
*  But I also do think there is something to that idea of like [[02:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=7500.52s)]
*  it's also free of a lot of thinking where it's like, oh, yeah, we're just [[02:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=7503.76s)]
*  we're just taking these at face value. [[02:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=7508.080000000001s)]
*  Like we're just seeing this and this is not acceptable to us. [[02:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=7509.72s)]
*  But who knows? We obviously I'm not I'm not the guest for [[02:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjhSi25tIyo&t=7512.72s)]
