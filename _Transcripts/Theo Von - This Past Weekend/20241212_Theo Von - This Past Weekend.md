*  I will sing it just for you [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=107.28s)]
*  Just for you [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=110.28s)]
*  And I've been moving way too fast [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=117.28s)]
*  And just wanna let you know, we're just excited you're here, [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=119.28s)]
*  and we don't have any, this isn't like a got you podcast, [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=121.44s)]
*  we're not trying to do anything uncomfortable. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=124.44s)]
*  Obviously you've had a very unique life, [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=127.56s)]
*  and we just wanna, I think we're curious about it. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=129.96s)]
*  Well two episodes ago you had Ryan Martin, [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=134.0s)]
*  and I learned one big thing on thinking about [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=137.16s)]
*  what he had said, so I'm prepared to even mention that [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=141.6s)]
*  because he made me realize something, [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=146.68s)]
*  which I won't be able to do anything about, [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=150.64s)]
*  but at least understanding helps. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=152.2s)]
*  Oh, about anger. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=154.88s)]
*  Yes. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=156.04s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, he's, yeah, I thought Ryan Martin [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=156.88s)]
*  was really interesting, he's a professor over in Green Bay, [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=159.24s)]
*  because I think anger is something that's kind of [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=161.88s)]
*  enveloping people a lot these days, you know? [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=163.72s)]
*  I find it a lot in myself, and you'll almost get, [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=166.0s)]
*  obviously it's kind of embarrassing, you know? [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=169.24s)]
*  It's a weird feeling that's like, you know, [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=171.68s)]
*  it can lead to a lot of negativity, [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=173.88s)]
*  it can lead to dangerous activities, [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=175.36s)]
*  but it also, I feel you get embarrassed of it, you know? [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=177.68s)]
*  And it kind of just takes you over. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=180.4s)]
*  Well in my case it's tied in with some traumatic stress, [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=181.92000000000002s)]
*  and my deal is I learned the hard way [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=186.60000000000002s)]
*  that no good deed goes unpunished. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=189.32s)]
*  I learned that a person who's basically honest [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=191.96s)]
*  will never be able to successfully deal with a person [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=195.04s)]
*  who lies for a living. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=198.35999999999999s)]
*  That's very frustrating because I have to keep it in. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=201.2s)]
*  Someday somebody may be able to deal with it [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=204.48s)]
*  maybe with some help from me. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=208.56s)]
*  Someday some situations may turn into some real drama, [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=210.68s)]
*  possibly criminal referrals, but I'm the kind of guy [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=217.23999999999998s)]
*  who people for years have been telling me [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=220.51999999999998s)]
*  that some areas I just don't have the skills [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=224.36s)]
*  and I contribute by not talking. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=228.56s)]
*  So do you feel like you're kind of a quiet guy sometimes? [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=232.96s)]
*  Generally quiet, generally restrained, [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=236.56s)]
*  except for reasons of comedy. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=239.64000000000001s)]
*  I know that I'm not as funny as I think I am, [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=243.60000000000002s)]
*  and yet I tell my philanthropic grantees [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=249.96s)]
*  that I would like for them to tolerate my sense of humor [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=254.16s)]
*  but not encourage me. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=258.36s)]
*  And so far that's worked out well, [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=260.88s)]
*  particularly last night the Bob Woodruff thing. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=263.64s)]
*  I did briefly hang out. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=266.88s)]
*  What was it last night? [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=268.52s)]
*  Just so we can tell our listeners now? [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=269.36s)]
*  Yeah, last night there was a fundraiser [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=271.52s)]
*  for the Bob Woodruff Foundation. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=275.44s)]
*  They run a network called Got Your Six. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=277.88s)]
*  Got Your Six? [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=280.24s)]
*  Got Your Six, like in the military sense. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=281.15999999999997s)]
*  Got Your Bet. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=283.48s)]
*  Yeah, and about 350 organizations [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=284.44s)]
*  who are actually good at helping. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=287.8s)]
*  And many philanthropic organizations are challenged [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=290.0s)]
*  when it comes to actually helping, [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=294.44s)]
*  but these guys are good. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=296.68s)]
*  They need a lot of money to help out vets [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=298.20000000000005s)]
*  and their families. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=301.12s)]
*  And this was both a comedy concert and a music concert. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=302.92s)]
*  The guy is, I think it was Mark Normand. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=307.16s)]
*  Oh, Mark Normand was there? [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=310.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=310.84000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, he's great. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=311.68s)]
*  Both from New Orleans. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=312.56s)]
*  Well, starting from there, there's Jim Gaffigan. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=313.88s)]
*  Wow. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=318.47999999999996s)]
*  Joey Seinfeld and John Stewart on the comedy side, [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=319.79999999999995s)]
*  which was great for me. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=325.03999999999996s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=326.76s)]
*  And then on the music side, Nora Jones, [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=327.76s)]
*  and then there's this guy, Springsteen. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=330.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=334.28s)]
*  I had spoken to him before. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=335.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=336.44s)]
*  And I told him that as a nerd, [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=337.28s)]
*  I understood that he was very popular, [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=341.12s)]
*  but that I don't know his music. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=344.36s)]
*  And he reacted quite satisfactorily. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=346.76s)]
*  His jaw dropped. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=352.96s)]
*  His wife, this was a few years ago, [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=354.64s)]
*  his wife got the joke immediately. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=356.96s)]
*  The better part of the joke is I was being literal. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=359.8s)]
*  I really am a nerd. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=362.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=363.76s)]
*  I'm the kind of guy in the late 60s in high school, [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=364.6s)]
*  I wore a plastic pocket protector, [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=369.8s)]
*  thick black glasses taped together, no social skills. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=372.08000000000004s)]
*  So you really, did you kind of embody that nerd vibe? [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=375.52000000000004s)]
*  You were like, you saw a nerd and you were like, [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=379.08000000000004s)]
*  I'm gonna be over here, I'll be there. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=381.12s)]
*  I had to originate the thing. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=382.64000000000004s)]
*  Wow, this is you right here. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=384.56s)]
*  You found the store of old photos. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=386.6s)]
*  Oh wow, yeah. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=390.68s)]
*  That's me in high school. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=391.52000000000004s)]
*  That's nice. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=392.56s)]
*  Those are the thick black glasses. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=393.40000000000003s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=394.8s)]
*  Not taped together at the time. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=395.64000000000004s)]
*  Now see, I can simulate or fake [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=397.88s)]
*  normal human social behavior now, [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=400.96s)]
*  but it is a simulation. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=403.62s)]
*  I have to work hard on it all the time. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=405.52s)]
*  And after a while I will start getting cranky. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=410.32s)]
*  Okay. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=414.6s)]
*  But the nerd cliche originated right around [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=415.44s)]
*  when I was around, so I do take credit for it. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=418.32s)]
*  Well, we're glad to have one of the most [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=421.2s)]
*  nerd-torious humans, Craig Newmark. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=424.64000000000004s)]
*  Thanks for hanging out, man. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=428.68s)]
*  I appreciate it. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=430.42s)]
*  You know, we're in the Chelsea Hotel number two. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=431.26000000000005s)]
*  Do you know that? [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=433.70000000000005s)]
*  I know you're a Leonard Cohen fan. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=434.54s)]
*  Yes. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=435.88s)]
*  And this is, he had songs based that were based out of here. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=436.72s)]
*  I think he spent time with Janis Joplin here. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=439.76000000000005s)]
*  He did. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=441.72s)]
*  Yeah, allegedly. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=442.56s)]
*  Well, near where I live, in the village, [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=443.38s)]
*  not far away, walking distance, [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=449.12s)]
*  I have a friend, my comedy consultant, [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=451.67999999999995s)]
*  and he lived here during that heyday. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=454.91999999999996s)]
*  He knew both of them and others. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=457.44s)]
*  He was intimidated by Leonard Cohen. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=460.79999999999995s)]
*  See, this friend was in the process of transitioning [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=464.15999999999997s)]
*  from music to comedy, which turned out to be easier [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=466.79999999999995s)]
*  for him to do. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=470.64s)]
*  He was really big in the 70s and 80s. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=471.59999999999997s)]
*  He may not have invested well, [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=475.08s)]
*  because I saw him yesterday, [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=477.35999999999996s)]
*  but he's much funnier than I am, for real. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=482.52s)]
*  Yeah, okay. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=485.71999999999997s)]
*  And that's why I know that I'm not as funny [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=486.76s)]
*  as I think I am. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=490.15999999999997s)]
*  Very fair. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=491.24s)]
*  You're doing okay with me so far. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=492.08s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=495.79999999999995s)]
*  If I knew you better, I'd, I believe comedians, [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=496.71999999999997s)]
*  indulging in a practice called breaking balls. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=500.03999999999996s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=504.56s)]
*  I will introduce my friends sometimes [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=505.4s)]
*  as a guy who used to be funny. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=507.47999999999996s)]
*  I will tell him, oh yeah, comedy requires [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=510.2s)]
*  actually funny material. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=513.72s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, that's a good starting point. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=515.6s)]
*  But he's given me a couple jokes to use, [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=518.84s)]
*  reminding me that at his age and my age, [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=522.0s)]
*  when you get down to tie your shoes, [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=525.1999999999999s)]
*  you look around and you think, [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=528.0799999999999s)]
*  what else can I do while I'm down here? [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=529.4399999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=531.8s)]
*  And unfortunately, that's turned true. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=532.64s)]
*  When I do get down, I have some worries [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=536.48s)]
*  about being able to get back up again. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=540.0799999999999s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=541.64s)]
*  Once you get down to the ground floor again, [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=542.48s)]
*  sometimes you kind of want to stay down there. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=543.8s)]
*  I used to, we used to listen to Leonard Cohen [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=545.68s)]
*  when I was a kid. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=548.84s)]
*  My mom would put it on when we would, [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=549.68s)]
*  when we would have to clean the house on Saturdays [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=551.68s)]
*  and my mom would put it on. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=553.72s)]
*  I remember that song, [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=556.36s)]
*  when the walls came down. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=557.84s)]
*  Okay, that's older school even for Leonard. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=560.9599999999999s)]
*  All the way to hell. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=564.4399999999999s)]
*  And we'd be like, all right, I'll clean. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=566.36s)]
*  Yeah, I vaguely remembered him, [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=568.52s)]
*  well, in like 88 or so, [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=572.76s)]
*  I'm Your Man premiered and I love that. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=575.88s)]
*  First we'll take Manhattan [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=579.36s)]
*  and then I found various positions. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=581.0799999999999s)]
*  What is that first, we'll take Manhattan? [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=584.04s)]
*  Then we'll take Berlin. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=587.48s)]
*  Then we'll take Berlin. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=588.88s)]
*  Yeah, dude, that's crazy. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=590.04s)]
*  Those lyrics have mildly been in my head over the years [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=592.16s)]
*  and I didn't even know that that's where they were from. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=594.2s)]
*  They were from Leonard Cohen. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=596.36s)]
*  Yeah, he influenced a lot of musicians after. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=597.88s)]
*  He's my favorite too in an obsessive way. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=602.36s)]
*  And now then when I'm in the right mood, [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=606.56s)]
*  I will listen to him. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=608.96s)]
*  He's not cheerful by the way [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=610.52s)]
*  most people will think about him. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=614.24s)]
*  He's a little dark. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=615.76s)]
*  Yeah, but he's uplifting if you're into it. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=616.72s)]
*  Yeah, he reminds me of a kind of a darker Anthony Bourdain [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=620.8399999999999s)]
*  of music in a way. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=623.7199999999999s)]
*  I haven't thought about that [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=625.1999999999999s)]
*  but I'm trying not to think too much about food. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=627.7199999999999s)]
*  Okay, okay. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=631.5999999999999s)]
*  Well, my problem simply is that [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=634.4399999999999s)]
*  since I've been on the run all morning, [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=636.4399999999999s)]
*  I did pass a place which had what looked like [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=638.4399999999999s)]
*  a good slice of pumpkin pie. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=641.9599999999999s)]
*  Oh yeah, brother. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=644.5999999999999s)]
*  I however may have been disappointed. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=645.92s)]
*  I think of something later this afternoon. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=648.48s)]
*  Something a little less risque, huh? [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=651.2s)]
*  Well, my problem is that food is just too delicious [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=652.8000000000001s)]
*  and it's hard to know when to stop. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=658.5600000000001s)]
*  Yeah, well it's funny because they don't put a stop sign [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=660.8000000000001s)]
*  at the bottom of a dessert or something. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=662.96s)]
*  That may or may not be helpful. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=665.72s)]
*  I will face the challenge in roughly two hours. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=668.5600000000001s)]
*  Okay, there we go. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=672.52s)]
*  Well, we have you for a limited time today. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=673.9200000000001s)]
*  I do want to talk. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=675.4s)]
*  You are the Craig from Craigslist. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=677.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=679.3199999999999s)]
*  That is true. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=680.16s)]
*  Yes. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=681.0s)]
*  Okay, and how did Craigslist start? [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=681.8399999999999s)]
*  I know that's a basic question [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=684.64s)]
*  but you don't even think about it as a regular human. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=686.0s)]
*  We don't even know that you're a real, [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=689.12s)]
*  we just, you don't even know. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=690.9599999999999s)]
*  Yeah, and I occasionally tell people [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=693.0799999999999s)]
*  that Craig is fake like Betty Crocker. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=696.7199999999999s)]
*  My deal is that I moved to San Francisco mid, well, mid 93. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=699.88s)]
*  Okay. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=704.64s)]
*  And I saw there were a lot of people [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=705.72s)]
*  helping each other out on the net, [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=707.6s)]
*  sometimes doing so, giving away expensive consulting time. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=710.6s)]
*  And I took advantage of that. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=715.64s)]
*  People helped me settle in, [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=716.96s)]
*  told me about neighborhoods and restaurants [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=718.8000000000001s)]
*  and events that I might get interested in. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=721.48s)]
*  So you were communicating on the internet [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=724.12s)]
*  just with people looking for information [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=726.12s)]
*  about living in a new area. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=728.08s)]
*  Yeah, a lot of this was from the well [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=729.96s)]
*  and early virtual community, [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=732.48s)]
*  some from Usenet newsgroups, [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=734.52s)]
*  which were the first big deal discussion boards. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=736.68s)]
*  And there is this spirit that we were all gonna use the net [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=740.16s)]
*  to help each other out. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=743.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=744.92s)]
*  So I thought I should give back, [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=745.76s)]
*  started a simple CC list, [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=747.36s)]
*  telling people about what I thought were cool events, [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=750.4399999999999s)]
*  usually arts and technology like Joe's Digital Diner [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=753.4s)]
*  or the Anon Salon, [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=758.0s)]
*  which was a party fundraiser for a local theater, [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=759.96s)]
*  highly entangled with the very earliest Burning Man. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=764.72s)]
*  And I never got involved with that [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=768.88s)]
*  because I realized that I'm not a burner at heart. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=771.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=774.5600000000001s)]
*  But this mailing list started growing via word of mouth. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=775.44s)]
*  And I started asking for more stuff than just events. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=780.84s)]
*  Like if people wanted to sell something, [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=784.6s)]
*  if people had a job or an apartment. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=787.16s)]
*  So that's how it started. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=790.4s)]
*  So you started just emailing people [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=791.24s)]
*  just with information about things to do in the area. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=792.52s)]
*  It started to grow. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=795.52s)]
*  And it was just an actual list [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=797.24s)]
*  of people you were sending a message to. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=798.4s)]
*  Yeah, it was literally an email CC list [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=799.76s)]
*  and that broke at 240 addresses. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=802.48s)]
*  I had to use a listserv. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=805.68s)]
*  I had to give the thing a name. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=807.88s)]
*  I'm very literal as a nerd. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=810.2s)]
*  I wanted to call it San Francisco events [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=812.5600000000001s)]
*  since it was still mostly that. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=815.52s)]
*  Yeah, I don't have much of an imagination. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=818.0s)]
*  Well. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=821.4s)]
*  But then I was gonna call it as if events. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=822.24s)]
*  People around me told me they had given it a name, [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=825.24s)]
*  Craigslist. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=828.96s)]
*  Ah. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=829.88s)]
*  They told me I had accidentally created a brand. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=830.84s)]
*  Then they explained to me what a brand is [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=834.92s)]
*  because I was that naive. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=837.6s)]
*  They were right. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=840.16s)]
*  Called it Craigslist. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=841.56s)]
*  Just kept growing increasingly [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=843.0s)]
*  for the first three years, just me. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=845.6s)]
*  And how often was the list going out? [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=847.84s)]
*  Whenever somebody had something, I would send it out. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=850.76s)]
*  Okay, so is that once a week or twice a month? [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=853.88s)]
*  If I was lucky, it could be, let's say, [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=856.72s)]
*  something worthwhile a few times a day. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=859.2s)]
*  Oh nice, okay. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=861.96s)]
*  The deal is not that big, but let's say high value. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=863.1600000000001s)]
*  And I was being careful. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=868.1600000000001s)]
*  I didn't want to spam anyone. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=869.64s)]
*  Right. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=871.08s)]
*  And it just kept growing via word of mouth. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=871.92s)]
*  And we'd never really done any advertising. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=875.92s)]
*  Yeah, I'd never seen it. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=878.0s)]
*  I should be careful. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=879.8399999999999s)]
*  I'll wrap around to it, [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=880.68s)]
*  but I'm not involved with the thing nowadays. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=881.64s)]
*  I'm retired, busier than I've ever been, but retired. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=884.4799999999999s)]
*  But the deal is it's just me for a few years. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=888.64s)]
*  And you're the only staff member. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=891.12s)]
*  Yes. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=892.68s)]
*  And what were some of those early high value items? [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=893.52s)]
*  What was something that would come across? [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=894.76s)]
*  Are we talking like a painting? [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=896.0799999999999s)]
*  Are we talking like a little catamaran? [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=899.88s)]
*  What are we talking? [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=902.1600000000001s)]
*  Mostly I was thinking about jobs. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=903.44s)]
*  Okay. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=906.24s)]
*  Because one of the best things you could do for someone [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=907.08s)]
*  is to help them get a job. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=910.0s)]
*  Sometimes then help them find a place to live. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=912.9200000000001s)]
*  What Craigslist is about in a lot of ways [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=917.2s)]
*  is helping people put food on the table. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=919.48s)]
*  Right, you would say, [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=922.84s)]
*  that's a great point, if you can help somebody get a job. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=923.6800000000001s)]
*  It's such a, that's residual. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=925.9200000000001s)]
*  It was completely free the first three years, [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=929.1999999999999s)]
*  but the people who were putting jobs on there [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=933.88s)]
*  wanted me to charge them to post for jobs. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=936.64s)]
*  Because they felt some like indebted in some way? [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=940.0s)]
*  Well, they felt that they were paying a lot more money [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=942.92s)]
*  for job ads in other places with fewer results, [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=947.28s)]
*  less quality results. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=950.5999999999999s)]
*  So they said, charge us a little bit, that'll pay the bills. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=952.3199999999999s)]
*  And they were right. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=958.2s)]
*  Experimented a little bit with volunteers [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=960.2800000000001s)]
*  and charging for jobs in 98, [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=963.0s)]
*  but I got the idea from people in 97. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=966.12s)]
*  Running with volunteers didn't work. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=969.6s)]
*  What do you mean running with volunteers? [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=971.5200000000001s)]
*  You mean to help you? [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=972.6s)]
*  Yes. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=973.6400000000001s)]
*  Okay, and at that point, you're just doing it [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=974.48s)]
*  out of your home? [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=975.5200000000001s)]
*  Exactly right. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=977.08s)]
*  First three years off of your home computer. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=977.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=979.5200000000001s)]
*  And how big did the email list get? [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=980.36s)]
*  Sorry, Craig. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=981.5600000000001s)]
*  I don't really know how big it got through that time. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=983.4000000000001s)]
*  Because in 96, I remembered that I'm a programmer, [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=986.72s)]
*  I can write software which turns emails into web pages. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=991.1600000000001s)]
*  And so I started doing that, [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=996.0400000000001s)]
*  which gave me web publishing for free. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=998.72s)]
*  Okay. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=1001.28s)]
*  And when something started taking too much of my time, [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=1002.28s)]
*  I wrote some more code, [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=1005.9200000000001s)]
*  which reduced what might take an hour a day [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=1007.5600000000001s)]
*  to a few minutes a day. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=1010.2s)]
*  Got it. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=1011.44s)]
*  And that happened a number of times. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=1012.28s)]
*  But 98 tried running it with volunteers. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=1014.76s)]
*  The people who cared for the thing, [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=1018.76s)]
*  who were doing job postings in particular, [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=1021.64s)]
*  said volunteer thing isn't working. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=1024.24s)]
*  Sometimes things would take a while to get posted. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=1027.1599999999999s)]
*  So I had to make the thing into a real company. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=1030.12s)]
*  Right, so at that point, [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=1032.44s)]
*  you're like if I wanted to keep this going, [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=1033.28s)]
*  it's gotta, there needs to be some checks and balances, [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=1034.8799999999999s)]
*  and obviously salaries help create that. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=1037.6s)]
*  Yeah, I need to hire other people to do coding, [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=1040.48s)]
*  customer service, billing. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=1044.3200000000002s)]
*  And that meant making it into an actual corporate structure. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=1047.5600000000002s)]
*  Was that scary to think about that? [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=1053.52s)]
*  Very scary, but the hard part was at that point, [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=1055.44s)]
*  you know, at events, parties, [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=1059.64s)]
*  I would talk to bankers and venture capitalists [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=1061.44s)]
*  who wanted me to do the usual Silicon Valley thing. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=1065.0400000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=1068.16s)]
*  They would monetize everything, [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=1069.0s)]
*  and they would throw billions at me. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=1070.52s)]
*  And I was thinking I don't need billions. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=1073.36s)]
*  I don't understand why people would do that, speaking. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=1078.24s)]
*  And that has to do with in Sunday school, Mr. and Mrs. Levin. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=1081.96s)]
*  They taught me that you should know when enough is enough. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=1086.96s)]
*  They taught me to treat people like you want to be treated. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=1090.96s)]
*  So nothing altruistic. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=1096.24s)]
*  This is just a return to Sunday school values, literally. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=1098.52s)]
*  And so we, Craig's philosophy is to monetize only those ads [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=1102.8400000000001s)]
*  for people who are paying more money [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=1108.8400000000001s)]
*  for less effective ads. [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=1111.3600000000001s)]
*  So not an altruistic decision. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=1113.3200000000002s)]
*  Right. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=1115.24s)]
*  Just basics. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=1116.52s)]
*  Yeah, but also a little bit of barrier to entry, [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=1118.6000000000001s)]
*  which not in a negative way, [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=1120.88s)]
*  because you still, everybody needs to hire someone [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=1123.24s)]
*  or has the opportunity, [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=1125.96s)]
*  and maybe they can't afford the ad, [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=1126.88s)]
*  but it provides a little more structure, too. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=1128.8400000000001s)]
*  Even just some basic, it does provide some structure, right? [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=1132.44s)]
*  Well, that's useful in the sense that, [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=1135.72s)]
*  well, everyone is struggling trying to get through the day. [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=1140.2s)]
*  Right. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=1143.7600000000002s)]
*  And some people are selling, doing things for profit, [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=1144.6000000000001s)]
*  like brokering apartments in New York City. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=1148.5200000000002s)]
*  And with, sometimes with questionable ethics. [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=1151.68s)]
*  And I found one year that new apartment brokers [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=1156.0s)]
*  might make like 20K in a year, [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=1160.28s)]
*  which even 15 years ago, [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=1163.0s)]
*  you had to work two or three other jobs. [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=1165.04s)]
*  So I said, how do you balance the idea [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=1167.52s)]
*  that you want to give everyone a break? [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=1170.28s)]
*  And I was able to suggest stuff [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=1172.76s)]
*  to the people running the company at that point, [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=1177.08s)]
*  because also in, again, [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=1179.56s)]
*  I made Craig's List into an actual company in 99. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=1181.56s)]
*  Okay, so that's when it became an actual company in 1999. [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=1185.72s)]
*  And at that point, are you guys have an office? [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=1188.76s)]
*  You guys have? [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=1190.24s)]
*  We turned it from running it in a room in my house [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=1192.64s)]
*  into a room in a commercial strip [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=1196.92s)]
*  way out in the neighborhoods of San Francisco. [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=1201.44s)]
*  Wow, that's cool. [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=1203.76s)]
*  And the other hard decision I had to make that year, 99, [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=1205.0800000000002s)]
*  was that I started to realize with help [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=1209.8s)]
*  that as a manager, I suck. [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=1213.3600000000001s)]
*  It's hard to be a manager, isn't it? [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=1216.4s)]
*  Very hard. [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=1218.0800000000002s)]
*  Because you don't realize when you're gonna go, [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=1218.92s)]
*  once you start to have employees and stuff, [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=1221.1200000000001s)]
*  you're like, suddenly I'm a boss. [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=1223.2s)]
*  And if you never wanted to be a boss, [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=1224.48s)]
*  it's a very precarious situation to be, [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=1226.4s)]
*  and I've been there, man. [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=1228.56s)]
*  What were some of the things [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=1230.16s)]
*  that you noticed you were not good at? [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=1231.0s)]
*  Well, mostly hiring and firing. [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=1233.72s)]
*  As a nerd, I am not good at reading people. [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=1237.0s)]
*  And I needed to promote someone who would be good at that. [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=1240.2s)]
*  And I had already stopped coding [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=1245.6799999999998s)]
*  because I hired a bunch of people who were better than me. [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=1247.2399999999998s)]
*  I stepped down to just do full-time customer service. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=1250.8s)]
*  I'm a great customer service rep, [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=1255.04s)]
*  not a manager of customer service, [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=1257.4399999999998s)]
*  but I was a customer service rep [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=1259.84s)]
*  and did that for maybe around 15 years. [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=1262.6s)]
*  Okay, so you ended up just being a customer service rep [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=1265.6799999999998s)]
*  at your own company. [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=1267.9599999999998s)]
*  Yes. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=1269.04s)]
*  Wow, so if somebody had a customer service issue, [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=1269.8799999999999s)]
*  they would contact you on the phone or email? [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=1271.6s)]
*  Well, with some luck, [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=1273.52s)]
*  they would contact someone else on phone first. [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=1276.08s)]
*  I took that luxury for myself [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=1280.32s)]
*  of not having to answer the phone, [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=1283.04s)]
*  but they would generally email me [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=1284.96s)]
*  because I was just Craig at craigslist.org, easy to guess. [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=1286.96s)]
*  So I spent a lot of time doing that kind of thing [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=1291.8s)]
*  and got a lot of stuff done. [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=1296.36s)]
*  And you found yourself effective there. [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=1299.44s)]
*  Yeah, well, I saw, [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=1301.76s)]
*  what I mostly saw was a lot of good. [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=1304.24s)]
*  That is, people on the net are overwhelmingly good. [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=1306.64s)]
*  The bad guys, bad actors, get a lot more press [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=1311.48s)]
*  because sometimes mainstream media generates clicks [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=1315.52s)]
*  by emphasizing the bad. [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=1319.84s)]
*  This is kind of a normal thing. [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=1321.96s)]
*  Especially nowadays. [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=1323.96s)]
*  What were some of the things you saw in there early [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=1325.04s)]
*  that helped you to believe in the good [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=1328.76s)]
*  and continue to make it go? [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=1331.84s)]
*  Consistently, I saw people helping each other out. [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=1332.84s)]
*  Consistently, I saw people give away stuff [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=1336.9199999999998s)]
*  that they could have sold for some cash. [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=1340.8799999999999s)]
*  Like sometimes you don't need the cash [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=1343.72s)]
*  and then you would just give away something of actual value [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=1347.0s)]
*  like old computer equipment. [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=1351.24s)]
*  That was pretty good. [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=1353.4399999999998s)]
*  Oh yeah, a lot of baby cribs on there, [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=1354.76s)]
*  a lot of stuff like that. [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=1356.76s)]
*  In fact, that's in particular, it's particularly true. [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=1358.44s)]
*  Baby cribs, baby carriages, and moving boxes. [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=1362.1200000000001s)]
*  Which could also be a baby carriage, [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=1367.4s)]
*  pin it on, you know. [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=1368.76s)]
*  Or a cat toy. [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=1369.76s)]
*  Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=1371.0400000000002s)]
*  But the idea is that when you move, [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=1372.3200000000002s)]
*  you have a lot of boxes which are still really good [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=1374.3600000000001s)]
*  and the chances are nearly 100%, [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=1377.88s)]
*  someone not far away needs good boxes. [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=1381.8000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, I used to live with a guy, [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=1386.5600000000002s)]
*  I lived with this guy named Kenny for a bit [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=1389.04s)]
*  and he was a pretty big stoner, right? [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=1390.04s)]
*  And I didn't know him, met him on Craigslist, right? [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=1392.8400000000001s)]
*  I get over there and I ended up living over there [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=1395.1200000000001s)]
*  and he would stack, he had a couple cats and stuff [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=1398.04s)]
*  and at night he was kind of like a, [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=1400.32s)]
*  I guess kind of an avant-garde, like circus-y, [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=1403.44s)]
*  kind of animal trainer guy. [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=1406.16s)]
*  But he would stack all the boxes, [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=1408.0s)]
*  these empty boxes in the room [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=1410.04s)]
*  and he would make the cats play on them [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=1411.2s)]
*  and he'd make me come out of my room to watch the show. [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=1413.2s)]
*  So it was crazy but it was like, [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=1417.2s)]
*  I don't know, it's something I still kind of remember about [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=1419.48s)]
*  and I guess it was pretty, I thought it was interesting. [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=1421.32s)]
*  But yeah, people use boxes, yeah. [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=1423.8s)]
*  Yeah, well the deal is that people everywhere [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=1425.84s)]
*  in the country are okay. [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=1429.08s)]
*  When you're doing customer service at that deeper level, [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=1433.8799999999999s)]
*  you see a lot of stuff and most of it is great. [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=1436.72s)]
*  I did see some stuff I wish I didn't [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=1440.08s)]
*  and that's the problem with content moderation. [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=1443.96s)]
*  It's a very tough job, especially if it's full-time [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=1446.92s)]
*  and you're not getting paid much. [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=1450.3600000000001s)]
*  And so these people are only seeing questionable stuff [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=1453.16s)]
*  and that can do some damage. [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=1456.92s)]
*  Yeah, were you, so at that point, [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=1458.56s)]
*  yeah, I guess, because Craigslist started to be this place, [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=1460.8s)]
*  it kind of became everything really fast, [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=1464.0s)]
*  is what it felt like just as a user, right? [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=1466.4s)]
*  It became like a first place where you could get a used, [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=1468.8400000000001s)]
*  you could get a blender, an air balloon or a roommate. [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=1472.04s)]
*  But then it started to escalate too, [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=1475.44s)]
*  where there was like, people would buy drugs on there [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=1477.36s)]
*  or people you'd see people like, I would do it [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=1481.36s)]
*  and you would see people, [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=1484.52s)]
*  but they also had code names for the drugs. [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=1485.68s)]
*  So it made it to be this kind of like, [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=1487.8799999999999s)]
*  it had a fun spot to it. [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=1492.76s)]
*  You'd be on there, I mean, they had like, [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=1494.56s)]
*  I remember beef jerky was a code name. [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=1496.32s)]
*  Those many bennies they had, that brain dander, [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=1499.24s)]
*  that baby hay was one of them. [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=1502.56s)]
*  I'm trying to think of any other, [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=1504.32s)]
*  that Pedrito Blanco was a span, [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=1505.52s)]
*  but you know what it was, that dragon de negro they had. [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=1507.72s)]
*  I'm trying to think of that whispering mother, [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=1512.68s)]
*  that was kind of a native one that they were, [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=1514.2s)]
*  that was Paola, whispering mother. [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=1517.76s)]
*  I know that the mainstream press [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=1518.8799999999999s)]
*  greatly exaggerated a lot of this. [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=1522.08s)]
*  They didn't point out that what you see on the street [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=1524.28s)]
*  always makes it online and online everywhere. [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=1527.6399999999999s)]
*  You guys weren't producing it. [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=1532.16s)]
*  Well, what the mainstream press doesn't point out, [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=1533.0s)]
*  that if you're a conscientious site, [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=1536.24s)]
*  you keep around the digital forensics [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=1538.96s)]
*  and because people leave a lot of trace evidence [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=1543.2s)]
*  around CSI style and that years and years ago, [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=1545.64s)]
*  I talked with a lot of cops who were real pleased [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=1551.3600000000001s)]
*  with the way that we kept around the forensics [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=1555.08s)]
*  and because of high school history, [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=1558.4s)]
*  I learned the balance between fighting crime [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=1562.3600000000001s)]
*  and the rights of the accused, [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=1565.8400000000001s)]
*  what's in the bill of rights, what's in the constitution. [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=1567.8000000000002s)]
*  Wow, so you took that upon yourself. [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=1570.68s)]
*  It must have been kind of a tough navigation. [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=1573.48s)]
*  Was it tough to navigate that personally [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=1575.44s)]
*  because you have this atmosphere that people can kind of, [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=1577.16s)]
*  it's just a pathway, right? [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=1581.0400000000002s)]
*  Well, what I did is I mentioned this to the boss [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=1583.76s)]
*  and to the lawyers and said that we gotta do this balance. [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=1588.16s)]
*  We had the advantage of having [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=1592.24s)]
*  the Electronic Frontier Foundation available [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=1593.84s)]
*  because they're the big pioneers of all this stuff online. [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=1596.56s)]
*  What does that mean, Electronic Frontier Foundation? [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=1599.3600000000001s)]
*  What they did is they're a great voice [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=1601.44s)]
*  in standing up for the rights of regular people [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=1603.76s)]
*  and that balance, you gotta do the right thing [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=1608.16s)]
*  for victims and cops. [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=1611.8s)]
*  You gotta do so in an American way, [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=1614.32s)]
*  meaning looking at the bill of rights [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=1616.68s)]
*  and if a cop wants to see the forensics, [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=1618.96s)]
*  there needs to be something like a subpoena [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=1623.48s)]
*  or a search warrant. [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=1625.24s)]
*  That's the way things are done in our country. [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=1627.4s)]
*  Those are the laws. [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=1629.68s)]
*  That's a judicial overview [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=1630.52s)]
*  and that's the ultimate purpose of that [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=1632.6399999999999s)]
*  was to prevent the kind of abuse we saw under King George, [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=1635.44s)]
*  literally speaking. [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=1640.52s)]
*  I met that really good high school history teacher. [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=1642.0s)]
*  He taught the kind of civics that you don't have nowadays [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=1644.8s)]
*  but I took this in 1970. [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=1648.1200000000001s)]
*  I'm really old. [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=1652.08s)]
*  You look great. [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=1654.1200000000001s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=1655.52s)]
*  This teacher was great [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=1656.72s)]
*  because he even took us once to a taping of a firing line, [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=1658.16s)]
*  which was William F. Buckley Jr. [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=1662.16s)]
*  He invented American conservativism, [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=1664.64s)]
*  at least the modern form of it [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=1668.1200000000001s)]
*  and that really influenced me [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=1670.0s)]
*  because at that point, I'm often a tangent, [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=1672.08s)]
*  but at that point I was looking at that. [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=1675.32s)]
*  I was starting to take a bit of a look at libertarianism, [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=1677.4s)]
*  that kind of stuff. [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=1681.0s)]
*  Again, this is more than 50 years ago. [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=1682.52s)]
*  So it's funny because you kind of ended up [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=1685.16s)]
*  in this space later on where you're like [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=1686.64s)]
*  trying to look at the ethics of communication, [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=1689.1200000000001s)]
*  who has rights, how do you protect people [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=1693.08s)]
*  but also give people the freedoms [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=1695.76s)]
*  that they deserve under their own life? [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=1697.72s)]
*  Is that what you're kind of saying? [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=1700.2s)]
*  That's pretty much it. [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=1701.48s)]
*  These days, frankly, I've given up on politics [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=1703.3600000000001s)]
*  for some years. [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=1707.0s)]
*  I now regard terms like liberal and conservative [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=1708.44s)]
*  as kind of a bullshit. [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=1711.76s)]
*  I gotta focus on helping people who protect the country. [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=1716.16s)]
*  Like there's vets in their families. [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=1721.24s)]
*  There's active service members in their families. [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=1724.24s)]
*  And right now, we're beginning to see battles on our soil, [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=1727.88s)]
*  on our own systems as a precursor to cyberspace warfare. [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=1733.96s)]
*  When you think about businesses [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=1740.1200000000001s)]
*  that are selling through the roof, [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=1741.8s)]
*  like ALO or Allbirds or Skims, [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=1744.3200000000002s)]
*  sure, you think about a great product, [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=1748.0s)]
*  a cool brand and brilliant marketing, [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=1749.72s)]
*  but an often overlooked secret [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=1752.76s)]
*  is actually the businesses behind the business, [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=1754.28s)]
*  making selling simple. [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=1758.3999999999999s)]

*  and I'm most worried about our foreign adversaries [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=1898.84s)]
*  starting to compromise our utilities, [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=1902.44s)]
*  water, power, and even our cars [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=1906.0s)]
*  because that's a thing that's happening in the here and now. [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=1909.0s)]
*  Really? [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=1912.2s)]
*  You could do a search online [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=1913.04s)]
*  for something called vault typhoon. [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=1914.68s)]
*  How do you spell it? [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=1916.8s)]
*  Vault, like electrical vault. [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=1917.68s)]
*  Okay, vault. [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=1919.32s)]
*  Typhoon like a big storm. [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=1920.16s)]
*  And the FBI have been warning everyone [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=1922.12s)]
*  that right now... [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=1924.96s)]
*  Yep, what is a vault typhoon? [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=1927.16s)]
*  A cybersecurity expert explains that Chinese hackers [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=1928.48s)]
*  targeting US critical infrastructure. [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=1930.92s)]
*  What is this? [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=1934.2s)]
*  Can you tell me a little bit about it, do you mind, Craig? [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=1935.04s)]
*  Right now, what they're doing [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=1937.16s)]
*  is they're infiltrating home systems [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=1939.0s)]
*  to be used to attack other systems. [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=1942.04s)]
*  What's worse is they're attacking [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=1944.64s)]
*  the programmable controllers [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=1946.64s)]
*  which control the flow of water into our taps. [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=1949.2s)]
*  They're controlling the flow of electricity into our homes [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=1954.3600000000001s)]
*  and a lot of those systems for much of the country [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=1957.88s)]
*  are not protected. [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=1962.1200000000001s)]
*  The deal is that most of the country, [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=1964.2s)]
*  there are rural water systems, rural electrical systems, [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=1968.28s)]
*  they don't have the resources to protect them. [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=1972.32s)]
*  So a Chinese hacker, a Chinese military hacker [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=1976.4s)]
*  could get in there. [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=1980.48s)]
*  And sway our elections and stuff? [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=1982.52s)]
*  Sway our waterways, sway if we have access to water? [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=1984.68s)]
*  Well, what they can do is turn off the water supply. [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=1987.08s)]
*  And so if, let's suppose you wanted to invade [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=1991.48s)]
*  a small island country, which was our ally. [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=1994.48s)]
*  And if the other country, our adversary, [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=1998.68s)]
*  wanted to discourage us from fighting on behalf of our ally, [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2002.76s)]
*  they could just start shutting off water and power [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2007.44s)]
*  and if they did that where you're living, [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2012.48s)]
*  that would kind of ruin your day. [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2016.0s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2017.4s)]
*  And for that matter, they could compromise cars, [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2018.64s)]
*  which are internet devices. [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2024.04s)]
*  Oh, that's true, especially as cars become more electric [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2025.4s)]
*  and more like digital, really. [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2028.44s)]
*  Yes, they could shut off your car, [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2030.3600000000001s)]
*  stall it out in the middle of rush hour traffic. [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2032.6000000000001s)]
*  If they did that in a city like New York, [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2035.72s)]
*  if they could just do 100 cars, [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2038.72s)]
*  that snarls traffic indefinitely. [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2040.72s)]
*  Wow, yeah, you do that and then they shut the power down [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2043.64s)]
*  and now things are getting really weird. [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2045.96s)]
*  Yeah, and all they would have to do is show they could do it [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2047.16s)]
*  and that's where the military is headed these days. [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2051.12s)]
*  It is not replacing shooting wars, [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2056.36s)]
*  but it's more powerful. [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2060.12s)]
*  Like in World War II, the war came to our shores [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2062.56s)]
*  a little bit and whatever's happening next, [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2066.28s)]
*  it's gonna be a much bigger thing. [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2070.0s)]
*  I'm planning to issue a national call to action [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2072.6800000000003s)]
*  wherein we tell everyone that we need to protect our homes, [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2078.1200000000003s)]
*  utility companies need to protect themselves. [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2082.6800000000003s)]
*  We're trying to build the networks of networks [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2085.6800000000003s)]
*  where everyone can protect each other. [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2087.7200000000003s)]
*  I'm not the guy to really be Paul Revere [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2090.12s)]
*  because that would require social skills. [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2095.3999999999996s)]
*  And remember, I'm a nerd. [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2099.24s)]
*  But you could be his horse maybe. [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2100.7999999999997s)]
*  Well, I need to be something, [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2102.12s)]
*  but the deal is as I issue this call to action, [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2105.0s)]
*  as I point out that many utilities are not protected, [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2108.16s)]
*  I'm gonna piss off a lot of people. [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2112.56s)]
*  You think so? [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2114.8799999999997s)]
*  Why would they be upset on understanding that part? [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2116.08s)]
*  Well, sometimes people kill the messenger. [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2117.76s)]
*  So I'll do it carefully. [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2122.2400000000002s)]
*  We're ramping up slowly. [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2123.8s)]
*  We have this pause take nine campaign. [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2126.8s)]
*  So when you get a suspicious email, that could be phishing. [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2129.6000000000004s)]
*  And our adversaries are really smart. [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2133.92s)]
*  They're as smart as our guys. [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2136.88s)]
*  And we need to know how to fight back. [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2139.1600000000003s)]
*  I need to consider helping out a new group [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2142.32s)]
*  being funded at Vanderbilt. [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2146.0s)]
*  At Vanderbilt? [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2148.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2149.52s)]
*  Oh nice, that's where I live in Tennessee. [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2150.36s)]
*  Well, they've just started within the past couple of weeks, [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2151.2400000000002s)]
*  started a new facility, [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2155.8s)]
*  which is gonna be led by General Paul Nakasone, [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2157.6s)]
*  who led, I think it was Cyber Command. [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2161.92s)]
*  And they have this philosophy of defense forward [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2164.2400000000002s)]
*  where they're not waiting for the adversary [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2167.96s)]
*  to come and get us. [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2172.32s)]
*  We're taking more active measures. [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2173.88s)]
*  And that's a big concern for you. [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2176.24s)]
*  So that's something you donate to, right? [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2177.08s)]
*  Well, that's a big area. [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2178.68s)]
*  Like one big area in veterans and military families. [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2180.6s)]
*  And I've now committed to 200 million. [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2185.7999999999997s)]
*  Wow. [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2189.2799999999997s)]
*  And I've already spent more than half of it. [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2190.12s)]
*  For cybersecurity, I've also committed [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2193.16s)]
*  a couple hundred million. [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2195.8399999999997s)]
*  This is not altruistic. [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2197.56s)]
*  This is just, well, I was raised in the 50s to be a patriot. [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2199.52s)]
*  This is just me following through with basics. [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2205.1600000000003s)]
*  And I got the cash. [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2209.0400000000004s)]
*  I'm not much for luxuries. [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2212.7200000000003s)]
*  I do get all the streaming services I want. [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2215.36s)]
*  And I do have a larger TV than I should. [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2218.84s)]
*  Yeah, I won't say anything. [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2222.2000000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2223.6000000000004s)]
*  And beyond that, well again, back to Sunday school, [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2225.2400000000002s)]
*  you wanna know when enough is enough. [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2231.6400000000003s)]
*  You have to give back. [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2233.8799999999997s)]
*  Yeah, we talk about that on here sometimes. [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2234.72s)]
*  I wonder if there should almost be a law. [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2235.7999999999997s)]
*  I mean, you couldn't make it a law, [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2237.16s)]
*  but that at a certain point, [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2238.2s)]
*  people, somebody doesn't need any more money. [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2239.68s)]
*  Because then it becomes, you see some people, [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2242.96s)]
*  they just have so, it's like, what are you doing? [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2245.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2247.56s)]
*  It becomes almost this obsessive thing where, I don't know. [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2248.4s)]
*  It seems scary to think that some people have so much money. [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2251.68s)]
*  Well, I don't judge any of that. [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2255.0s)]
*  Everyone decides what's right for themselves. [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2257.2799999999997s)]
*  And that's none of my business. [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2260.92s)]
*  I figure I should put my money where my mouth is, [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2263.52s)]
*  and then try to get some good stuff done, [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2267.44s)]

*  investing and stuff like that you mean? [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2281.04s)]

*  I do, I guess, yeah. [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2285.56s)]
*  What in the libertarian movement [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2288.88s)]
*  and the related financial stuff, [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2291.32s)]
*  in the 70s, early 70s, [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2293.44s)]
*  there was this idea of capital preservation. [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2295.6800000000003s)]
*  Because inflation was really bad then. [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2298.32s)]
*  So people were finding assets [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2300.84s)]
*  which where they could preserve their capital. [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2303.92s)]
*  Of course, I was in college, I didn't have much. [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2306.92s)]
*  Right. [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2308.84s)]
*  But I invest in the literal sense, very little. [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2309.6800000000003s)]
*  I just want to keep what I have for nonprofits [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2314.32s)]
*  and some for myself. [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2317.7200000000003s)]
*  And I want to keep that safe. [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2319.2400000000002s)]
*  And, but that's the old libertarian background. [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2322.04s)]
*  These days, my philosophy is much more mixed [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2326.96s)]
*  because I'm told in Sunday school and elsewhere [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2330.48s)]
*  that you do want to, well now and then, [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2336.24s)]
*  you go on to be your brother's or sister's keeper. [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2338.96s)]
*  Now and then you want to help people out who need a hand. [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2341.7999999999997s)]
*  How you do that effectively, [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2345.12s)]
*  no one knows the real answers for. [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2347.3599999999997s)]
*  But I can do a couple things. [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2350.08s)]
*  Not altruistic, it's just basics. [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2352.08s)]
*  And I learned all that over 60 years ago. [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2356.2400000000002s)]
*  I mean, I realized recently how formative that was. [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2360.52s)]
*  That's when I started reading science fiction. [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2363.52s)]
*  Hmm. [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2365.88s)]
*  Yeah, it's funny how those young years, [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2366.84s)]
*  there are little things you'll keep. [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2368.36s)]
*  I still remember like certain things [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2369.56s)]
*  that I told someone I would do like 25 years ago. [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2370.92s)]
*  And every day, every couple of days, [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2374.36s)]
*  someone was like, hey, don't forget, [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2375.96s)]
*  you still have to do that little thing, you know. [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2377.0s)]
*  It's funny how like those formative years [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2379.48s)]
*  and things that we hear when we're young [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2381.48s)]
*  can have such an effect on us even as we grow older. [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2384.08s)]
*  I want to talk a little bit more about the actual site. [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2389.12s)]
*  So the company starts growing, right? [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2391.64s)]
*  And in addition to people helping each other get jobs, [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2393.84s)]
*  people were helping each other, [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2397.16s)]
*  people were starting relationships on there. [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2398.44s)]
*  I went on dates off of Craigslist before, you know? [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2400.08s)]
*  Did you yourself ever go, did you? [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2404.6s)]
*  No, I always felt like a conflict of interest. [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2407.12s)]
*  Yeah, that's true. [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2410.16s)]
*  If you're like, hey, I'm Craig. [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2412.0s)]
*  Yeah, I got lucky in a local cafe. [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2413.12s)]
*  Oh, you met your wife. [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2418.84s)]
*  Your wife, okay. [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2420.56s)]
*  And we've been together for over 20 years now. [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2421.44s)]
*  Wow, and if you have some social awkwardness, [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2424.16s)]
*  what was that like for you? [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2426.24s)]
*  I decided I would take a big chance. [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2428.3199999999997s)]
*  Yeah, I've been there, dude. [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2430.92s)]
*  And told her that she's beautiful. [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2432.52s)]
*  The guy next to me, she tells me he rolled his eyes. [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2437.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2440.36s)]
*  And because he rolled his eyes, [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2441.2799999999997s)]
*  that's why she started talking to me. [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2443.52s)]
*  Oh, wow. [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2446.2799999999997s)]
*  So there was a little bit of some empathy there, [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2448.56s)]
*  human empathy. [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2450.68s)]
*  Well, it could have been a pity discussion. [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2452.64s)]
*  That's another way of saying empathy, yeah. [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2455.64s)]
*  Obviously, I charmed her. [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2457.08s)]
*  Yeah, that's the spirit. [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2460.3199999999997s)]
*  So last night we were at this fundraiser [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2461.6s)]
*  because I think she wanted to meet Jerry Seinfeld [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2465.36s)]
*  in particular, and I don't blame her. [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2468.1600000000003s)]
*  I had nothing to say, I was tongue-tied. [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2472.2400000000002s)]
*  But that's how I normally act when I talk to celebrities, [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2475.36s)]
*  particularly if you're backstage [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2482.4s)]
*  and there's a show going on. [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2484.48s)]
*  And having done a little bit of that, [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2486.52s)]
*  you gotta get your head into the moment [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2489.2400000000002s)]
*  and you don't want a distraction. [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2491.6s)]
*  Yeah, that's a good point. [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2494.8s)]
*  You just wanna kind of be a fly on the wall in some sense. [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2495.64s)]
*  Wow, so you started off, said hello in a cafe, [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2498.2799999999997s)]
*  and then how long was that, was your relationship, [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2501.48s)]
*  how long did that kind of dating life go for you guys? [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2507.24s)]
*  Well, after about nine years, I think, [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2510.44s)]
*  I brought her over to, I showed her Facebook on a screen. [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2515.04s)]
*  I don't really use it anymore, but I said, [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2519.04s)]
*  is it okay if I change my relationship status to engaged? [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2521.56s)]
*  Wow. [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2525.72s)]
*  And it took her a moment, but she said, oh, that's good. [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2526.76s)]
*  Because I calculated at that point [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2530.12s)]
*  that parental pressure had grown significantly. [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2532.92s)]
*  From yours and hers? [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2537.16s)]
*  Hers. Okay. [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2538.48s)]
*  And that worked out pretty well. [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2540.44s)]
*  That's a pretty suave online mood. [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2543.64s)]
*  That's almost the most online way [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2545.44s)]
*  you could ask someone to marry you, I feel like. [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2547.96s)]
*  Well, I hate to say it, but if you consider that suave, [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2550.32s)]
*  you may also be a bit of a nerd. [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2554.88s)]
*  I have, I think when it comes to, yeah, [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2556.8s)]
*  where it happens, yeah, there's like, yeah, [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2559.52s)]
*  talking with women, it's definitely, [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2562.48s)]
*  it's not my, you know, I wouldn't, yeah. [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2564.6800000000003s)]
*  Yeah, I. You're not, yeah. [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2568.36s)]
*  Yeah, I, okay, that's the nerd cliche again. [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2570.32s)]
*  I. Yeah. [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2573.56s)]
*  I'm still socially awkward. [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2574.96s)]
*  Sometimes I can disguise that. [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2577.6000000000004s)]
*  Yes. But that's still me. [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2579.32s)]
*  And it's not gonna change now that I'm in my sunset years. [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2582.1600000000003s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah, sometimes it doesn't go away. [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2586.4s)]
*  You just kind of start to learn it. [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2588.44s)]
*  I think I've just had the, [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2589.7200000000003s)]
*  I have the tough thing of asking a girl out. [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2591.0800000000004s)]
*  Like, sometimes I'm okay with talk. [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2593.4s)]
*  I'll get good with talking with a woman, [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2595.88s)]
*  but it's just that next part. [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2597.52s)]
*  And we'll just be standing there and we'll be like, [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2599.0s)]
*  well, somebody should ask somebody out [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2601.28s)]
*  or walk away from somebody. [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2602.8s)]
*  And then you're just still just standing there. [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2604.56s)]
*  Yeah, well, that's the purpose of Miss Connections. [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2606.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2609.48s)]
*  Which anecdotally, I know works once in a while [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2610.32s)]
*  because I've encountered over the years, [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2614.5600000000004s)]
*  a bunch of couples which had gotten married. [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2617.5600000000004s)]
*  No, off of Miss Connections. [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2621.0800000000004s)]
*  Yes. [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2622.44s)]
*  And I like that a great deal. [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2623.28s)]
*  It is romantic in a understated way. [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2625.88s)]
*  Oh yeah, well, how did that start? [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2629.48s)]
*  How did that Miss Connections start? [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2631.0800000000004s)]
*  Well, Jim decided he wanted to put it up. [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2632.5200000000004s)]
*  He was the boss then, so he did. [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2634.96s)]
*  Oh, Jim was the guy running the company at that point? [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2636.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2639.32s)]
*  When I realized that, again, I'm a terrible manager, [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2640.52s)]
*  I'd already hired Jim, who's a good manager. [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2644.12s)]
*  Jim, what's his name? [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2646.92s)]
*  Jim Buckmaster. [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2647.76s)]
*  Jim Buckmaster, yeah. [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2648.6s)]
*  You'll see pictures of us together. [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2649.8s)]
*  And if it looks like we're at eye level, [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2652.92s)]
*  it's because I'm standing on a box. [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2655.28s)]
*  Okay. [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2657.28s)]
*  He's a smaller guy? [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2658.12s)]
*  He's a foot taller than me. [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2660.44s)]
*  He's a taller guy, okay. [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2663.0s)]
*  So it makes for a good, there we go. [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2663.88s)]
*  Oh, there you are. [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2666.28s)]
*  You actually did have your box. [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2667.1200000000003s)]
*  That's the old office space, [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2668.08s)]
*  and I was the one who suggested the gag there. [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2670.92s)]
*  Yeah, that's right. [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2676.6000000000004s)]
*  And kudos to your guys for being really good [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2678.04s)]
*  at pulling stuff up. [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2680.56s)]
*  Craigslist.org, yeah, man. [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2682.6800000000003s)]
*  When you guys were the first one to do .org, [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2685.1600000000003s)]
*  people were like, what is it? [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2687.56s)]
*  People thought it meant Oregon. [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2688.6000000000004s)]
*  People didn't even know what, you know, where is it? [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2690.44s)]
*  Well, it was an early use of it, [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2692.2s)]
*  and our approach was to be this minimal monetization thing, [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2694.6s)]
*  and there's no category for that online. [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2699.96s)]
*  So that caught the spirit and worked. [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2702.8399999999997s)]
*  Yeah, and so Miss Connections, [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2706.48s)]
*  do you remember like the first Miss Connection [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2709.12s)]
*  that was ever put up, or the first personal [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2710.8799999999997s)]
*  that was ever put up? [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2712.52s)]
*  I'm sure people ask you that a lot. [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2713.3599999999997s)]
*  Don't remember much of that at all. [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2714.4399999999996s)]
*  Everything is a blur, and unfortunately, [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2719.0s)]
*  I wasn't smart enough to keep a lot of records, [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2721.36s)]
*  and so a lot is lost. [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2725.32s)]
*  Like from the internet archive and the Wayback Machine, [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2728.1600000000003s)]
*  I could see the first site that I put up was mid or late 96, [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2732.7200000000003s)]
*  and that was pretty good, [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2738.6400000000003s)]
*  and I evolved that kind of minimal style. [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2741.44s)]
*  Like right now our site hasn't changed much in appearance [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2744.76s)]
*  in 30 years. [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2749.36s)]
*  Why is that? [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2750.64s)]
*  Well, I talk to a lot of people, [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2751.48s)]
*  and they want it simple, fast, effective. [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2754.64s)]
*  They want what you see is what you get, [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2757.8799999999997s)]
*  and we've heard from a lot of designers who want fancy, [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2760.52s)]
*  and fancy may not be the answer for a lot of things. [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2765.4s)]
*  Sometimes, you know, you do see something [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2771.92s)]
*  which is impressive, fancy and yet effective, [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2774.16s)]
*  but that seems to be the minority. [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2777.92s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah, this is you know what you want. [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2781.04s)]
*  What do you want? [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2783.52s)]
*  You want heavy equipment outside of South Jersey. [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2784.44s)]
*  What do you want? [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2787.04s)]
*  You want biotech out in Mendocino. [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2788.32s)]
*  You want legal issues. [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2792.8s)]
*  You want rideshares. [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2795.44s)]
*  You want rodeo interests outside of Fort Worth. [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2796.48s)]
*  It's just, it's all right there. [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2798.8s)]
*  You can put it together quick. [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2801.0s)]
*  Even a simple, even someone who isn't technologically [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2802.08s)]
*  advanced could go here, [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2804.64s)]
*  and even the terms you have on there, [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2807.04s)]
*  it's like childcare, right? [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2809.64s)]
*  Pets, rants and raves. [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2811.56s)]
*  It's just, it's everything you could need [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2813.08s)]
*  is kind of right here. [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2815.6s)]
*  And that means the site is always fast. [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2817.04s)]
*  And it's- [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2821.0s)]
*  Oh, because it's not a lot of big background. [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2821.84s)]
*  Wow. [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2823.96s)]
*  And see, we've helped people in the tens of millions [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2824.8s)]
*  or more put food on the table. [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2829.36s)]
*  But also- What jobs you mean? [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2831.96s)]
*  And selling things. [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2833.04s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2834.48s)]
*  Okay. [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2835.32s)]
*  And advertising services. [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2836.14s)]
*  But also, the site is so simple. [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2837.8599999999997s)]
*  We've shown tens or maybe hundreds of millions of Americans [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2841.8599999999997s)]
*  that the internet could be useful [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2847.3799999999997s)]
*  and reasonably easy to use. [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2851.1s)]
*  And that meant a lot of people [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2853.7s)]
*  who may have been hesitant to get on the net, [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2856.62s)]
*  they get on the net. [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2859.7s)]
*  And again, that's fairness for everyone. [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2861.06s)]
*  That's treating people like you want to be treated. [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2863.7799999999997s)]
*  And that ain't bad. [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2866.8199999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2868.5s)]
*  Fairness, that's an important word, huh? [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2869.3399999999997s)]
*  It's important to you. [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2871.46s)]
*  Very much so. [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2873.2999999999997s)]
*  Because you try, sometimes it's hard. [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2874.8199999999997s)]
*  There are often tough decisions to be made. [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2879.14s)]
*  But Jim took over that for the company. [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2883.8199999999997s)]
*  And maybe he's done a better job than Iver could. [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2886.7999999999997s)]
*  And I did make for a great customer service rep. [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2890.3199999999997s)]
*  What made you choose Jim Buckmaster? [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2894.66s)]
*  What was it about him when you interviewed him? [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2895.7799999999997s)]
*  He believed in the mission. [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2898.5s)]
*  And he was good on the technology side [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2900.62s)]
*  because he, in a way, had two jobs, [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2904.42s)]
*  manager and programmer, [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2907.7799999999997s)]
*  because getting good programmers is hard. [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2910.3799999999997s)]
*  And Jim, over time, hired a tech staff, [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2914.54s)]
*  everyone better at the job than I was. [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2918.3599999999997s)]
*  Wow. [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2921.46s)]
*  It's also cool to hear you recognize that. [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2923.42s)]
*  These people are better than I was. [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2925.46s)]
*  To learn where your spaces were best. [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2926.78s)]
*  Yeah, I'm funnier than any of them are. [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2930.02s)]
*  Of course. [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2932.62s)]
*  That may not be a high bar. [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2935.1s)]
*  They did sometimes do great things. [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2938.46s)]
*  And they would sometimes pull out great ads of all sorts, [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2940.46s)]
*  particularly Miss Connections, [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2945.7400000000002s)]
*  and for a while ran a running best of Craigslist. [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2947.86s)]
*  Although I haven't looked at that in a while, [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2952.22s)]
*  you see with the philanthropy stuff I'm doing, [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2955.2999999999997s)]
*  that's consuming. [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2958.58s)]
*  I'm now working harder than I've ever been. [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2960.02s)]
*  Wow. [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2962.2999999999997s)]
*  Because I guess I am in a mission. [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2963.7799999999997s)]
*  Vets and their families need our help. [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2967.62s)]
*  So that's one of your important causes. [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2969.4199999999996s)]
*  Independent journalism, veterans, [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2971.02s)]
*  what is another philanthropic cause you enjoy? [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2974.74s)]
*  Specifically also active service members and their families [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2977.14s)]
*  Without going on in length, [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2981.3s)]
*  I'm shocked that military families aren't paid enough [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2982.98s)]
*  to get both a good place to live and food. [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2987.6200000000003s)]
*  And the model used to be, [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2993.1000000000004s)]
*  the volunteer army would be single guys. [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2995.26s)]
*  Well, there's a lot of families. [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=2998.1000000000004s)]
*  They're relocated about 600,000 times a year. [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3000.6600000000003s)]
*  And that's where Blue Star Families comes in. [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3004.5s)]
*  I can go on at great length and I think I'll stop there. [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3007.34s)]
*  But that's the name of an organization [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3010.18s)]
*  that you help support? [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3011.3399999999997s)]
*  Yes. [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3012.2599999999998s)]
*  Bob Woodruff Foundation for Vets, [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3013.22s)]
*  25 million from last night. [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3015.62s)]
*  And I happen to have a meeting, [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3018.42s)]
*  an event with Blue Star Families, [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3020.8599999999997s)]
*  which could also use something like that, [[00:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3023.8199999999997s)]
*  but which I won't pre-announce. [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3026.66s)]
*  A fundraising event. [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3028.3399999999997s)]
*  Well, if you guys ever need a comedian, [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3029.42s)]
*  I'd love to come. [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3030.58s)]
*  I can't believe it. [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3031.42s)]
*  I wish I'd have known last night. [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3032.2599999999998s)]
*  I would have gone. [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3033.58s)]
*  That would have been awesome. [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3034.42s)]
*  Well, the connection is through Caroline Hirsch, [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3035.2599999999998s)]
*  who used to run Caroline's [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3038.58s)]
*  and now runs the New York Comedy Festival. [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3040.22s)]
*  Yeah, that's going on this week. [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3042.7s)]
*  Yeah, that's a world I know nothing about. [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3043.82s)]
*  I kind of would like to, [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3047.62s)]
*  but people are busy. [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3050.62s)]
*  I should do other things. [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3053.9s)]
*  The Comedy Cellar is down the street from me. [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3055.3s)]
*  I've never gone in. [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3058.66s)]
*  Really? [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3059.94s)]
*  Yeah, well, they seem to be booked all the time. [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3060.7799999999997s)]
*  Yeah, they're pretty, [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3063.46s)]
*  and it's limited seating too in there. [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3064.3s)]
*  Yeah, and they're supposed to open [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3065.98s)]
*  at least one more space. [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3067.58s)]
*  And yeah, I should get off my butt and do something, [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3069.74s)]
*  but there's always lots more work. [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3076.66s)]
*  Not only my own work, [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3080.22s)]
*  but let's say my in-laws need some help. [[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3081.3s)]
*  Oh yeah, they always do. [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3083.46s)]
*  Fortunately, we can do a good job about that, [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3085.9s)]
*  but I got to stay focused on the areas [[00:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3089.14s)]
*  where I'm doing some good. [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3092.54s)]
*  The cybersecurity part is part of that [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3094.18s)]
*  because this is the new war. [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3097.62s)]
*  And did you start to learn, [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3101.5s)]
*  where did that interest come from? [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3103.74s)]
*  Or where did that realization [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3105.46s)]
*  that cybersecurity is going to be such a big thing? [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3107.14s)]
*  Was there a lot of attacks on security at Craigslist? [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3109.3399999999997s)]
*  Did that happen? [[00:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3113.94s)]
*  Well, there was always something, [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3115.06s)]
*  but we had a good team for that. [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3116.66s)]
*  Right, but did you have to have that? [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3118.2599999999998s)]
*  Say if someone was attacking Craigslist, [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3120.46s)]
*  this is what I'm asking. [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3122.06s)]
*  What would they be trying to get? [[00:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3123.06s)]
*  Well, they would be trying to disrupt service. [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3125.38s)]
*  They would try to steal proprietary information, [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3129.06s)]
*  which did happen. [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3134.38s)]
*  What does proprietary information mean? [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3135.58s)]
*  I'm sorry, Craig. [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3136.86s)]
*  Proprietary information at any company [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3137.7s)]
*  is like secret information, like payroll, client list. [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3140.02s)]
*  We didn't have much of that [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3144.94s)]
*  because we are a simple classified site. [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3146.1s)]
*  But people thought that we had some, [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3149.2999999999997s)]
*  quote unquote, secret sauce. [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3153.3399999999997s)]
*  Yeah, some big fancy stuff. [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3154.3399999999997s)]
*  And the irony is that that was never the case. [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3156.7s)]
*  And yet people tried to do things. [[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3161.46s)]
*  There were some problems with leakages of that information. [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3164.2999999999997s)]
*  But the problem that I'm not concerned [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3168.4199999999996s)]
*  with that at Craigslist now, [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3172.3399999999997s)]
*  I am concerned, well, I've been reading about this [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3175.2999999999997s)]
*  for decades. [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3177.9399999999996s)]
*  And now I see that an adversary would do something like, [[00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3179.3s)]
*  well, they would try to, [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3184.6600000000003s)]
*  a form of warfare would be to try to jam or hack a drone. [[00:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3187.86s)]
*  If they turn your drone against you, [[00:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3193.38s)]
*  you're gonna have a bad day. [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3196.0600000000004s)]
*  If it's an autonomous drone, [[00:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3197.5800000000004s)]
*  one that's figuring out where the enemy is for itself, [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3199.54s)]
*  if they could subvert it, [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3203.38s)]
*  they would turn our autonomous drone [[00:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3205.34s)]
*  back against us. [[00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3210.14s)]
*  That would make for someone's bad day. [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3211.06s)]
*  Yeah, imagine if we sent out a drone [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3213.06s)]
*  and it's supposed to get information, [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3215.18s)]
*  send it to an artillery unit or a missile [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3216.9399999999996s)]
*  that's supposed to fire automatically [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3221.2599999999998s)]
*  from the information from that drone [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3222.8599999999997s)]
*  and they're able to hack it. [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3224.1s)]
*  You could literally, our army could do it themselves. [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3225.14s)]
*  There's a lot of mundane things [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3228.8599999999997s)]
*  like our hot water heaters at home [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3231.3799999999997s)]
*  are becoming internet connected, [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3236.7000000000003s)]
*  so sometimes they could diagnose it remotely. [[00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3239.58s)]
*  Boilers like that in factories. [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3242.62s)]
*  There are painting robots. [[00:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3246.02s)]
*  And those things, if hacked, [[00:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3247.94s)]
*  they could start running them at high. [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3250.42s)]
*  Another could be just told to run at high [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3253.6600000000003s)]
*  until it burns, causes a fire. [[00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3257.5s)]
*  And if there's a few fires like that, [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3261.06s)]
*  your first responders can deal. [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3263.26s)]
*  But if there's a thousand, you have a problem. [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3266.58s)]
*  Yeah, if somebody hacks your oven, [[00:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3268.7400000000002s)]
*  you don't even think about that. [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3270.06s)]
*  Somebody hacks your ovens, [[00:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3271.1s)]
*  next thing you know there's 1,100 fires in an area. [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3272.3s)]
*  Now the deal is that there's room for optimism, [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3275.3s)]
*  for help, because there are already people [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3278.5s)]
*  who are really good at dealing with this. [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3281.58s)]
*  What I'm doing is gathering together, [[00:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3284.02s)]
*  funding them so that they could work together, [[00:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3287.54s)]
*  starting to work with local governments everywhere, [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3290.22s)]
*  everywhere through the country. [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3293.62s)]
*  Starting to come up with, let's say, some best practices, [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3296.18s)]
*  because we have some breathing space, we think. [[00:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3299.38s)]
*  Got it. [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3302.02s)]
*  And the idea is that water supplies, power supplies, [[00:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3303.7400000000002s)]
*  they also go down because of natural disasters. [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3307.98s)]
*  They need to be resilient. [[00:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3311.26s)]
*  They need to be where you knock them down, [[00:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3313.02s)]
*  they can come back up in a small amount of time. [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3315.3s)]
*  Well, it's even funny, even with drones, [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3319.42s)]
*  when I was a kid you had to do [[00:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3321.06s)]
*  a little bit of peeping, tomming, right? [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3322.1s)]
*  If you wanted to look into somebody's window, [[00:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3324.18s)]
*  you had to go over there. [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3326.5800000000004s)]
*  I don't know anything about that. [[00:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3327.42s)]
*  Yeah, I'm not saying you do. [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3328.94s)]
*  Yeah, and I'm not saying I do, you know what I'm saying? [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3330.34s)]
*  But I do, I know. [[00:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3333.38s)]
*  But yeah, somebody here does and it's me. [[00:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3335.2200000000003s)]
*  But what I'm saying is this, [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3338.34s)]
*  now as a kid you can use a drone. [[00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3339.5s)]
*  And that's the laziest thing. [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3342.98s)]
*  You had to go risk getting beat up by a woman's husband [[00:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3344.7000000000003s)]
*  to look in their window, [[00:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3348.7000000000003s)]
*  even if they were just cooking or whatever, right? [[00:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3349.6600000000003s)]
*  I'm not getting lewd with it, I'm just saying, you know. [[00:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3352.2200000000003s)]
*  But now you can just get a drone and go do it. [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3354.98s)]
*  It's like, just breaks my heart, some of that kind of stuff. [[00:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3357.3s)]
*  In Manhattan, apparently that's illegal. [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3360.5s)]
*  And like, oh, right now I wonder, I like my tech toys. [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3364.62s)]
*  I would get a drone and I would be bored with it [[00:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3370.86s)]
*  after a few minutes. [[00:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3373.06s)]
*  My neighbor kids would enjoy it [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3374.7000000000003s)]
*  because they would learn how to use it really well. [[00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3376.94s)]
*  And their parents have vetoed the idea [[00:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3379.2200000000003s)]
*  for the reason you mentioned. [[00:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3382.54s)]
*  I'm sure, I didn't even think about that. [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3383.9s)]
*  Yeah, because I'm still like just squinting real hard [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3385.78s)]
*  and hoping I'm seeing something. [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3388.1s)]
*  Well, it's a big problem in New York. [[00:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3389.94s)]
*  I bet, that's awesome. [[00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3392.5s)]
*  Lots of big problems, lots of big cities all near each other [[00:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3394.02s)]
*  and a contested airspace [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3398.38s)]
*  because we need the cops to have drones. [[00:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3400.94s)]
*  That's just getting crazy. [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3404.38s)]
*  You know, yeah, you don't think about all those things. [[00:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3405.9s)]
*  You don't think about all the ways that we could be hacked [[00:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3409.42s)]
*  and the immediate effects of it, you know? [[00:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3411.34s)]
*  So we need to protect ourselves in all sorts of ways. [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3413.3s)]
*  And that's why the idea is to build networks [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3417.26s)]
*  of volunteers who are running, [[00:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3421.3s)]
*  let's say the nonprofit world, the NGO world. [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3426.3s)]
*  And that way then they cooperate with other parties. [[00:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3430.18s)]
*  But we do have to, well, it's like World War II. [[00:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3433.7400000000002s)]
*  We looked out for each other. [[00:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3437.78s)]
*  Everyone tried to play their part. [[00:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3439.42s)]
*  And the looking out for each other in that positive way [[00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3441.86s)]
*  isn't bad. [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3446.54s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3447.5s)]
*  And like right now, if something starts happening weird [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3448.34s)]
*  with my baby camera equivalent, [[00:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3454.7000000000003s)]
*  I would like to be able to get help from someone. [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3457.9s)]
*  Right. [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3460.26s)]
*  And even worse, if the oven started running away, [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3461.3s)]
*  I would want to know what to do about that. [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3466.2200000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3468.38s)]
*  When Craigslist, when you, at what point were there ever [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3470.14s)]
*  like categories that you wouldn't do? [[00:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3478.06s)]
*  Were there ever? [[00:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3480.98s)]
*  Right, very early on, we heard in large numbers [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3483.38s)]
*  that people didn't want gun sales on the site. [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3487.2999999999997s)]
*  And there I am thinking, [[00:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3492.38s)]
*  because I saw some influence then, [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3493.7s)]
*  there are constitutional rights there. [[00:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3496.2599999999998s)]
*  But one of them is property rights. [[00:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3499.66s)]
*  So if you have a site, it's your property, [[00:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3502.2999999999997s)]
*  you get to set the rules. [[00:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3506.06s)]
*  So you decide what's right and wrong there. [[00:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3507.74s)]
*  So I believe in property rights and freedom of choice. [[00:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3511.18s)]
*  And that's what you exercise. [[00:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3515.2999999999997s)]
*  And that's what people do through the net. [[00:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3517.42s)]
*  It's your site, your thing, you decide what the rules are. [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3520.74s)]
*  So you were able to, so you actually got to decide [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3524.9s)]
*  that or not decided, or you and your team? [[00:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3527.14s)]
*  I had an opinion, but I wanted the team as such as it was [[00:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3530.02s)]
*  to work it out. [[00:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3535.5s)]
*  That was a little bit of good management, [[00:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3537.94s)]
*  but I couldn't consistently deliver good leadership. [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3541.5s)]
*  And even now I'm not a top down kind of leader. [[00:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3546.5s)]
*  Maybe I could lead by example. [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3550.38s)]
*  My frustration in a way is that I want to be able [[00:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3553.06s)]
*  to lead by example when it comes, [[00:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3555.98s)]
*  there's a lot of people with a lot of discretionary money, [[00:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3558.38s)]
*  billionaires who maybe could be doing [[00:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3562.2200000000003s)]
*  really good stuff with that. [[00:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3565.54s)]
*  And I'd like to have the skills to inspire them. [[00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3567.7000000000003s)]
*  I don't have those skills. [[00:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3573.1800000000003s)]
*  Well, I don't even, I mean, I think even here today [[00:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3575.2200000000003s)]
*  the things that you care about are things that sometimes [[00:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3578.1800000000003s)]
*  I don't even think to care about in some ways, [[00:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3580.6600000000003s)]
*  or fears that I don't think that, [[00:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3582.7400000000002s)]
*  you don't even think that, oh, somebody has to, [[00:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3584.86s)]
*  we need to have, a person needs to donate to this [[00:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3587.06s)]
*  because maybe our country isn't worried about it enough yet. [[00:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3590.9s)]
*  So I think it sounds like you're doing a good job. [[00:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3594.42s)]
*  When you, did your company, [[00:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3598.26s)]
*  because I'm trying to think, so guns was a thing, [[01:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3601.38s)]
*  did you guys end up selling them on there or no? [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3603.78s)]
*  No, he said no guns. [[01:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3605.9s)]
*  Swords, anything? [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3608.58s)]
*  I have a feeling swords are okay, [[01:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3611.9s)]
*  but I've never thought about it. [[01:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3613.7400000000002s)]
*  Yeah, I'm trying to think of some, I mean, [[01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3615.26s)]
*  cause he, I mean, yeah. [[01:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3617.7000000000003s)]
*  Drugs are illegal, they're off. [[01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3620.34s)]
*  So drugs were off, but people would try to skirt around that. [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3622.82s)]
*  But even then some of that was sometimes also, [[01:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3625.46s)]
*  now were there ever caught, like, [[01:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3627.5800000000004s)]
*  could the cops use your site as well if they wanted to, [[01:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3630.0200000000004s)]
*  to like as decoy type of stuff? [[01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3632.38s)]
*  I hear gossip about that. [[01:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3637.2200000000003s)]
*  I don't know how true that really is. [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3639.6600000000003s)]
*  Right, cause you don't know, right? [[01:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3641.6600000000003s)]
*  I do know that the cops have used the site [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3642.78s)]
*  in different ways to fight crime. [[01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3646.34s)]
*  Sometimes, let's suppose they think they see [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3648.94s)]
*  a stolen item being listed on the site, [[01:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3652.86s)]
*  then they would, well this is true for anything on the net. [[01:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3657.3s)]
*  If a cop sees something they think is wrong [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3660.5s)]
*  and they have a shot at doing something about it, [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3662.6000000000004s)]
*  they send a subpoena or a search warrant to the site. [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3664.98s)]
*  And then the site, the operators usually pass it [[01:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3669.66s)]
*  to their lawyers, and then the site operators provide [[01:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3673.8199999999997s)]
*  the forensic evidence to the cops, [[01:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3678.58s)]
*  which again is like CSI and just fighting crime there. [[01:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3681.98s)]
*  The deal is in this country, we have these checks [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3686.18s)]
*  and balances in the Constitution and Bill of Rights, [[01:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3689.18s)]
*  and you know, the founders of the country [[01:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3693.22s)]
*  did a really good job of that. [[01:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3695.74s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3697.46s)]
*  There are amendments and so on, [[01:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3698.5s)]
*  which we only thought of years after, [[01:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3700.82s)]
*  but the people who did the initial work did great work, [[01:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3703.6200000000003s)]
*  and it for the most part stands up today. [[01:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3708.98s)]
*  They built a good structure over there. [[01:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3712.82s)]
*  Yeah, well it's funny cause you guys, [[01:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3714.94s)]
*  yeah, it's just like, it's such a part of history, [[01:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3716.5800000000004s)]
*  it's such a, I mean, I went on dates from it. [[01:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3719.3s)]
*  I remember I met a girl, I met a girl on, [[01:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3722.7000000000003s)]
*  I mean, I would use casual encounters too, you know? [[01:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3726.58s)]
*  It's like, that was sometimes, I met a girl one time [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3728.74s)]
*  and we watched a Nets game and made love honestly, [[01:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3733.2599999999998s)]
*  and she let me sign her cast, right? [[01:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3735.7799999999997s)]
*  And I was like, you know, and it was, we had a great time. [[01:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3737.62s)]
*  I think we dated for a little bit. [[01:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3741.8199999999997s)]
*  There's no accounting for taste. [[01:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3744.94s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3746.5s)]
*  But I'm glad, I'm glad you had to be successful. [[01:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3747.34s)]
*  Yeah, I know, who wants to be a Nets fan? [[01:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3750.42s)]
*  Yeah, your guys can remember that one for later years. [[01:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3751.7s)]
*  Oh, they've been on there, dude. [[01:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3755.38s)]
*  I think we accidentally met up once. [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3756.42s)]
*  But there was a place, you know, I was like, [[01:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3759.46s)]
*  I had such a tough time at a certain point in my life [[01:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3761.42s)]
*  dating, there was something that added a level of mystery [[01:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3763.6200000000003s)]
*  about it that I really liked. [[01:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3766.6200000000003s)]
*  I've never thought about that. [[01:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3768.98s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3770.46s)]
*  Everyone works differently. [[01:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3771.34s)]
*  Everyone does have different tastes [[01:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3773.38s)]
*  and that's none of my business. [[01:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3775.78s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3779.58s)]
*  You know, as long as it's legal. [[01:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3780.58s)]
*  Oh yeah, it was legal. [[01:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3783.02s)]
*  It's funny to say that people started marriages. [[01:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3785.9s)]
*  So people even got married off of putting out a dating, [[01:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3788.42s)]
*  like I would like to meet someone. [[01:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3791.9s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3793.58s)]
*  Wow, did you ever get invited to a wedding or anything? [[01:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3794.42s)]
*  I have gotten invited a number of times. [[01:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3795.78s)]
*  I'm not much for ceremonies or galas or anything like that. [[01:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3798.98s)]
*  And my relatives know this very well. [[01:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3804.34s)]
*  I have a dispensation to not go [[01:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3807.2200000000003s)]
*  to some of the more obscure events on my wife's side. [[01:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3810.82s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3813.54s)]
*  And on the record, I'm very grateful. [[01:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3815.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3818.22s)]
*  I think your comedy's getting better. [[01:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3822.98s)]
*  I've promised to, if I'm offered open mic night, [[01:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3825.58s)]
*  I will not do it. [[01:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3828.98s)]
*  Is pornography causing a problem in your life? [[01:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3833.06s)]
*  Do you find yourself watching porno [[01:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3836.54s)]
*  for longer periods of time and having trouble stopping? [[01:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3838.66s)]
*  Is porn affecting your relationship or dating life? [[01:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3843.1s)]
*  Well, you're certainly not alone. [[01:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3847.7s)]
*  Watching pornography has become so commonplace today. [[01:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3850.02s)]
*  And oftentimes men use porn to numb the pain of loneliness, [[01:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3853.46s)]
*  boredom, anxiety, and depression. [[01:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3857.9s)]
*  Shame and stigma prevent men from talking about these issues [[01:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3861.22s)]
*  and getting help for them. [[01:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3864.66s)]

*  When you guys, at what point did you realize, [[01:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3928.0600000000004s)]
*  okay, I need to, had you had enough of the day to day, [[01:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3930.42s)]
*  what made you start to decide I want to sell the company? [[01:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3934.5800000000004s)]
*  I haven't sold the company. [[01:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3938.2200000000003s)]
*  Oh, you haven't sold? [[01:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3939.7000000000003s)]
*  Okay, sorry. [[01:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3940.54s)]
*  Here's the history to prevent some confusion. [[01:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3941.38s)]
*  I gave a guy some equity, I made it a gift [[01:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3944.1800000000003s)]
*  on the expectation that he'd deliver. [[01:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3947.5s)]
*  That may have not happened, but he wanted to sell, [[01:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3950.7000000000003s)]
*  sold to eBay, didn't work out, [[01:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3955.5s)]
*  and we bought that equity back from eBay. [[01:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3958.7s)]
*  Nice. [[01:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3962.94s)]
*  Now what I've done is I had a chunk of equity stock [[01:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3963.78s)]
*  and again thinking I don't need this. [[01:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3968.5s)]
*  So I created a 501C4 foundation, [[01:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3971.26s)]
*  put all the equity in there, [[01:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3976.7s)]
*  and that's what generates dividends and sales. [[01:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3978.38s)]
*  Okay. [[01:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3981.9s)]
*  And that's what I'm using to fund these things. [[01:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3982.74s)]
*  Ah. [[01:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3984.58s)]
*  So I now have a good idea of how much money I have [[01:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3986.34s)]
*  to give away in the rest of my life. [[01:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3989.46s)]
*  Because you can look at the dividends and the earnings. [[01:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3991.7000000000003s)]
*  That's that kind of stuff. [[01:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3995.2200000000003s)]
*  And I figure I've got five to 20 years, [[01:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=3997.1s)]
*  and I know roughly how fast I should do it. [[01:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4001.86s)]
*  And my trouble though is that I'm 72, [[01:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4005.54s)]
*  20 years out I may have to conduct due diligence [[01:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4009.26s)]
*  via a seance. [[01:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4013.14s)]
*  And Ouija boards don't have the bandwidth I need. [[01:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4015.66s)]
*  So I may just come back and haunt people. [[01:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4021.62s)]
*  Yeah, hey, that would be awesome. [[01:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4024.62s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4025.98s)]
*  Oh, I could definitely see a spirit looking [[01:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4026.8199999999997s)]
*  for a place to stay, you know? [[01:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4028.7799999999997s)]
*  You have an excellent point there, [[01:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4030.98s)]
*  although computers don't operate very well [[01:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4033.66s)]
*  in the afterlife. [[01:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4037.14s)]
*  Although I'm making an assumption. [[01:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4038.74s)]
*  I don't know if that's true. [[01:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4040.7s)]
*  So you still own it? [[01:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4043.02s)]
*  Oh, this is an important distinction. [[01:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4045.4199999999996s)]
*  I now own no equity. [[01:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4049.4199999999996s)]
*  It's in that foundation, 501C4. [[01:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4051.7799999999997s)]
*  Okay, so the company was transferred into a foundation [[01:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4055.2999999999997s)]
*  or sold to a foundation. [[01:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4057.46s)]
*  My parts of it. [[01:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4058.54s)]
*  Other people do own chunks of the company. [[01:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4059.8199999999997s)]
*  Got it. [[01:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4061.98s)]
*  And they do what's right for them. [[01:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4062.8199999999997s)]
*  Okay. [[01:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4064.54s)]
*  Me, what's right for me is frankly [[01:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4065.3799999999997s)]
*  to keep a little for myself. [[01:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4067.54s)]
*  Okay. [[01:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4069.5s)]
*  Because the wife insists that she needs to buy socks. [[01:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4070.7s)]
*  Yeah, oh yeah. [[01:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4074.54s)]
*  And so we have some leftover, [[01:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4075.3799999999997s)]
*  which we do share with family. [[01:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4078.66s)]
*  But the vast bulk of it is now for charity. [[01:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4082.66s)]
*  I mean, just yesterday, a guy, I guess an economist, [[01:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4087.5s)]
*  analyzed what I would have made [[01:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4091.02s)]
*  had I done the usual Silicon Valley thing. [[01:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4093.7s)]
*  He said now I'd be worth 11 billion. [[01:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4096.38s)]
*  If you had saved the company and just sold it. [[01:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4099.38s)]
*  Well, if I did the usual. [[01:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4101.5s)]
*  And maybe he's right. [[01:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4103.22s)]
*  I don't understand the analysis. [[01:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4105.3s)]
*  But I don't know what I would do with that. [[01:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4107.62s)]
*  11 billion dollars? [[01:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4110.14s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4111.54s)]
*  Yeah, what would you even do it? [[01:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4112.38s)]
*  How many, yeah, [[01:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4113.22s)]
*  because how much money can you put in your bank? [[01:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4114.3s)]
*  Well, I don't think about it. [[01:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4117.38s)]
*  There are some luxuries I like, [[01:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4120.1s)]
*  but I don't own a car. [[01:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4122.22s)]
*  Really? [[01:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4124.26s)]
*  Frankly, between the subway and Uber, cabs or Lyft, [[01:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4125.14s)]
*  that's what I need. [[01:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4130.700000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4131.900000000001s)]
*  And again, this is not altruistic or anything like that. [[01:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4132.740000000001s)]
*  This is just being sensible. [[01:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4136.22s)]
*  And altruistic, just so our listeners know. [[01:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4139.34s)]
*  Altruistic means that you sometimes value [[01:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4141.58s)]
*  helping other people more than yourself. [[01:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4144.780000000001s)]
*  Okay. [[01:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4147.9400000000005s)]
*  It's the Bible thing. [[01:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4148.780000000001s)]
*  Right. [[01:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4150.14s)]
*  And I agree. [[01:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4150.9800000000005s)]
*  I just, my variation of have enough to be comfortable [[01:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4152.82s)]
*  and to indulge your family, maybe friends sometimes, [[01:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4159.34s)]
*  and then better do give stuff away. [[01:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4163.74s)]
*  It's a difficult balance [[01:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4166.94s)]
*  because the future is unpredictable. [[01:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4168.66s)]
*  And I guess it's gotten more unpredictable. [[01:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4170.98s)]
*  But there are people who need a lot of where I can help [[01:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4173.5s)]
*  without digging into my personal stuff. [[01:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4177.98s)]
*  Yeah, understood. [[01:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4181.0199999999995s)]
*  Yeah, I just wanted to know, [[01:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4182.02s)]
*  because yeah, sometimes I forget [[01:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4183.02s)]
*  and sometimes maybe some of our listeners forget. [[01:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4184.18s)]
*  Did you ever feel like other tech companies, [[01:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4186.18s)]
*  even though they were probably, I bet, [[01:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4190.42s)]
*  secretly jealous looked down at Craigslist [[01:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4191.780000000001s)]
*  because it was this, like, what was that like? [[01:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4194.14s)]
*  I just wondered. [[01:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4197.02s)]
*  They're quite explicit. [[01:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4199.860000000001s)]
*  They don't, it's not a secret. [[01:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4200.860000000001s)]
*  They don't like this model we have [[01:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4202.5s)]
*  of doing well by doing good. [[01:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4205.540000000001s)]
*  Sometimes, let's say they're not respectful of it, [[01:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4208.179999999999s)]
*  and that's okay. [[01:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4213.179999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4214.42s)]
*  The thing is, I remember what I learned in Sunday school [[01:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4215.259999999999s)]
*  and people often forget. [[01:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4218.98s)]
*  And again, not pious of me or anything like that. [[01:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4221.62s)]
*  No, I think it's fair to stand up [[01:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4224.38s)]
*  for also what you were aiming for. [[01:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4225.82s)]
*  Well, I've met a bunch of rich people. [[01:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4228.0599999999995s)]
*  None of them are all that happy. [[01:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4230.94s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4234.54s)]
*  And yeah, having too much money is a big trap. [[01:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4235.38s)]
*  And you get surrounded by people, by yes men, [[01:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4242.38s)]
*  and you get insulated from the needs of regular people. [[01:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4246.46s)]
*  And that does some real damage. [[01:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4253.22s)]
*  How do you keep yourself balanced from that? [[01:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4256.26s)]
*  Yeah, because it's interesting, [[01:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4258.22s)]
*  because you seem like someone who would have a fair answer [[01:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4260.22s)]
*  to what are some of the side effects, [[01:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4262.06s)]
*  the negative side effects of? [[01:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4264.34s)]
*  Well, the deal is that it... [[01:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4266.66s)]
*  Of money, of having some money, [[01:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4269.62s)]
*  or coming into some money. [[01:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4271.1s)]
*  Yeah, the deal is to be a little bit as cheap [[01:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4272.34s)]
*  as I was when I grew up in the 50s, [[01:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4276.78s)]
*  and to do things for yourself or by yourself, [[01:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4280.14s)]
*  like especially going across town, [[01:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4284.7s)]
*  I don't need to take a car. [[01:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4287.42s)]
*  The subway is usually better. [[01:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4289.74s)]
*  And so I do that. [[01:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4291.860000000001s)]
*  Although I did get here on a limo [[01:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4293.74s)]
*  because someone else paid for it. [[01:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4295.74s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4297.22s)]
*  And they really wanted to. [[01:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4298.139999999999s)]
*  Good. [[01:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4300.22s)]
*  So the deal is that, and I, [[01:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4301.54s)]
*  now and then I will go to a fancy dinner. [[01:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4304.139999999999s)]
*  Oh yeah, that's nice. [[01:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4307.0599999999995s)]
*  You have to treat yourself to good food. [[01:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4307.98s)]
*  The thing is that you could find good food a lot [[01:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4309.98s)]
*  more cheaply and with a little bit more fun. [[01:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4313.74s)]
*  And so a lot of those things I just don't get [[01:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4317.42s)]
*  and I wouldn't mind having a smaller house, [[01:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4323.9s)]
*  but the wife's side of the family is very, very large. [[01:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4328.98s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4333.38s)]
*  I have a one nephew and one niece. [[01:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4334.22s)]
*  The nephew just got married and I had to attend that one. [[01:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4337.42s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4340.7s)]
*  However, on my wife's side we have 20 nephew and nieces. [[01:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4341.98s)]
*  Oh, that's too many. [[01:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4347.66s)]
*  Well, it mostly means that I've learned [[01:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4349.22s)]
*  to control my language. [[01:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4350.94s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4352.3s)]
*  Because I don't want to, [[01:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4353.14s)]
*  I don't want to catch shit from any of my relatives. [[01:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4355.46s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4357.860000000001s)]
*  And it works out pretty well. [[01:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4358.700000000001s)]
*  Typically I know as they say that when the kid is allowed [[01:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4361.740000000001s)]
*  to watch HBO, I'm allowed to use saltier languages. [[01:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4366.26s)]
*  Oh yeah, I hate that buddy. [[01:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4370.38s)]
*  Yeah, only salt in our languages. [[01:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4372.58s)]
*  Yeah, I was just wondering, [[01:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4376.5s)]
*  what was, was there one thing, [[01:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4377.9400000000005s)]
*  like it was whether it was something like a specific [[01:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4379.7s)]
*  Leonard Cohen piece, a record that he made [[01:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4385.099999999999s)]
*  that he'd autographed, [[01:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4387.74s)]
*  was there one nice thing you bought for yourself [[01:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4388.58s)]
*  that was something that was meaningful to you? [[01:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4390.5s)]
*  I bought some of the prints that he made. [[01:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4393.78s)]
*  Oh, you did, okay. [[01:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4396.42s)]
*  See, he's an artist for real. [[01:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4397.26s)]
*  The thing which I regret is that around here [[01:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4399.66s)]
*  there was an auction of a lot of his letters and stuff [[01:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4402.38s)]
*  and I should have overindulged myself. [[01:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4406.58s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4410.54s)]
*  But it was the first auction [[01:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4411.9s)]
*  I actually seriously participated in [[01:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4413.5s)]
*  and I just didn't get anything. [[01:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4416.42s)]
*  Yeah, man. [[01:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4419.9s)]
*  I don't recognize it. [[01:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4420.9s)]
*  I didn't have anything in color. [[01:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4421.86s)]
*  I did as a black and white prints [[01:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4423.86s)]
*  and you're heading into some of the ones that just passed. [[01:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4426.18s)]
*  The ones in the middle right now, [[01:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4429.1s)]
*  two of them I think I have. [[01:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4431.1s)]
*  Wow, that's cool. [[01:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4433.1s)]
*  Yeah, especially the one that's exactly what I have. [[01:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4434.98s)]
*  Really? [[01:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4437.98s)]
*  Yeah, and I may have that one on a t-shirt. [[01:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4438.98s)]
*  Wow. [[01:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4441.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4442.94s)]
*  Yeah, something like that's nice, man. [[01:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4443.78s)]
*  Especially if it's art or something like that. [[01:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4445.099999999999s)]
*  It's like, if I could go back in time, [[01:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4446.9s)]
*  there was like a time, one time I was in Tanzania [[01:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4449.419999999999s)]
*  and I was doing Mount Kilimanjaro, right? [[01:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4455.299999999999s)]
*  And afterwards we went someplace [[01:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4459.099999999999s)]
*  and they had a piece of art in there [[01:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4461.58s)]
*  and it was like $500, right? [[01:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4463.22s)]
*  And I could spend like maybe $300, [[01:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4465.66s)]
*  but I wished I'd have spent, [[01:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4468.06s)]
*  because going like, it was 15 years ago [[01:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4469.58s)]
*  and it's like the $200 wouldn't have changed my life [[01:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4472.3s)]
*  that much, it was a lot of money at the time, [[01:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4475.34s)]
*  but it's like, I didn't even think about it [[01:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4477.46s)]
*  two weeks later or two months later. [[01:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4479.46s)]
*  So I just wished that I would have got, [[01:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4481.9400000000005s)]
*  because I really liked the painting. [[01:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4483.34s)]
*  I was like, God, I just, and sometimes I wish, [[01:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4485.26s)]
*  like every now and then there's little things like that, [[01:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4488.22s)]
*  I wish I'd have gotten like a nice piece of art [[01:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4490.22s)]
*  or something, you know? [[01:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4492.1s)]
*  Yeah, and the, let's see, on my side of the house, [[01:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4493.18s)]
*  that's the biggest investment I've made in art. [[01:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4498.02s)]
*  My wife was an art major, so she knows this stuff [[01:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4501.740000000001s)]
*  and a lot of it these days is cheap at auction [[01:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4504.740000000001s)]
*  and she's good at that. [[01:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4507.820000000001s)]
*  Yeah, she's gotten good at a number of things, [[01:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4509.700000000001s)]
*  including free upgrades while flying. [[01:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4511.5s)]
*  Oh yeah, it's a deal. [[01:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4514.620000000001s)]
*  That's her new hobby and she's good at it. [[01:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4515.58s)]
*  I'm trying to think of something else. [[01:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4518.700000000001s)]
*  Were there other, so Craigslist was kind of the stepchild [[01:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4521.700000000001s)]
*  of the tech industry in a weird way. [[01:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4527.700000000001s)]
*  Was it looked at like that? [[01:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4529.42s)]
*  Because I could imagine how jealous, [[01:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4530.9800000000005s)]
*  because here's people putting billions and millions [[01:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4532.54s)]
*  of dollars into building this thing, this new avenue [[01:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4535.14s)]
*  and all these venture capitalists and stuff like that [[01:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4538.3s)]
*  and then they, all this advertising, [[01:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4540.900000000001s)]
*  and here you are with this basic kind of peer-to-peer [[01:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4543.3s)]
*  how can I offer something that could potentially [[01:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4546.74s)]
*  help my neighbor or connect to neighbors [[01:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4548.54s)]
*  that could use something? [[01:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4550.66s)]
*  Yeah, we've always been an outlier. [[01:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4552.18s)]
*  As one person put it, we're one of the few [[01:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4554.26s)]
*  ungentrified sites on the net. [[01:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4556.58s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4560.06s)]
*  And I guess we like it that way. [[01:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4560.9s)]
*  Nothing has, not everything has to be expensive or fancy. [[01:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4564.06s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4569.06s)]
*  To give credit to a site I consider ungentrified, [[01:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4569.9s)]
*  that's WikiPeaks, [[01:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4573.26s)]
*  ungentrified, that's Wikipedia. [[01:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4574.78s)]
*  Wikipedia is where facts go to live. [[01:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4577.62s)]
*  And in the long run, Wikipedia I think is the most important [[01:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4580.5s)]
*  of all sites. [[01:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4585.5s)]
*  I work with them and even in New York, [[01:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4586.94s)]
*  I'm working with their local chapter [[01:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4590.139999999999s)]
*  to give classes Wikipedia for beginners. [[01:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4592.9s)]
*  Really? [[01:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4596.62s)]
*  Well, when you get to write an article or change an article, [[01:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4597.46s)]
*  that gives you a lot of power. [[01:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4601.42s)]
*  Well, in a small way to determine how people think of things [[01:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4604.14s)]
*  you get to write history. [[01:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4610.34s)]
*  Oh, and some of it's not true. [[01:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4611.860000000001s)]
*  Like there's stuff on my Wikipedia [[01:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4613.1s)]
*  like attaching me to like a part of my family, [[01:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4614.620000000001s)]
*  like they have half my family members wrong on it and stuff [[01:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4617.22s)]
*  and it like puts me in it. [[01:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4622.38s)]
*  It's crazy. [[01:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4623.34s)]
*  I'm like, all right. [[01:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4624.18s)]
*  The deal, unlike newspapers, [[01:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4625.02s)]
*  well, they don't correct themselves normally, [[01:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4628.02s)]
*  especially not in a big way. [[01:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4630.02s)]
*  But in Wikipedia, you can do that. [[01:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4631.78s)]
*  And basically you can get a good citation, [[01:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4634.94s)]
*  some evidence of what's right and wrong [[01:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4640.259999999999s)]
*  and then send it to someone who knows how to edit it. [[01:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4642.82s)]
*  And they can do it. [[01:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4646.54s)]
*  They can do that. [[01:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4647.38s)]
*  Oh, dang. [[01:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4648.219999999999s)]
*  And you guys know how to get hold of me. [[01:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4649.0599999999995s)]
*  And then I know I can get hold of someone [[01:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4653.9s)]
*  who knows how to do the edits. [[01:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4657.219999999999s)]
*  At least how to do it. [[01:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4659.58s)]
*  I've not gone to the class yet. [[01:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4660.42s)]
*  Okay. [[01:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4662.46s)]
*  And yeah, the deal is that the system isn't perfect, [[01:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4663.3s)]
*  but it's better than anything anyone else has tried. [[01:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4667.86s)]
*  Yeah, it's true. [[01:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4670.86s)]
*  And things do get fixed. [[01:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4671.7s)]
*  It may not happen as fast as anyone wants. [[01:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4674.14s)]
*  But again, there's things, [[01:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4678.22s)]
*  let's say in the newspaper of record, [[01:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4680.9800000000005s)]
*  things which I know are wrong [[01:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4684.62s)]
*  which have been presented to them [[01:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4687.54s)]
*  and they're just not gonna fix it. [[01:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4689.62s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4691.0199999999995s)]
*  And they don't want to? [[01:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4691.98s)]
*  I don't understand the reasoning. [[01:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4694.7s)]
*  You don't wanna shape history sometimes you think? [[01:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4695.54s)]
*  Well, the deal is they were brought [[01:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4697.38s)]
*  something which was wrong. [[01:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4702.7s)]
*  It was proven to be wrong. [[01:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4704.62s)]
*  And they say they weren't gonna be truth vigilantes. [[01:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4706.54s)]
*  And I guess I disagree. [[01:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4711.0599999999995s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4714.38s)]
*  Yeah, that's interesting. [[01:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4715.34s)]
*  Well, that's a big thing about information now. [[01:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4716.54s)]
*  It's like, it's something I worry about with AI [[01:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4718.5s)]
*  because if there's, [[01:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4720.58s)]
*  and even just the history of the web, [[01:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4723.42s)]
*  like things in the history of the web [[01:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4725.18s)]
*  because people can alter that over time. [[01:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4726.7s)]
*  There's big problems with that now. [[01:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4729.78s)]
*  A number of AI systems are feeding [[01:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4733.1s)]
*  on the output of other AI systems, [[01:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4735.62s)]
*  which could be hallucinating, [[01:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4738.26s)]
*  or it could be if you train. Compromised. [[01:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4740.58s)]
*  Yeah, well, that's one way to do that. [[01:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4743.34s)]
*  And I like the idea of really good AI [[01:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4745.78s)]
*  replacing or supplementing search. [[01:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4751.139999999999s)]
*  But I worry about that also [[01:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4754.42s)]
*  because even if I just casually screw around, [[01:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4758.7s)]
*  I can get the AI systems to produce wrong information. [[01:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4762.46s)]
*  And I talk about it with some of the people [[01:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4767.98s)]
*  at these companies and hope that they get it right. [[01:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4771.14s)]
*  I do have a lot of hope for AI doing customer service [[01:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4776.5s)]
*  because if it's done with commitment, [[01:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4780.3s)]
*  if it's done right, it can be done much better [[01:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4782.740000000001s)]
*  because sometimes, like you call up for a customer service, [[01:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4787.22s)]
*  you get a call center someplace [[01:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4791.860000000001s)]
*  where they just don't know how to do it. [[01:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4793.9400000000005s)]
*  They don't know. [[01:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4796.1s)]
*  And I try to be kind to people [[01:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4796.9400000000005s)]
*  who have been effectively sabotaged by their management. [[01:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4800.22s)]
*  Sometimes I become less impatient than I should be. [[01:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4804.66s)]
*  Oh yeah, oh you'll call up customer service [[01:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4810.46s)]
*  and they're like, we don't even know [[01:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4812.5s)]
*  what you're talking about, but they still answer the phone. [[01:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4813.740000000001s)]
*  I'm like, who are you? [[01:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4815.780000000001s)]
*  Yeah, and instead of complaining about that, [[01:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4817.54s)]
*  I'm trying to talk about it, [[01:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4821.7s)]
*  and I am putting my money where my mouth is, [[01:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4824.1s)]
*  like for consumer reports, [[01:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4826.780000000001s)]
*  which I'm involved with and working with a lot. [[01:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4828.86s)]
*  With the magazine website? [[01:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4831.0199999999995s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4832.139999999999s)]
*  Okay. [[01:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4832.98s)]
*  Because they're trustworthy, [[01:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4833.799999999999s)]
*  and the idea is that, yeah, [[01:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4835.259999999999s)]
*  I would enjoy working with an AI system [[01:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4838.98s)]
*  which would be responsive and give me good information. [[01:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4842.42s)]
*  And even if it can't, maybe it would kick it to a person [[01:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4847.42s)]
*  who might have to do research, [[01:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4851.36s)]
*  but at least they would be good at it. [[01:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4853.0199999999995s)]
*  Oh, understood. [[01:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4854.94s)]
*  Yeah, I actually have a question about that, [[01:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4856.58s)]
*  but I want to remember to ask this, [[01:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4858.82s)]
*  how did Craigslist make money? [[01:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4860.22s)]
*  Oh, oddly enough, since we run very lean, [[01:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4862.26s)]
*  Jim runs us very lean, [[01:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4866.22s)]
*  and even though we minimally charge, [[01:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4868.34s)]
*  that makes enough because we're not expected [[01:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4870.9400000000005s)]
*  to produce great results for VCs. [[01:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4876.1s)]
*  For venture capitalists. [[01:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4879.900000000001s)]
*  Yes. [[01:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4880.900000000001s)]
*  So you don't have these money guys, [[01:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4881.74s)]
*  like I need my return. [[01:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4883.02s)]
*  Right. [[01:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4884.58s)]
*  Yeah, if no one's invested millions in us, [[01:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4885.42s)]
*  we don't have to go public, [[01:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4888.88s)]
*  no one's looking to get billions, [[01:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4889.72s)]
*  and I'm happy with the current results. [[01:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4893.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4897.92s)]
*  The future is scary sometimes, [[01:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4898.76s)]
*  but this works out pretty well. [[01:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4901.8s)]
*  You've also talked a lot about, yeah, that's your water. [[01:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4904.2s)]
*  Yeah, thank you. [[01:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4906.44s)]
*  I have just like one or two more questions. [[01:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4907.86s)]
*  Sure. [[01:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4909.64s)]
*  Maybe you can get that or I can get it for you. [[01:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4913.88s)]
*  I'm stubborn. [[01:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4916.5199999999995s)]
*  I am stubborn. [[01:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4918.360000000001s)]
*  Oh my God, dude, you're crazy, Craig, [[01:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4922.2s)]
*  because I've never heard somebody, [[01:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4923.88s)]
*  imagine I'm trying to open a water, right? [[01:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4928.320000000001s)]
*  I can't open it. [[01:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4930.54s)]
*  And then I say, I'm stubborn. [[01:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4934.280000000001s)]
*  Like I'm stubborn. [[01:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4936.64s)]
*  It didn't even make sense. [[01:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4940.12s)]
*  To me, that was very funny. [[01:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4942.240000000001s)]
*  Well, you're like, I can't open it. [[01:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4945.16s)]
*  And I was like, I don't know if you could open it out. [[01:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4946.32s)]
*  I was just trying to, I don't know, [[01:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4948.599999999999s)]
*  but I was like, oh, can I help you? [[01:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4950.32s)]
*  And then you're like, I'm stubborn. [[01:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4951.92s)]
*  But to me, in my head, I was like, he can't open it, [[01:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4953.759999999999s)]
*  but he just, the bottle's stubborn. [[01:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4956.5599999999995s)]
*  Anyway, this didn't make any sense. [[01:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4960.48s)]
*  My deal is that as an old man, [[01:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4961.92s)]
*  I'm happy when I can still do some things. [[01:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4964.16s)]
*  Oh, I see what you're saying. [[01:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4966.92s)]
*  You've talked a lot about independent journalism, right? [[01:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4969.5199999999995s)]
*  Okay. [[01:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4972.16s)]
*  And that's something that I've read anyway [[01:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4973.0s)]
*  is near and dear to your outlook in the world. [[01:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4974.6s)]
*  Okay. [[01:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4979.72s)]
*  Well, what we learned in US history [[01:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4980.6s)]
*  in this high school class is that [[01:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4983.76s)]
*  a free and trustworthy press is just required [[01:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4986.900000000001s)]
*  to keep a republic alive. [[01:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4990.4400000000005s)]
*  And the whole media system is fractured [[01:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4992.88s)]
*  in all sorts of unpredictable ways. [[01:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4996.6s)]
*  You're part of that. [[01:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=4998.9400000000005s)]
*  I'm a lesser part of it. [[01:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=5000.08s)]
*  And I don't know what to do now [[01:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=5002.08s)]
*  except that I try to support things that I know work, [[01:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=5005.28s)]
*  like the journalism school at the City University [[01:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=5007.879999999999s)]
*  of New York. [[01:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=5011.48s)]
*  Okay. [[01:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=5012.32s)]
*  And Wikipedia is now modern journalism. [[01:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=5013.139999999999s)]
*  There are other things that I try to help, [[01:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=5016.28s)]
*  but I'm confused and I'm kind of paralyzed [[01:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=5018.879999999999s)]
*  around a lot of this. [[01:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=5023.44s)]
*  So I did a lot in the past, [[01:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=5024.719999999999s)]
*  but these days I just try to focus in those areas [[01:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=5026.799999999999s)]
*  where I can help Americans defend the country [[01:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=5030.44s)]
*  because that's a well-defined good, [[01:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=5034.44s)]
*  which we need in a big way right now. [[01:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=5038.04s)]
*  Service members, active or veteran, [[01:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=5043.719999999999s)]
*  and their families have given up a lot for us, [[01:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=5046.36s)]
*  and we don't treat them right, [[01:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=5049.24s)]
*  so I can do something about that. [[01:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=5050.48s)]
*  Cyber warfare is a thing, [[01:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=5053.24s)]
*  and it needs help because the government can do some stuff, [[01:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=5055.799999999999s)]
*  but everyone needs to play a role. [[01:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=5059.36s)]
*  Like in World War II, [[01:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=5061.839999999999s)]
*  everyone needs to harden their systems a little bit [[01:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=5063.36s)]
*  depending on how much of a target you are. [[01:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=5067.44s)]
*  Yeah, it's funny. [[01:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=5070.88s)]
*  I didn't realize until you said some of those things, [[01:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=5071.719999999999s)]
*  like what if suddenly all of our cars were compromised [[01:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=5073.04s)]
*  or half of them or all of our ovens were compromised [[01:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=5077.08s)]
*  to the point where they started fires [[01:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=5079.32s)]
*  in all of our homes? [[01:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=5080.5199999999995s)]
*  I'm just kind of fascinating today. [[01:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=5083.599999999999s)]
*  Well, it means also I've read too much science fiction [[01:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=5085.88s)]
*  in my time, but if 1% of those systems were compromised, [[01:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=5088.44s)]
*  that alone is a big problem. [[01:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=5096.08s)]
*  Yeah, and we don't even realize it. [[01:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=5097.759999999999s)]
*  Were there other businesses [[01:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=5100.36s)]
*  that you tried to start before or after? [[01:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=5102.16s)]
*  No, I am not a real businessman. [[01:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=5105.24s)]
*  It's been a happy accident. [[01:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=5108.08s)]
*  I'm like any success I've had has been by accidentally [[01:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=5110.24s)]
*  being in the right time at the right place, [[01:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=5114.96s)]
*  and that makes me the farrest gump of the internet. [[01:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=5118.72s)]
*  But also with the right attitude [[01:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=5121.12s)]
*  to bring one person to another, [[01:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=5123.8s)]
*  try to keep the golden rule in your mind, [[01:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=5126.5599999999995s)]
*  things you learned from Sunday school. [[01:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=5128.44s)]
*  What about, are your parents pretty proud [[01:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=5131.92s)]
*  of your parents still alive, Greg? [[01:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=5134.28s)]
*  They passed long ago. [[01:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=5136.96s)]
*  Oh, they did. [[01:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=5138.2s)]
*  I'm sure they would be. [[01:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=5139.04s)]
*  I know that my high school history teacher [[01:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=5141.5599999999995s)]
*  learned about his contributions to all my stuff. [[01:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=5146.24s)]
*  He heard about it while he was still around, [[01:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=5149.76s)]
*  and that was a big deal. [[01:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=5153.92s)]
*  Oh, that probably meant a lot, huh? [[01:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=5155.0s)]
*  Yeah, and well, because teachers work hard for little pay. [[01:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=5156.16s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[01:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=5159.76s)]
*  So anytime they have any long-term effect is a big deal. [[01:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=5160.599999999999s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, it's so funny. [[01:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=5165.92s)]
*  I still keep in touch with a lot of my teachers. [[01:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=5167.5199999999995s)]
*  It's important to me. [[01:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=5171.08s)]
*  I should, but at my age, there may not be many left. [[01:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=5172.16s)]
*  Well, that's why we gotta get that Ouija board going. [[01:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=5175.72s)]
*  Yes. [[01:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=5179.84s)]
*  I think that's the next level. [[01:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=5180.68s)]
*  What are some small, before you leave, Greg, [[01:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=5182.88s)]
*  what are some goals in your life like right now? [[01:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=5184.72s)]
*  I know you've talked about some of the work-oriented [[01:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=5186.56s)]
*  and giving back. [[01:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=5189.080000000001s)]
*  Are there any kind of personal goals, [[01:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=5190.52s)]
*  or are there anything like, I don't know, [[01:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=5191.88s)]
*  is there any kind of goals you have, [[01:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=5195.280000000001s)]
*  even if they're just human to yourself, [[01:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=5196.56s)]
*  things you still wanna learn or do? [[01:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=5199.400000000001s)]
*  Professionally, I want cybersecurity [[01:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=5201.080000000001s)]
*  to be a household word that everyone takes seriously. [[01:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=5204.96s)]
*  Personally, I'll be glad if the dentist tomorrow [[01:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=5209.68s)]
*  uses nitrous oxide. [[01:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=5213.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=5215.36s)]
*  And I will make the same joke over again, [[01:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=5216.88s)]
*  that is, can I take the bottle home? [[01:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=5219.96s)]
*  And he will refuse me. [[01:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=5222.36s)]
*  Oh. [[01:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=5224.24s)]
*  But we like to do that. [[01:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=5225.88s)]
*  No, we do like to do that. [[01:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=5226.96s)]
*  I think that's good, guys, pretty good. [[01:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=5229.2s)]
*  Is there anything else that you wanna share [[01:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=5231.28s)]
*  that's important to you? [[01:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=5232.4800000000005s)]
*  I think you got it all, and I think people will be tired [[01:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=5234.12s)]
*  of hearing from me after 90 minutes. [[01:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=5236.5599999999995s)]
*  Well, look, I do know if you really wanna get [[01:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=5239.5199999999995s)]
*  some nitrous oxide, you might be able to find some [[01:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=5242.12s)]
*  on Craig's list. [[01:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=5244.4s)]
*  I've been advised by my medical team against it. [[01:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=5246.88s)]
*  All I can remember, well, for sure, [[01:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=5250.36s)]
*  is like the Batman says, I'm not the nerd you want, [[01:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTj69Gv3ZaU&t=5253.16s)]
