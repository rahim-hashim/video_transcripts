*  I was very focused on things. Oh [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWpWvCpQ-hM&t=268.82s)]
*  I think I probably was asked burger or something. No one tested you back then [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWpWvCpQ-hM&t=272.09999999999997s)]

*  Everything everything is like she's defusing a bomb like you have to put the thing in that like that everything. Oh, so I have a very [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWpWvCpQ-hM&t=301.94s)]
*  Solid trigger to being late, which I'm sorry. I'm late [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWpWvCpQ-hM&t=309.3s)]
*  I don't like being late and I was very anxious the whole ride over I sped I sped past a cop [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWpWvCpQ-hM&t=311.46000000000004s)]

*  It was his I shouldn't even say never mind [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWpWvCpQ-hM&t=343.02s)]
*  They like so very illegal and they just let him go they're just like I can't even right the black and white thing is so [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWpWvCpQ-hM&t=347.7s)]

*  But also you these guys cops just defend cops for five minutes. Oh totally they [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWpWvCpQ-hM&t=374.62s)]
*  Imagine a job where you go where people are being assholes all day [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWpWvCpQ-hM&t=380.70000000000005s)]
*  Like they're being assholes over here and you go there and they're there they yell at you and they spit on you [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWpWvCpQ-hM&t=384.18s)]

*  Why did you just take the magazine down and go somewhere else? [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWpWvCpQ-hM&t=718.62s)]
*  I mean, that's uh, that was a question because it was in my brother's closet [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWpWvCpQ-hM&t=720.82s)]

*  Shelving unit but like the poor kids had him it was the style of poor people had I can't so when you're in like a marshals [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWpWvCpQ-hM&t=745.46s)]

*  But I remember ejaculating up there for the first time [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWpWvCpQ-hM&t=760.02s)]
*  Yeah [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWpWvCpQ-hM&t=763.26s)]
*  You never forget that. Oh, I was I couldn't believe it. I was like where where it is a moment [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWpWvCpQ-hM&t=765.02s)]
*  You're you don't even know what happened [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWpWvCpQ-hM&t=772.42s)]
*  You think you're gonna die you don't know what's gonna happen you don't know if you're about to win something [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWpWvCpQ-hM&t=777.46s)]
*  Yeah, and it's coming from like I mean it's your like genetic like it's like the dinosaur in yeah [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWpWvCpQ-hM&t=783.18s)]
*  No, it's like that dirty reptile. It's like he is something billion year old [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWpWvCpQ-hM&t=791.26s)]
*  I mean you see it's in all of us all animals and also with the breastfeeding [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWpWvCpQ-hM&t=795.4s)]
*  So this monkey they reunite with its mom, you know after whatever and it just knew to find her nipple [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWpWvCpQ-hM&t=801.1800000000001s)]
*  And it's just all genetically coded in us. That's why I think we're very much much more machines than we think [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWpWvCpQ-hM&t=807.46s)]
*  the free will [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWpWvCpQ-hM&t=814.82s)]
*  And that's who we are a lot of it we're on a [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWpWvCpQ-hM&t=817.82s)]
*  Some sort of code don't you feel like we're sort of your behaviors a lot of it like that [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWpWvCpQ-hM&t=821.46s)]
*  Exactly, it's coded in and I think there's a lot more stuff we don't think about [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWpWvCpQ-hM&t=826.5400000000001s)]
*  So do you think we have a lot of free will no, I don't I actually Sam Harris has a book about it [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWpWvCpQ-hM&t=829.9s)]
*  And he totally right. He does not believe there is hey and I it freaks you out [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWpWvCpQ-hM&t=835.1s)]
*  Here's why I also think you need to put a lot of weight into what he's saying is because you don't want to believe it [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWpWvCpQ-hM&t=838.5s)]
*  It's like heaven a lot of people believe in heaven. Yeah, cuz you want to believe it [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWpWvCpQ-hM&t=843.34s)]
*  When there's so much evidence there isn't heaven. Well, I wouldn't say that well, what about this? Okay, the idea highway to it [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWpWvCpQ-hM&t=847.66s)]
*  There oh nice. That was a great movie [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWpWvCpQ-hM&t=855.3s)]
*  Dude it was [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWpWvCpQ-hM&t=858.0600000000001s)]
*  That's it was great. But but listen if you got let's see you get amnesia [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWpWvCpQ-hM&t=860.5s)]
*  Okay, okay, I get a little blood gets taken away from your brain for a bit [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWpWvCpQ-hM&t=863.5400000000001s)]
*  I believe it and now you can't remember your family or who you are [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWpWvCpQ-hM&t=866.86s)]
*  Are you telling me you take all the blood out of your brain and you're dead. You suddenly remember everybody [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWpWvCpQ-hM&t=869.7800000000001s)]
*  What is that and they go? Oh, that's the soul. What was yours? You don't have a soul when you're alive [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWpWvCpQ-hM&t=874.98s)]
*  Wait, so what happens I don't have any blood. Yeah, you have like if you're dead, you have no blood. Okay [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWpWvCpQ-hM&t=879.12s)]
*  I mean nothing's running through your brain, right? [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWpWvCpQ-hM&t=883.98s)]
*  And you have amnesia you didn't remember anything. How do you now remember everybody and yourself? How is that possible? [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWpWvCpQ-hM&t=886.58s)]
*  Once you're dead you mean when you go to heaven you remember your family. Yeah, and you're like, yeah, you don't exactly [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWpWvCpQ-hM&t=891.66s)]
*  But most people believe in heaven because they want to believe it which is getting back to free will most people [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWpWvCpQ-hM&t=896.9s)]
*  Including myself and I had to put the book down because it's disturbing [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWpWvCpQ-hM&t=901.9s)]
*  Because he puts a very good case together about how we don't have free will and it's a white guy [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWpWvCpQ-hM&t=905.5s)]
*  It is a white guy, unfortunately [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWpWvCpQ-hM&t=911.26s)]
*  It's a white guy. No, I still believe I look I believe honestly mostly white guys if I'm real honest with myself [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWpWvCpQ-hM&t=913.98s)]
*  Yeah, and like I mean I believe other people as well, but I when I think about people that I believe like [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWpWvCpQ-hM&t=919.38s)]
*  About a lot of stuff a lot of more white. I believe like a cat [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWpWvCpQ-hM&t=926.64s)]
*  casual guy I [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWpWvCpQ-hM&t=930.98s)]
*  Just go by tells, you know touching the face if someone touches their face when they talk to you [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWpWvCpQ-hM&t=932.98s)]
*  Yeah, especially on like a moment. That's important [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWpWvCpQ-hM&t=937.98s)]
*  Pointed question and they go no I didn't do that. They lie. That's a lie. Oh biggest tells the touch face [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWpWvCpQ-hM&t=940.5799999999999s)]
*  Is it really? Mm-hmm. Part of it's actually [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWpWvCpQ-hM&t=946.8199999999999s)]
*  Biological like you actually get blood taken away from your face when you lie if you look guilt or whatever [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWpWvCpQ-hM&t=950.4599999999999s)]
*  So it becomes a little itchy and you kind of want to know [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWpWvCpQ-hM&t=954.98s)]
*  But it's also just like you're trying to cover your mouth a little bit right trying to hide the truth [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWpWvCpQ-hM&t=958.0999999999999s)]
*  You believe you're an honest person. So you're just like it's like a cognitive dissonance. You're just you have a good brain flash [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWpWvCpQ-hM&t=961.98s)]
*  Also, there's microaggressions. Yeah, someone will make a quick expression if you catch it [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWpWvCpQ-hM&t=969.94s)]
*  Say and that's all in Sam Harris book. No, this is other stuff. Oh, but so you so going back to free will yes [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWpWvCpQ-hM&t=974.7800000000001s)]
*  Sometimes I wonder if and now we're so getting programmed by stuff. It's like that our free will whatever little we have [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWpWvCpQ-hM&t=981.98s)]
*  It's almost like [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWpWvCpQ-hM&t=989.6600000000001s)]
*  There's so many dog whistles out there now [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWpWvCpQ-hM&t=991.5400000000001s)]
*  Yeah, you know like just with the internet and just you know that the advertising [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWpWvCpQ-hM&t=993.86s)]
*  So hard to battle it [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWpWvCpQ-hM&t=998.38s)]
*  Yeah, you're getting programmed and you also your your thoughts come from your subconscious, you know [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWpWvCpQ-hM&t=999.9s)]
*  And then you think you thought your thought but you didn't it just kind of popped into your head [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWpWvCpQ-hM&t=1004.6s)]
*  You notice it but see now then but then here's and you you're actually a great case for this because you're like a very [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWpWvCpQ-hM&t=1008.84s)]

*  No, I think I'm just a product of my mother screaming at me as we've covered. Yeah [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWpWvCpQ-hM&t=1035.54s)]

*  Resentment or something and there's like a drift and then we kind of break up. That's usually what happens in my past relationships [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWpWvCpQ-hM&t=3446.1s)]
*  But are you a real hammer in the bedroom or you want like a delicate man's a hammer time really? [[00:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWpWvCpQ-hM&t=3453.1s)]

*  There's he's got a tick-tock account. That's like good for him. It's amazing. But anyway, it's [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWpWvCpQ-hM&t=3690.46s)]
*  I find it's not as funny. Yeah, how many doesn't work when your brain is like wait something's wrong here [[01:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWpWvCpQ-hM&t=3695.62s)]

*  And in the face swap thing I have looks very goofy [[01:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWpWvCpQ-hM&t=3709.14s)]
*  It's clearly like kind of broken but that I did a common essential pilot and we used this extreme deep fake and it was like [[01:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWpWvCpQ-hM&t=3712.26s)]
*  Creepy it was [[01:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWpWvCpQ-hM&t=3718.66s)]
*  They didn't pick it up, huh? No, but I'll tell you this [[01:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWpWvCpQ-hM&t=3720.66s)]
*  It was crazy what I made what I did with their money was crazy. It was awesome. No, it's crazy. It was [[01:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWpWvCpQ-hM&t=3724.94s)]
*  Did you ever put it out? I just put like everything I do and here's what I thought [[01:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWpWvCpQ-hM&t=3731.14s)]
*  I was like, I'm gonna show them that I could lead a sketch show because I do music and these other things [[01:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWpWvCpQ-hM&t=3735.06s)]
*  But then I like I wrote this script and then I thought [[01:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWpWvCpQ-hM&t=3740.06s)]
*  It was like a three-part like a B and C plot time jump script. It's always already confusing [[01:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWpWvCpQ-hM&t=3744.34s)]
*  Yeah, and then I'm like I'm at the commercials and show like my other characters within that [[01:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWpWvCpQ-hM&t=3750.42s)]
*  But you can't jump away from those are things I learned you can't jump away from a narrative story and go somewhere else [[01:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWpWvCpQ-hM&t=3755.06s)]
*  For any more than like 10 seconds, right? Family guy will do a quick joke, but you had to come back to the story [[01:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWpWvCpQ-hM&t=3762.1s)]
*  I would go for like a minute minute and a half [[01:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWpWvCpQ-hM&t=3767.86s)]
*  So then it feels you just churn the channel on the person. It doesn't work. Even it's funny [[01:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWpWvCpQ-hM&t=3769.9s)]
*  They're like why I was watching that other thing [[01:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWpWvCpQ-hM&t=3773.86s)]
*  Then the time jump and the three pods made really confusing it was just so [[01:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWpWvCpQ-hM&t=3775.9s)]
*  It just like you were changing channels. It's crazy [[01:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWpWvCpQ-hM&t=3780.6600000000003s)]
*  Do you is it is it so did you confuse yourself sometimes with kind of the with trying to put it all together? [[01:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWpWvCpQ-hM&t=3782.94s)]
*  Yeah, I'm still trying to figure out how to do a weekly show where I don't lose my mind where I'm satisfying [[01:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWpWvCpQ-hM&t=3789.42s)]
*  People and I have a regular show so I can make a living doing this because right now it's like [[01:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWpWvCpQ-hM&t=3794.86s)]
*  You know, I do show like I started doing this like Sylvester Stallone show which was gaining [[01:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWpWvCpQ-hM&t=3801.7200000000003s)]
*  Followers and stuff but then it's like other people are like there's too much of this [[01:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWpWvCpQ-hM&t=3805.9s)]
*  I stopped doing it and that drops off and those people like where's that? [[01:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWpWvCpQ-hM&t=3810.1400000000003s)]
*  It's just like I got to do one thing and somehow do little clips of everything [[01:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWpWvCpQ-hM&t=3813.5s)]
*  I'm not sure and you were doing Craig's News live five four days a week. I was doing it so much that was just like a [[01:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWpWvCpQ-hM&t=3817.54s)]
*  For me, it's just trial by fire and just yeah, I'll get better if I just keep doing this [[01:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWpWvCpQ-hM&t=3823.1800000000003s)]
*  Yeah, and I was kind of feeling on my butt up. You're gonna you're gonna it's all gonna I mean it's happening [[01:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWpWvCpQ-hM&t=3827.86s)]

*  I can get off the grid with having to worry about a network and all that stuff because what I do [[01:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWpWvCpQ-hM&t=3837.1800000000003s)]
*  I don't think is easily advertised. It's very [[01:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWpWvCpQ-hM&t=3841.1800000000003s)]
*  offensive to a lot of people [[01:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWpWvCpQ-hM&t=3845.34s)]
*  I don't feel it's just genuinely funny or it's well [[01:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWpWvCpQ-hM&t=3847.94s)]
*  I feel like it's not offensive personally because I don't want to hurt. I don't think you know [[01:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWpWvCpQ-hM&t=3850.92s)]
*  I I just know it's it clicks all the buttons of an advertiser says no [[01:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWpWvCpQ-hM&t=3853.94s)]

*  But that's all gonna I feel like slowly that's gonna change. I mean in five years [[01:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWpWvCpQ-hM&t=3860.74s)]
*  Every other person is gonna have a network, you know a small little network [[01:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWpWvCpQ-hM&t=3864.8599999999997s)]
*  Yeah, you can see it like even with podcasts and it's like Rogan was this thing that is like [[01:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWpWvCpQ-hM&t=3869.06s)]
*  insurmountable, you know and then [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWpWvCpQ-hM&t=3875.06s)]

*  There'll just be a bunch of other kind of smaller tiered shows now and then there will be even different ones [[01:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWpWvCpQ-hM&t=3889.34s)]
*  You know and it'll like it's all getting [[01:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWpWvCpQ-hM&t=3895.1800000000003s)]

*  That's the thing. It's like the problem is like people don't want to get off a platform [[01:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWpWvCpQ-hM&t=3952.74s)]
*  They're getting people from Instagram over to my YouTube has been like a sludge [[01:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWpWvCpQ-hM&t=3956.2999999999997s)]

*  Patreon took another thing. So I was like, let me just do it all on YouTube. But [[01:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWpWvCpQ-hM&t=3963.46s)]

*  It's crazy for yeah, California and specifically for LA is an extra percent [[01:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWpWvCpQ-hM&t=3983.34s)]
*  So it's 14% living in California on top of it. Yeah [[01:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWpWvCpQ-hM&t=3987.94s)]

*  I'm sure some of your videos and stuff like that get kind of swept under the rug sometimes based on the [[01:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWpWvCpQ-hM&t=4036.58s)]
*  content and the people [[01:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWpWvCpQ-hM&t=4041.7s)]

*  but we just kind of want to know your feelings on that without getting too political and [[01:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWpWvCpQ-hM&t=4046.74s)]
*  You know see what you think about the algorithms of that's going on on social media right now that kind of favor certain things [[01:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWpWvCpQ-hM&t=4050.62s)]

*  And I really said it Biden stuff might have gotten a little bit banned [[01:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWpWvCpQ-hM&t=4102.7s)]
*  I don't mean to be paranoid [[01:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWpWvCpQ-hM&t=4105.66s)]
*  But when I look at like like percentages and then comments because they don't ban those [[01:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWpWvCpQ-hM&t=4107.0199999999995s)]
*  there's definitely some squelching going on because [[01:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWpWvCpQ-hM&t=4112.7s)]
*  It's not tracking with other videos you could tell [[01:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWpWvCpQ-hM&t=4116.06s)]
*  by like percentage and [[01:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWpWvCpQ-hM&t=4119.700000000001s)]
*  Oh, yeah comments kind of how many views a video gets and the Biden stuff has just been like [[01:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWpWvCpQ-hM&t=4122.18s)]
*  Really squashed on Instagram in particular [[01:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWpWvCpQ-hM&t=4128.740000000001s)]
*  But yeah, I mean it's crazy how much them like the media influence, I mean just politics it's just crazy how much it's gotten [[01:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWpWvCpQ-hM&t=4133.3s)]

*  I think it's like advertisers want to stay away from some political so [[01:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWpWvCpQ-hM&t=4160.38s)]
*  YouTube gets that clue and so you're not gonna be rock me making much money off your video [[01:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWpWvCpQ-hM&t=4164.26s)]

*  I think after this I mean if this one goes through and we get it out there [[01:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWpWvCpQ-hM&t=5801.72s)]

*  I don't know how long it takes for them to process you know [[01:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWpWvCpQ-hM&t=5828.0s)]
*  Question because if you after this if they could get a full on after [[01:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWpWvCpQ-hM&t=5831.5199999999995s)]

*  People yell Caitlin or something [[01:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWpWvCpQ-hM&t=5857.28s)]
*  I'll come out as Craig sometimes, and it's just like I'm jumping around and I want them to enjoy the whole show and it's like [[01:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWpWvCpQ-hM&t=5859.5199999999995s)]

*  I think that's one thing that I don't even recognize at this point like I didn't really realize it till I sat in the audience [[01:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWpWvCpQ-hM&t=5870.44s)]
*  I watched Brendan Shaw perform one night right yeah, and I watched him I sat there [[01:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWpWvCpQ-hM&t=5875.5599999999995s)]

*  But here's just want to be in the room with you [[01:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWpWvCpQ-hM&t=5894.56s)]
*  It's almost like they're saying it almost felt like the fact because this is the vibe [[01:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWpWvCpQ-hM&t=5897.04s)]
*  I got from the fans around me who are watching him that they were just happy [[01:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWpWvCpQ-hM&t=5900.6s)]
*  They just want to be in the room and having a good time with you. Here's where you're wrong, okay? [[01:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWpWvCpQ-hM&t=5904.92s)]
*  You're right about you and Brendan for me [[01:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWpWvCpQ-hM&t=5908.68s)]
*  I don't really exist to most of the people who are who follow me and watch my stuff. It's like Caitlin or [[01:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWpWvCpQ-hM&t=5912.08s)]
*  Biden or Craig it's like someone else like I'm [[01:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWpWvCpQ-hM&t=5920.8s)]
*  I'm actually just starting to put myself. I'm gonna start putting more videos of myself out because I think that is [[01:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWpWvCpQ-hM&t=5925.08s)]
*  the way to [[01:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWpWvCpQ-hM&t=5930.76s)]
*  make more people happy is to [[01:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWpWvCpQ-hM&t=5932.48s)]
*  Have myself involved as like a real person because they're like I'm living and dying off is this funny [[01:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWpWvCpQ-hM&t=5935.16s)]
*  This thing funny and I've always done that was a stand-up boys. I was living and dying. It's like [[01:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWpWvCpQ-hM&t=5940.68s)]

*  My comedy bits my you know impressions or whatever so it's not a hang for them to be with me [[01:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWpWvCpQ-hM&t=5952.68s)]

*  I would be like I want to just know more about who this person is and [[01:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWpWvCpQ-hM&t=5964.360000000001s)]
*  So I think it's almost novel in the way that [[01:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWpWvCpQ-hM&t=5969.12s)]
*  That's where they can get to know more like who's behind this thing that I love [[01:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWpWvCpQ-hM&t=5972.68s)]

*  Someone was like my friends like you should just stand up [[01:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWpWvCpQ-hM&t=6523.88s)]
*  There's another example of someone just telling me what to do. I just did it [[01:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWpWvCpQ-hM&t=6526.28s)]
*  I look back and I like I know and I still struggle. I know impetus to be like I want to do this [[01:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWpWvCpQ-hM&t=6529.04s)]
