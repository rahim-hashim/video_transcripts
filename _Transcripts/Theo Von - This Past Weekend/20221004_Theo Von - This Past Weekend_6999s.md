*  I don't I honestly I think he got involved in a fast food business somehow and then [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=538.18s)]
*  Yeah [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=544.62s)]

*  He was talking about fries something about fry cooking or something like a new oil. I guess that's [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=550.18s)]

*  And that was like oh wow and you got to form at the improv you got a tape of it [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=563.3s)]
*  So it was like man [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=568.22s)]
*  I got it so when you leave there with a tape and you were on stage you feel [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=568.98s)]
*  Totally like you're a comedian you know um, but I didn't really get going until I [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=572.54s)]
*  think I probably went over to the Comedy Store and signed up and Tommy was over there and [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=578.22s)]
*  Yeah, and it was just that's really for me. I think when you really start to feel like okay [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=584.6999999999999s)]
*  I'm dropped in on this you know there is something about the Comedy Store [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=589.24s)]

*  So like immediately people are like whose names are on this wall? How do I get my name on the wall? [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=599.58s)]
*  It looks cool. Oh, there's Jim Carrey in the same font as [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=604.3000000000001s)]

*  Right it's like tricky. It's like screaming from [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=615.1800000000001s)]
*  Blocks away to like look at it and take it in it's powerful plus. It's black and white and red [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=618.4200000000001s)]
*  Yes, it has a very dark [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=625.26s)]
*  You can feel a bit of history in there feels kind of sordid [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=628.26s)]
*  You know you can feel people's energy when they walk through the hall like what's going on with them [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=631.8199999999999s)]
*  Even if they don't say anything you can feel the nervousness of some people you keep running into people [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=636.46s)]
*  You're not even sure if you know them or met them before [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=641.38s)]
*  But yeah when you get up on the stage, it's just like you have to do it [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=645.38s)]
*  So fast forward though now you live in Austin now [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=650.38s)]
*  So you made that move to Austin yeah, and I it's interesting we're talking about the first time on stage because [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=653.9s)]
*  One of the things that like I know you've done kill Tony for a long time. How many shows have you guys done now? [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=659.9s)]

*  for people that don't know kill Tony is [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=671.86s)]
*  Well you tell them what it is you tell them you know well [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=675.46s)]
*  It's like it's like a crazy comedy show where kids are like [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=678.0600000000001s)]
*  It's like a crazy comedy show where comedians watch newer or older [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=681.62s)]
*  Comedians do one minute and they sign up for the chance to get one minute on [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=686.82s)]
*  Interrupted in front of a bunch of fans on the internet and then I interview them afterwards and my guest comedians [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=691.58s)]
*  dosen jokes and you know [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=697.94s)]
*  Contribute and we find out more about the person so not only if I pull their name out of a bunch of people sign up [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=700.94s)]
*  Names go in a bucket I pull their name out they get a minute [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=705.5s)]
*  And then I interview them afterwards so not only do they win like a minute of uninterrupted stand-up [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=708.22s)]
*  But then all of a sudden they they're on a podcast for like eight more minutes [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=712.7s)]
*  Yeah [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=716.14s)]
*  where I interview them and grill them about their life and make jokes about their set and their life and ask some questions and [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=716.62s)]
*  Try to figure out what's different about them [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=722.38s)]
*  I'm sort of like pulling from like you know I was raised on like Howard Stern [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=724.14s)]
*  Old-school interviews like he would always ask the right questions at the right time and like he'd get more [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=729.3000000000001s)]
*  Information than it seemed like he should have out of these people and that's sort of what I'm trying to squeeze out [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=735.1600000000001s)]
*  So sometimes I'll just hit him with what's the weirdest thing in your refrigerator? [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=741.32s)]
*  What's your biggest fear or what's your family? [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=745.0600000000001s)]
*  You're raised by a single mom and like I've asked so many of these questions that I've built sort of a palette kind of yeah [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=748.34s)]
*  To where I know where things are going and I can already tell that paintball. Yeah. Yeah, exactly [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=755.74s)]

*  Then they get up there for one minute dude one minute is not enough time [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=797.1800000000001s)]
*  That's the thing one minute is not enough time to do [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=803.4200000000001s)]
*  Really almost anything sometimes and sometimes it's way too long for some of these people [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=807.74s)]
*  Sometimes it's forever [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=814.6999999999999s)]
*  I was sat there [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=816.6999999999999s)]
*  I just I was amazed at how much man my feeling it took me back to when I first started and there were moments [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=817.62s)]
*  Where you like I remember feeling one time like my face was trying to get behind my skull [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=823.8199999999999s)]
*  So that I didn't have to be there with the like I mean I literally like how where is this? What is going? [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=830.98s)]

*  I mean you can feel the fear and the uncertainty off a lot of these people you can see the beads of sweat that form [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=853.22s)]
*  On their forehead right after the set or in the middle of the set sometimes if things aren't going well [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=859.98s)]
*  And if the set goes good you see the beads form during the interview part [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=864.9000000000001s)]
*  You can sort of tell what they do and don't want to talk about you know [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=868.6600000000001s)]

*  Of and if I make fun of them how they laugh to that if it seems genuine that means I can go even harder [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=899.42s)]
*  Because I don't want to hurt anybody's feelings. You know what I mean. I don't know do you [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=905.5s)]

*  Viewpoints were so different and red band, and I hit the road because we had to do a live podcast [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=1185.26s)]
*  There was no you know everybody else got to go to their studio and keep doing their show [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=1192.02s)]
*  You know and right guys. I was live because it's in front of a live audience. We were dying the hottest death [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=1197.26s)]
*  I mean it was horrible [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=1204.1s)]
*  We tried for a while to have people send in [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=1205.22s)]
*  Minute long clips and then we would live stream the interview and everything's clunky and everybody's internet sucks [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=1207.82s)]
*  And people are just frozen on the screen, and it was just a nightmare plus [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=1213.7s)]
*  There's no laughter and I feed off of that like I always say I'm one of the worst [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=1218.62s)]
*  Podcast guests I get into these things and I like shut down after like 20 30 minutes [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=1223.18s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=1228.54s)]
*  But in front of a live audience I could go I could riff like if we were on a stage with two microphones [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=1229.86s)]
*  We could go for hours. I would have a blast [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=1235.8799999999999s)]
*  So we were dying the slowest death and red band, and I needed a crowd period so how long did you do that? [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=1239.5s)]
*  How long do you guys do that zoom so? [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=1245.3999999999999s)]
*  Traumatizing time in life. I'm guessing it was like two or three months [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=1249.46s)]
*  Wow, did it almost kill the show was ever a thought that maybe the show would stop no I mean [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=1252.94s)]

*  Nashville after like growing old in LA [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=2281.3s)]
*  It's always how I pictured it even though I toured Texas more than anywhere else [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=2284.1800000000003s)]
*  I do Dallas three or four times a year. Yeah, it's crazy [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=2288.38s)]

*  Sometimes I go back to LA for a couple days and I'll do the main room of the Comedy Store [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=2303.04s)]
*  Be in the middle of the lineup for their own shows. I'll leave in a veil and I get whatever I want basically [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=2307.92s)]
*  But my neighborhood was Fairfax and third right by the Grove right by Pan Pacific Park. It was unbelievable [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=2314.2s)]
*  I would go down Fairfax after doing the Comedy Store the improv and you make two quick little right turns [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=2321.64s)]
*  It was like the Batcave in a very [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=2327.0s)]
*  Residential commercial area I would like sneak off into my little end of a one-way [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=2329.92s)]
*  Street it was I had the most amazing setup. Hmm, and then one day [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=2335.64s)]
*  My neighbors like you might want to be careful tomorrow [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=2341.56s)]
*  There's supposed to be some big like rally some big protests BLM, you know, George Floyd [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=2344.2s)]
*  It should be it should get kind of crazy because they're starting it at this park right around the corner [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=2351.08s)]
*  I'm like cool. I'm gonna go to Venice Beach and hang out with my older brothers who live out there, you know [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=2356.16s)]
*  2030 minute drive from there. So I go to the beach. We're chilling on the patio and [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=2361.7999999999997s)]
*  My brother at one point I'll never forget it goes Tony. Come in here. Isn't this your street? [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=2366.7599999999998s)]
*  I'm like what my street and the first thing I notice on the TV is the CNN logo [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=2372.96s)]
*  Like I realized that we're watching the national news not like KTLA or whatever right not somebody's iPhone not a video [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=2377.68s)]
*  Exactly a sketch or something right the time is matched up and I'm looking at a police car on fire [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=2384.42s)]
*  At the bottom of my street and then they cut to another police car on fire and it's the top of my street [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=2390.6600000000003s)]
*  so there's one at Hayworth and [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=2397.2200000000003s)]
*  Third and one at Hayworth and [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=2400.26s)]
*  Beverly. Oh, yeah, that's a damn luau bro. A lot of pork being grilled baby, you know [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=2403.02s)]
*  Damn and it is a sight to see when you're watching the national news and it's clicking back and forth to both sides [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=2407.94s)]
*  I mean literally one block. It is my street like it is it's there's only probably [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=2413.9s)]
*  40 houses there and one of them is mine [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=2420.7400000000002s)]
*  So that spooked you spooked the hell out of me. So I go that I'm like, I literally remember saying I think I have to go [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=2424.26s)]
*  Yeah [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=2431.06s)]
*  and so I got in my car and [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=2431.46s)]
*  Tried to make it there cuz I'm like at least I'm gonna defend it because I'm gonna grab my laptop, right? [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=2433.54s)]
*  Exactly all the little stuff the what my dad's dad's watch or whatever the little things [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=2438.9s)]
*  My grandpa's earrings, dude, if your grandpa was clogged or whatever [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=2444.9s)]
*  Gotta have Papa's butt plug, you know what I mean? [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=2452.02s)]
*  Anyway, and I barely make it there another thing that stuck in my memory is like I was trying to get back to my place [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=2455.7s)]
*  And there's a riot crew of [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=2464.14s)]
*  American like blacked out [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=2468.5s)]
*  shields guns [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=2471.22s)]
*  Everything moving down the street and I'm like, oh I have to take side streets. They're about to block this off [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=2472.8599999999997s)]
*  so like I'm hustling scurrying like a rat to get back to [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=2478.18s)]
*  My place and then that's where it really sets in because the chaos was there the Sun goes down and that's where [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=2482.56s)]
*  you know a lot of people and the news never covered it like they [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=2489.62s)]
*  should have and [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=2493.78s)]
*  But it was it was the end of the Joker movie. It was complete Gotham City [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=2495.62s)]
*  They lit the Trader Joe's behind me on fire [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=2499.62s)]
*  Like my the back of my building was to a Trader Joe's like and it's on fire and the fire alarms are going off and [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=2502.36s)]
*  smokes pouring out of broken windows and the paper source across from that [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=2509.5s)]
*  Windows are busted out fire alarms are going off [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=2515.2400000000002s)]
*  Fire's everywhere graffiti everywhere on [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=2518.7s)]
*  Trees on telephone poles on cars on the street on the ground on the cement on the sides of buildings [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=2522.7s)]
*  Like the whole thing exploded [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=2530.1s)]
*  It was so much worse than people ever know because the next morning the whole neighborhood who takes great pride in [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=2532.2599999999998s)]
*  Living in that area fucking went out there with [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=2539.02s)]
*  Rags and pressure washers and brooms and I couldn't believe it. It was actually sort of an emotional trip [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=2542.46s)]
*  I went for a drive down third up La Cienega down [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=2548.38s)]
*  Beverly up Fairfax down Melrose and I could not believe what I was seeing people all out there [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=2552.34s)]
*  cleaning and fixing it and [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=2559.34s)]
*  I think there's sort of a catch to that is people never really found out exactly what happened there [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=2562.98s)]
*  Exactly what happened there right it was chaos and it wasn't that neighborhood it wasn't people from around there [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=2568.02s)]
*  It was you know a different thing coming up from Long Beach or whatever [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=2573.4199999999996s)]
*  But then you immediately realize like wow well this place this can happen here. It just happened right so whatever just happened can happen here [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=2577.4199999999996s)]
*  And let me tell you something two years in Texas. I can say with no hesitation [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=2584.9799999999996s)]
*  It would never happen there. It's absolutely [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=2588.9799999999996s)]
*  Impossible for that to happen there. I was always maybe people shouldn't know you know what I mean [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=2592.14s)]
*  I didn't know where I didn't really have a stance on guns [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=2596.66s)]
*  I was too busy only caring about comedy wrote didn't really you know that's another thing about Texas is like I'm alive now [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=2598.8199999999997s)]
*  Doing things I'm golfing and then going to the range and then doing a spot and then you know [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=2606.02s)]
*  Having a nice day, and yeah exactly [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=2612.02s)]
*  I mean that was one nice thing that I thought it just like I got I have to be somewhere where I can [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=2614.06s)]
*  Where things are open yeah? [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=2618.7s)]
*  I can't just totally go along with this thing that like it just felt insane to me [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=2620.2599999999998s)]
*  And and because that's just my natural instincts other people's are different [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=2626.06s)]
*  I respect that but totally so I wanted to be in a place that was open [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=2629.9s)]
*  Yeah, what do you feel like the comedy scene is different like in Austin? [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=2633.58s)]
*  compared to La like oh [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=2637.9s)]
*  Will it do you think Austin can actually I don't know if anything can compete with some of these bigger markets [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=2639.98s)]
*  You know just because of the volume of people I hear you I think that I [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=2645.08s)]
*  Think the difference is the industry isn't in Austin like [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=2651.54s)]
*  You know Netflix headquarters and these a lot of people. I think we've lived through an age of [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=2656.02s)]
*  Stand-up comedy to where we've watched the complete evolution we watched to go from okay [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=2662.98s)]
*  well you got to have clean three minutes for the tonight show or [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=2667.6s)]
*  You know a decently clean 22 minutes for a Comedy Central half-hour [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=2671.9s)]
*  to [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=2677.1s)]
*  You know okay? [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=2678.1s)]
*  You could be a little bit edgier on Netflix and do an hour [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=2678.9s)]
*  And then it's like kind of like on Netflix is sort of cutting down on edginess like unless you're really established [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=2682.2s)]
*  they're gonna give you notes and and [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=2689.52s)]
*  I think that it's Wild West [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=2691.96s)]
*  Comedy happening in Austin, which is you know obviously what people want you know people go to a strip club [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=2695.0s)]
*  You don't want to see you know a girl in a bikini. No you want to see fucking. I want to hear the n-word [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=2700.8399999999997s)]
*  You're damn right. Yeah, I see some buttholes. Yeah, I want to see a misplaced ingrown hairs [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=2706.52s)]
*  Sparklers yeah, I want to see it all mm-hmm. I want to see a girl bringing a you know a candle to the table [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=2711.9s)]
*  But just you know walking on her hands. You know I want to see somebody hell [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=2717.06s)]
*  Yeah, I want to see yeah [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=2720.58s)]
*  Yeah, I think what one thing I noticed in Austin was that they stay you guys locked the phones up over there [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=2721.86s)]
*  You know yep phones are locked up, and that's to you know our shows are still recorded [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=2726.86s)]
*  We have you know cameras rolling on everything because one thing that we've learned is that it's good to have your own footage [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=2732.5s)]
*  So that it can't be taken out of context right I've always thought that when someone goes for an interview on any type of net [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=2738.86s)]
*  or anything [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=2745.46s)]
*  they should [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=2746.7400000000002s)]
*  Also, if it's a if it's a ground where they don't trust maybe that they will be [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=2748.78s)]
*  Portrayed accurately they should have someone record at the same time for them. That's what we're doing so that way it's like [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=2754.42s)]
*  There'll be no real misconceptions here 100% because it can happen [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=2762.34s)]
*  You know it can happen to anyone at any point [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=2766.86s)]
*  You know even in that crazy video that happened with me that made me look like a horrible horrible human being [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=2769.38s)]
*  Oh, yeah with the Asian stuff. Yeah, 20 that Hans Kim was that now it was a different guy [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=2775.42s)]
*  but 25 seconds after that his edited version of the video I [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=2780.38s)]
*  Had my own video recording of the entire thing in which you know 25 seconds after his ends [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=2785.94s)]
*  I end up going come on lady relax. You're looking at me like I'm serious over here about it a babbitt about you know joke about that [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=2792.38s)]
*  Yeah, about that. I'm into jokes like there was no like scene [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=2798.38s)]
*  It wasn't the chaotic breakdown that it looks like on the you know 20 second clip that the person released [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=2802.1000000000004s)]
*  It's you know it was a random casual Thursday comedy show [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=2809.94s)]
*  I actually yelled at Bobby Lee when I saw him a couple months ago in LA [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=2814.7200000000003s)]
*  That was all your fault by the way you let me call you those words for fucking over a decade without telling me there was [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=2818.5s)]
*  Something wrong. Well, that's one of the issues people look at there's always that bait Asian [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=2824.12s)]
*  Yeah, and they will they let you say all kind of things or this or that or joke around with them [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=2827.54s)]

*  Wow, you know spending the whole 15 first years of my career in LA. I never would have guessed that another option would work [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=3504.12s)]
*  I'm amazed at that too living here. Yeah, exactly, you know and like all of a sudden you're comfortable and you're a little bit better [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=3512.98s)]
*  Rested and you have maybe a new hobby or something something to you know, cuz I think in LA it's or New York perhaps [[00:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=3519.7400000000002s)]
*  It's easy to just be like I got to work. I got to work. It's only about the next joke [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=3526.94s)]
*  You know what I mean? I got a I got a but then you're not living you're not experiencing things. You're not taking note [[00:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=3531.06s)]
*  You're not having great conversations where you say something that you realize might be good on stage [[00:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=3536.46s)]
*  Like living is a huge part of what we do [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=3541.96s)]
*  Right. I agree [[00:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=3545.98s)]
*  and I think one of the things that's happened to Hollywood over the years is [[00:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=3547.46s)]
*  It used to be that people went people had these like wild like people went there with their energy and and like made [[00:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=3551.02s)]
*  Their dreams happen wrote scripts and but now it's been so much [[00:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=3558.82s)]
*  like the children of children and nepotism and you know third generation screen, right that it's like [[00:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=3563.82s)]
*  The people writing the things and creating the things they're not they don't have as much life experience anymore [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=3570.86s)]
*  Maybe their grandfather did maybe their mother did [[00:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=3577.8199999999997s)]
*  But they're still kind of riding off of those old stories and energies [[00:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=3581.54s)]
*  so they're not as tuned in to some of the reality of [[00:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=3585.18s)]
*  of just like [[00:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=3589.5s)]
*  Of creativity really, you know another thing that I think is that it's much easier for people to be jealous and competitive [[00:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=3591.7799999999997s)]
*  There's a lot of billboards there. I noticed that my last trip there. I'm like, wow, I just always [[00:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=3599.7999999999997s)]
*  Didn't know it like I mean the billboards were just part of like the skyline. It's just a tree. It's like blends in with LA [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=3607.74s)]
*  And as I'm looking up there, I'm realizing. Oh my god, that show looks like crap [[01:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=3616.22s)]
*  That show looks like crap that movie has it looks it tells its whole script right there in the billboard like and I'm judging [[01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=3620.4199999999996s)]
*  These billboards and I realized like this whole place does that to people like all of a sudden? [[01:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=3628.7799999999997s)]
*  I'm daydreaming about why does that idiot have a show that's not gonna work Wow Comedy Central's dead as hell [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=3634.86s)]
*  You know, you're looking at the field itself [[01:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=3641.9s)]
*  Yeah, and I'm looking at these billboards and I realized I'm thinking about this they have me thinking about these [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=3643.78s)]
*  Things which in Austin you can't there is no like oh [[01:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=3650.78s)]
*  I wish I had that or this person would be better for that or this is where that should be like [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=3654.54s)]
*  Right so it takes a lot of that business and the jealousy and the like [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=3660.58s)]
*  Oh look at the it takes a lot of that glitz out of it and stuff like that [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=3664.34s)]
*  And also it's like these people, you know in LA and New York [[01:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=3668.5s)]
*  It's the last stand because we've learned now that the podcast is the way you can have your own show and build your own [[01:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=3671.86s)]
*  Fans with people that are into what you're into and like the sound of your voice and want to hear it [[01:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=3678.38s)]
*  So that old model of like alright [[01:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=3683.38s)]
*  Let's throw this to the people and see who likes it like it's old school model [[01:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=3685.5s)]
*  And it takes away from the ability to build something and now people are like well if I didn't start a podcast now [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=3690.58s)]
*  I can't start now. I'm in too deep now, but it's like who knows it's like Bitcoin or NFTs or whatever [[01:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=3697.34s)]
*  Like who knows what the anything is? Yeah [[01:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=3702.98s)]
*  Well, there are some things that are great about LA too, though [[01:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=3706.3s)]
*  It's like the weather is absolutely unbeatable. You can't beat it. There's no there's not even any question about it [[01:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=3709.06s)]
*  I don't know if there's anywhere in the world. You can beat the weather there. Yeah, there's barely any bugs [[01:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=3714.92s)]
*  There's no allergies in the air. No poisonous animals [[01:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=3719.02s)]
*  Yeah, Jesus man a third of my childhood was filled with fucking poisonous animals dangerous animals [[01:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=3722.66s)]
*  street animals fucking nighttime animals fucking [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=3728.14s)]
*  Just fucking mean owls everything man. It was all fuck just harrowing dude [[01:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=3732.22s)]
*  I remember one time my brother and I are sleeping our bedroom, right a fucking owl like a nighttime owl or whatever [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=3736.32s)]
*  Shattered right through the fucking window in our bedroom dude dude scared me so bad, but we had no idea what it was [[01:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=3743.74s)]
*  We didn't know if it was like a burglar or what you know [[01:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=3750.66s)]
*  That means someone in your family is gonna die soon if an owl flies through your window. Oh, yeah, everybody died [[01:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=3752.62s)]
*  So yeah, I wish I'd have known that at the time though [[01:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=3759.98s)]
*  But there are things that are great about it the access to people that are there is also nice like, you know [[01:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=3763.1s)]
*  I have friends like my friend James Blake lives there [[01:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=3769.08s)]
*  He's a musician and he's like I would have never got to meet him if I didn't live in LA and it is kind of name-dropping [[01:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=3771.92s)]
*  But he's also like one of the most unique people that I get to talk to like all of us and that would have never met [[01:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=3777.68s)]
*  Each other if we had if it hadn't have been for LA. Oh, yeah, I'm grateful for it [[01:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=3783.52s)]
*  Just like I'm grateful for Youngstown [[01:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=3787.44s)]
*  I think that you know being from a place and living and having the experiences of being in you know, a diabolical place [[01:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=3789.08s)]
*  Gets you to appreciate everything that happens after that right like you wouldn't be quite as P at peace here in Nashville if you [[01:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=3797.2s)]
*  Didn't know that it takes an hour and a half [[01:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=3805.3599999999997s)]
*  Sometimes to drive from one gig to another in LA or from the airport to your house in LA [[01:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=3807.8799999999997s)]
*  Those little things like here you get up at the airport. You're here in 10 15 minutes, right? [[01:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=3813.8799999999997s)]
*  Yeah, same thing with me [[01:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=3819.04s)]
*  in fact [[01:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=3820.12s)]
*  I try to set new records each time the airports like a place that now I have like great pride and [[01:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=3820.92s)]
*  Trying to get home in like seven minutes or eight minutes. It's crazy [[01:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=3826.64s)]
*  Yeah, I guess there's yeah, there's definitely a lot of things and it's also like this is part of the journey it's like [[01:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=3832.12s)]
*  You know [[01:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=3838.44s)]
*  Communication like is more free on podcasts [[01:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=3840.92s)]
*  And so it would make sense that maybe they expand out to different areas over time [[01:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=3843.24s)]
*  It's been really interesting to be in a different place and have access to different guests and like unique people that [[01:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=3846.8799999999997s)]
*  Normally may not have be able to get on a certain platforms or weren't even able to get on like kind of podcasts and stuff [[01:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=3854.4s)]
*  So that's been really interesting and kind of seeing like what's who's the next person that I'm gonna get to meet that would be [[01:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=3861.4s)]
*  Like really really really awesome to have come on from you like we got Mike Rowe is gonna come on, right? [[01:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=3867.8s)]
*  So I'm really excited about that. Like I don't know if I would be able to have him on if I weren't in this area [[01:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=3872.3s)]
*  So, um, yeah, there's different things about it and I can go back to LA whenever it's always there [[01:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=3877.08s)]
*  It's still like you go back the Comedy Store the improv places that I love the laugh actors become [[01:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=3881.8s)]
*  It's it's still great. It's gotten better. Actually just busy over there. So the stages are still there [[01:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=3888.36s)]
*  And it's fun. And yeah, man, when I go back to the store, it is a party. Those are my people [[01:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=3895.5600000000004s)]
*  You know those people that have worked there forever [[01:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=3901.6000000000004s)]
*  You know, we're so close and [[01:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=3905.4s)]
*  We have so much fun and it's like a reunion it's like a different vibe instead of being there all the time [[01:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=3907.88s)]
*  It's like, you know, it's like going home and visiting [[01:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=3913.84s)]
*  You're in a family. Yeah in a hometown [[01:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=3917.6s)]

*  It's like you you have to do that [[01:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=3927.52s)]
*  like you have to kind of champion where you are to an extent in order to be able to survive there and [[01:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=3929.04s)]
*  And have like a nice perspective every day [[01:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=3934.6s)]
*  Let's talk. What's some news that's going on? What do we got daddy? Oh [[01:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=3938.2000000000003s)]

*  Which it's almost impossible to steal over a thousand dollars worth of stuff [[01:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=4817.5s)]
*  You know in one trip, but we ain't one trip. Yeah. Yeah. So yeah, I'm not gonna supermarket sweep show [[01:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=4821.78s)]

*  Relationship with the other people in the store. What's going on? [[01:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=4848.66s)]
*  Where do I kind of position myself a little bit? [[01:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=4851.42s)]
*  Like it makes you kind of pay attention a little bit more [[01:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=4854.34s)]
*  I do notice myself kind of having a little bit more inside of my surroundings, which is good [[01:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=4856.76s)]
*  But also it makes me kind of more fearful of just people which I feel like is kind of bad [[01:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=4861.860000000001s)]

*  If the ceiling was just 12 inches lower, I think it would be even better than perfect [[01:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=5157.360000000001s)]
*  And we were like and you know, it's just you're watching the magic happen. Joe looks at the construction [[01:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=5164.68s)]

*  So those little tiny screws on like this Boeing 737 are being tightened [[01:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=5176.96s)]
*  Yeah, and the entrances and like the class of it is gonna be crazy. Like it's gonna be heaven [[01:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=5182.56s)]
*  It's gonna be what we loved about the comedy store [[01:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=5188.5s)]
*  But also with a little bit of a rock and roll and also a little bit of like the shining vibe [[01:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=5191.92s)]
*  You know that hotel from the shining. Yeah, I'd be like sort of really classy and cool like that [[01:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=5197.4800000000005s)]
*  But also dark and creepy too. So magic we're really excited [[01:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=5202.92s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, I could feel just excitement even when he was walking me through it [[01:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=5208.16s)]
*  You could feel like you know, it's interesting to see somebody like that get excited [[01:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=5211.38s)]
*  You know who's had it so many unique things happen to them in their life. Yeah, it's cool to see somebody get excited [[01:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=5215.88s)]
*  Do you think that Joe would ever start a platform? [[01:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=5220.280000000001s)]
*  Because obviously having a club is amazing, right? It's a it's a tangible thing where you're right there [[01:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=5223.52s)]
*  You can get up on stage, you know, it's like this is the real art. Yeah, but I wonder if he ever creates like a [[01:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=5229.16s)]
*  You know like his like his own YouTube or like his own because I feel like he would be the one obviously, you know [[01:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=5235.68s)]
*  He has the most gravitational pull he could and the thing is I think he already has [[01:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=5241.3s)]
*  I think that he just doesn't want need or want all the credit, you know what I mean? [[01:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=5246.96s)]
*  It doesn't need to be called the Rogan Network [[01:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=5253.26s)]
*  He just pushes the things that he believes in you know, I mean, I think we're all part of that extension [[01:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=5255.2s)]
*  I mean there is no question that he is that his show is the new [[01:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=5261.44s)]
*  Carson it's the new tonight show like getting on it and being part of that universe. It means you're going to get bigger [[01:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=5266.32s)]
*  Even when they came after him even when they tried to cancel him he got bigger everything [[01:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=5273.88s)]
*  Just gets bigger even I when all the crazy stuff happened to me and there's a few days where I'm like [[01:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=5279.36s)]
*  Oh my god, am I about to go be a crab fisherman in Alaska? [[01:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=5284.18s)]
*  Like what the fuck am I about to do and to see that? Oh my god, everything got a thousand times better [[01:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=5287.5599999999995s)]
*  Like it's you know [[01:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=5293.04s)]
*  So I think he sort of already has this universe, you know, and you know if they ever [[01:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=5295.32s)]
*  Really really really come down on free speech and you know if YouTube gets crazy or anything like that then [[01:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=5302.38s)]
*  You know, there's totally something that's gonna have to happen [[01:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=5309.88s)]
*  But I think right now he's he's doing [[01:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=5314.74s)]
*  Everything he can for like other people. It's incredible. Yeah, he you know one thing that's not often talked about is [[01:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=5318.099999999999s)]
*  you know, sometimes you'll go see some of the biggest comedians on planet Earth and [[01:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=5326.139999999999s)]
*  You'll notice that they're opening acts like aren't always really like they're not like their own killers [[01:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=5330.9800000000005s)]
*  like you know what I mean like like going back to last night like I'm like I I [[01:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=5337.46s)]
*  Wasn't like oh [[01:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=5342.18s)]
*  Hey, oh, you know what I mean? Cuz we we've always done this dance [[01:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=5344.82s)]
*  We've been going up before and after one another for over a decade continuously [[01:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=5348.54s)]
*  I and this comes you know, and this is something that Joe and I have always had in common is like we thrive [[01:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=5352.54s)]
*  We love the idea of giving the people the best possible human crazy-ass show and [[01:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=5359.16s)]
*  Pulling it off, you know, it's not fear-driven [[01:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=5366.599999999999s)]
*  Like I think a lot of people are because he's not like that [[01:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=5370.08s)]
*  Yeah, he's not like Joe wrote or Joey Diaz to feature for him in an arena in Atlantic City [[01:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=5372.72s)]
*  You know and and all this chaos and Ari Shaffir and Duncan and all these wild people you me all the you know [[01:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=5378.8s)]
*  Who wants to really follow that it's someone that wants to get better and help people that he thinks are the best and you know [[01:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=5385.76s)]
*  So he doesn't have an element of not having the fear driven. Yeah [[01:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=5393.2s)]
*  I mean if he followed Chappelle in that arena in Columbus two weeks ago like butter like it was nothing and it was you know [[01:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=5396.6s)]
*  He doesn't have that part in him. He doesn't have that fear thing. Exactly fear is not a factor for him [[01:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=5404.64s)]
*  It really isn't that crazy. Yeah [[01:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=5409.9800000000005s)]
*  No, it's really isn't if it was you'd never fight I don't think you could see it [[01:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=5412.4s)]
*  He's a diabolical human being like I mean, you know, obviously he has a just like anybody nowadays [[01:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=5417.5199999999995s)]
*  There's a ton of haters out there that can pick apart this like a horse paced [[01:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=5424.2s)]
*  But like anything you try to get them on it's easily provable that [[01:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=5428.64s)]
*  Right, you're just wrong like people that are you know, oh, he's not a good stand-up [[01:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=5434.4s)]
*  Well, you're crazy because all of your favorite stand-ups think he's an unbelievable stand-up comedian every single one of your favorite [[01:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=5439.32s)]
*  Comedians thinks he's a great comedian knows he's a great comedian [[01:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=5447.48s)]
*  He's been doing it three decades just cuz you know him from a podcast or from my vermectin or from CNN [[01:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=5451.04s)]
*  It doesn't change what reality is there's a lot of opinions out there [[01:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=5456.32s)]
*  Yeah, but someone like him and it's so rare. There's not even there's not even a second place like he's like [[01:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=5460.66s)]
*  You know the as far as helping people and [[01:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=5466.84s)]
*  You know staying humble [[01:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=5470.599999999999s)]
*  He's an incredible inspiration in that way and I think [[01:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=5472.92s)]
*  Yeah, it's easy for that to slip away and once someone thinks that they have it all figured out [[01:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=5476.84s)]
*  I think that's when it starts to slip and he doesn't do that constantly writing [[01:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=5481.719999999999s)]
*  He is his new his hour now the one I saw two months ago [[01:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=5486.5199999999995s)]
*  Man [[01:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=5491.400000000001s)]
*  It was it's I mean you don't want to say it's the best stuff [[01:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=5492.4800000000005s)]
*  I've seen him do but that's okay to say it's the I think he's done a lot of really really great stuff [[01:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=5495.4800000000005s)]
*  It's the best stuff that I've seen him do and you do want to say that about people [[01:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=5500.76s)]
*  Because you do want them to continue to you know, yeah [[01:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=5504.400000000001s)]
*  It's like 20 years in to be doing the best stuff. It's where you're supposed to be really exactly [[01:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=5507.34s)]
*  But man if fucking that shit really really floored me [[01:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=5511.8s)]
*  I think there's something about you know, mainstream media going after him that made him want to be even better [[01:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=5514.12s)]
*  Hmm, I'll show you idiots. I saw the same thing yesterday [[01:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=5519.88s)]
*  I was hanging out with my buddy John Rich country music star that I told me about him [[01:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=5522.8s)]
*  I gotta get him on here. He's amazing and [[01:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=5526.96s)]
*  He's you know, he leans hard, right harder, right than some of those faces on Bell's palsy [[01:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=5530.04s)]
*  But everything he says makes liberty bells palsy [[01:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=5538.88s)]

*  And he's just he's got the best intentions and he's a great guy and they come after him all the time because he's like [[01:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=5548.88s)]
*  I think everybody should have gone he's on Fox News sometimes. You know what I mean? Like he is [[01:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=5554.719999999999s)]

*  What he thinks is right and what a lot of people it turns out think is right thinks is right and they've come after [[01:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=5561.88s)]

*  Nobody talked about it. None of the media and [[01:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=5578.64s)]
*  nobody because he didn't use one of the big record labels and he because he criticizes the [[01:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=5581.76s)]
*  He criticizes the [[01:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=5591.52s)]
*  The [[01:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=5593.64s)]
*  Censorship of Twitter and Facebook and YouTube in the lyrics [[01:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=5595.96s)]
*  So he decided he's not gonna promote it on any of those things. So he literally just promoted it through [[01:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=5600.360000000001s)]

*  He's above Lizzo. He's above Taylor Swift [[01:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=5618.92s)]
*  Above all of these things and he's talking about these things that he's always felt and we made this correlation him and I were like [[01:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=5621.5199999999995s)]
*  Whoa [[01:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=5629.12s)]
*  Because we've both you know [[01:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=5630.28s)]
*  We've been living in this world the last couple years where people are trying to chop you down and it makes you more of who [[01:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=5631.839999999999s)]

*  He's always been that but now the lyrics are clear [[01:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=5644.4s)]
*  He's literally saying what he wants just like how I've doubled down in my stand-up and now I'm only [[01:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=5647.08s)]
*  Exclusively talking about stuff that I shouldn't be talking about and I have all those premises to myself because so many people are you know [[01:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=5653.68s)]
*  Obviously you want to be on Netflix you want to be on this you want to be on HBO sure [[01:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=5660.04s)]
*  Who doesn't want to be but the reality is that none of my stuff could be there [[01:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=5663.46s)]
*  It would literally just cause a riot, you know, people would just quit or whatever, right? [[01:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=5668.66s)]
*  But but the people love it it's that live show effective like whoa, we're doing it. Oh my goodness [[01:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=5672.719999999999s)]

*  Where are we as you evolve to because you had a special on Netflix a few years back? [[01:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=5683.04s)]
*  Yep, but as you evolve it's like yeah if the platforms won't allow [[01:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=5687.839999999999s)]
*  Certain stuff or they don't just see okay. This is just humor. That's for some people not for some whatever [[01:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=5694.04s)]
*  But if they only want to kind of navigate a certain area or only willing to go to certain which like [[01:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=5701.72s)]
*  You know banisters, which is their right, but it does create [[01:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=5708.2s)]
*  Not only for putting things out on YouTube, but really for going to see live comedy [[01:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=5713.8s)]

*  So like it doesn't tell you that staying number one for 12 days is its own insane [[01:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=5878.62s)]
*  accomplishment that those things are always rotating and jumping around and [[01:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=5884.74s)]
*  There it is a dollar 29 and boom and he gives you know percentages of his earnings [[01:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=5889.66s)]
*  To he has his own scholarship where he gives money for kids to go to college [[01:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=5897.38s)]
*  Who if they had a parent die in the military he pays for their college [[01:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=5902.94s)]
*  He's given over a million dollars to put kids through college [[01:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=5907.48s)]
*  Oh [[01:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=5911.54s)]
*  So you find out that some of these bad guys are the good guys and that the good guys you look at [[01:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=5912.42s)]
*  Catholic priests and stuff like do good do this [[01:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=5918.94s)]
*  That's why like virtue signaling and a lot of and I keep ragging on LA [[01:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=5921.799999999999s)]
*  But it's like, you know [[01:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=5926.179999999999s)]
*  a lot of these people that want to work in the industry say all these things and they're always [[01:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=5927.219999999999s)]
*  This is wrong and that's wrong. Why we know you know, what about science and all these different things, but [[01:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=5931.5s)]
*  It almost seems like the good guys sometimes are the bad guys, right the politicians. Oh, yeah [[01:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=5938.54s)]
*  All I've always hated politicians, right [[01:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=5944.58s)]
*  And but I think we start to see that that whole mold all that it's not it's not really working [[01:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=5947.9400000000005s)]
*  I think you know for a long time people believed in it. There's something good here. Yeah, but I think after especially after [[01:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=5954.52s)]
*  The pandemic [[01:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=5963.1s)]
*  After people being scared in a lot of cities, you know in violence [[01:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=5966.22s)]
*  I think people are starting to just wonder what's going on here. I think it's yeah [[01:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=5969.860000000001s)]
*  it's deeper than just [[01:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=5974.38s)]
*  like in our daily lie [[01:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=5976.620000000001s)]
*  It's like this bigger thing like does this society that we constructed and that we've been [[01:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=5979.3s)]
*  building and riding [[01:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=5985.900000000001s)]
*  What's gonna happen to it? Like which way is it gonna go? You know [[01:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=5987.700000000001s)]
*  In perspective right like the other night after a kill Tony taping. I was telling my producer guy that I [[01:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=5991.9400000000005s)]
*  Go, it's so crazy. I just had five different people come up to me and literally say the same thing of I can't believe [[01:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=6000.0599999999995s)]
*  That you get to be mean to people for two hours every week on a show [[01:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=6008.0599999999995s)]
*  For a living and I go and I had another five totally different people on my way up to the green room say I [[01:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=6013.54s)]
*  can't believe that you have created a format to help people and [[01:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=6021.3s)]
*  You're the only person giving these random people a shot to be seen and it's funny how [[01:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=6026.74s)]
*  They're all at the same show and these people are seeing two different shows kind of yeah [[01:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=6033.62s)]
*  What I mean, and I think it's that way sort of for everything nowadays [[01:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=6038.54s)]
*  Sometimes something can be right there and we choose [[01:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=6042.3s)]
*  What we like about it or what we don't like about it, right? [[01:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=6046.58s)]
*  Well, it's bummer to sometimes I just like I wish I could press a button more and get a different perspectives [[01:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=6049.9800000000005s)]
*  Like it's like sometimes I'm like man. I'm so [[01:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=6055.9s)]
*  I'm not inhibited. I am inhibited by my own perspective [[01:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=6058.94s)]
*  Not that it's right or wrong. Sometimes it's both but that it's like man [[01:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=6062.7s)]
*  I wonder what life is if you're what has life seemed like if you're [[01:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=6067.9s)]
*  this person if you're a woman if you're a man if you're black or [[01:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=6073.42s)]
*  What is it Japanese, you know, it or you know [[01:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=6080.0199999999995s)]
*  I've just like wonder what it all seems like, you know [[01:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=6083.58s)]
*  Because then it's like yeah my views off are they on is it okay if they're [[01:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=6087.7s)]
*  Just right for me in my own space, you know [[01:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=6093.18s)]
*  I think that's the part that starts to feel kind of scary sometimes it's like well, these are my views for my perception [[01:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=6096.94s)]
*  Is it okay to share them if I can't get everybody if I can't? [[01:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=6104.26s)]
*  You know how is it okay to share them if even if I'm without taking in the context [[01:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=6109.62s)]
*  What other people's views are like it's just it's hard, right? It's hard sometimes. Yeah, you know [[01:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=6115.46s)]
*  Because you try to you want to be open-minded you want but you also want to respect what you intrinsically feel [[01:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=6121.42s)]
*  You know and I think that's another place another area where the pandemic hit hard [[01:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=6126.9800000000005s)]
*  Like people like me and you that went out and we're like we need to be around stuff that's open [[01:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=6132.46s)]
*  We're like we need to be around stuff that's open [[01:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=6136.82s)]
*  We need to go out once in a while listen to music or just be around people or just be somewhere that's open [[01:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=6138.46s)]
*  You know, that's a character trait [[01:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=6144.54s)]
*  You know what I mean, and I think that a lot of people that stayed in and stayed locked down and things like this [[01:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=6147.0199999999995s)]
*  created almost a little bit of [[01:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=6154.219999999999s)]
*  bitterness towards those that might speak a little bit more freely because we know people better because we're [[01:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=6157.219999999999s)]
*  Socializing more and out more and we might have a Japanese friend or a black woman or this or a transgender or this or that? [[01:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=6165.1s)]
*  Or anything so we sort of can speak more freely because we feel like we know these people and this and that and meanwhile some [[01:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=6172.22s)]
*  You know person who's at home on the internet who never goes out can be like, you know [[01:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=6180.54s)]
*  You shouldn't even be talking about right? This is what we have to it because it also caters to that person's life [[01:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=6186.98s)]
*  But also guys like you and me I think we never really liked the rules, right? You've never liked the rules. Hell no [[01:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=6192.34s)]
*  No [[01:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=6199.58s)]
*  Never you've never liked the rules [[01:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=6200.58s)]
*  And so anytime there's rules or some type of control that comes in average. I really don't like that [[01:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=6202.22s)]
*  Right it it hits in a place of me. I don't want to be [[01:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=6208.18s)]
*  You know, I think it goes back to just my childhood [[01:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=6212.1s)]
*  I didn't like where we were I didn't like the whole position that I got put into in my life when I was young [[01:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=6214.02s)]
*  So it's like I'll reject anything that tries to fucking make me be some type of way, right? [[01:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=6219.38s)]
*  It's a blessing and a curse. I think sometimes [[01:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=6225.1s)]
*  But [[01:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=6228.86s)]
*  What else so your dad passed away when you were a kid, I know you mentioned that earlier now he was he's alive [[01:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=6230.66s)]
*  And what type of job did he have he ran an Italian restaurant did some? [[01:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=6237.1s)]
*  some bookie-ing basically Youngstown sort of like a little [[01:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=6242.18s)]
*  Italian mafia hub so everybody there when I was a kid was [[01:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=6246.5s)]
*  Involved in organized crime in some effect or another including my mom who was running numbers for the whole city [[01:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=6250.78s)]
*  it was a big illegal gambling operation that she used just to put me through a [[01:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=6256.98s)]
*  The private school there and make sure that I had a new pair of Nikes once a year [[01:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=6261.98s)]
*  You know what I mean? I was like poor [[01:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=6266.0199999999995s)]
*  Do you have the cards? [[01:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=6268.0199999999995s)]
*  When you send with you put the cards out to people and they would circle the games and that sort of thing. Yeah [[01:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=6268.94s)]
*  Yeah, well it was mostly like betting mostly like you call and it's like alright [[01:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=6273.32s)]
*  I'll put 20 on the Packers and and but the thing that my mom was doing was also like writing down [[01:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=6278.16s)]
*  numbers so you could play like the pick three lottery or the pick four lottery and [[01:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=6284.28s)]
*  It was like straight or box, which means you're playing it straight up or the three numbers come out. Anyway [[01:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=6290.32s)]
*  It was it's crazy that I used to like just see her on the phone like writing down numbers [[01:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=6297.44s)]
*  And like doing it all the time and collecting [[01:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=6303.32s)]

*  It's crazy wild times, but it's a lot of unacceptance [[01:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=6383.06s)]
*  It feels like it probably felt like you don't really fit in with any [[01:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=6386.94s)]
*  Exactly luckily my four older brothers and sisters on my mom's side were super open like no you're a hinge cliff [[01:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=6390.379999999999s)]

*  Every summer when I was out of school [[01:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=6427.96s)]
*  And I would just get to hang out with my brothers and sisters who were going to the Ohio State University [[01:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=6430.320000000001s)]

*  And I would try to make them laugh, and I would do goofy stuff [[01:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=6446.9s)]
*  You got to fit in magic tricks and all this lame stuff to just try to entertain them, and it was fun [[01:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=6450.799999999999s)]
*  They thought it was great, and they thought I was funny so like little things like that [[01:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=6456.48s)]
*  It's where it all kind of started [[01:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=6461.38s)]
*  But yeah the dad notics the dad always trying to impress the dad thing was a big deal [[01:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=6463.639999999999s)]
*  I mean it is with anybody again to reference the Sopranos like and a reference everything you know it all goes back to like crazy [[01:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=6468.58s)]
*  Psychology from our very we are a product of our childhood so crazy in it totally and I mean it's so [[01:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=6476.14s)]

*  We are like a victim of like the story is written early on we're just playing out the script that our [[01:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=6487.98s)]
*  You wrote right that never thought about it like that yeah, I've never said that before I like that [[01:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=6494.780000000001s)]
*  It's like the psychology that she was written right in the first couple years now [[01:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=6499.660000000001s)]
*  We hear we are just following the yep [[01:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=6503.4800000000005s)]
*  Because I found out at a very early age that my dad [[01:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=6506.3s)]
*  My mom used to tell me that my dad was a truck driver [[01:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=6511.26s)]
*  I think it was or something like that I can't exactly remember that part [[01:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=6514.3s)]
*  but it was some job where he was traveling a lot and [[01:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=6517.780000000001s)]
*  One day on the school bus we went to pick up my buddy Jeff Lewis over on Coronado and [[01:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=6521.26s)]
*  I noticed a car that looked like my dad's [[01:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=6529.74s)]
*  Across the street in the driveway [[01:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=6533.74s)]
*  So it's only like three four five blocks from where I was raised and I look over and I memorized the license plate [[01:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=6535.58s)]
*  Maybe I wrote it down [[01:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=6542.22s)]
*  I don't know and then the next time he came to visit which was usually like once every couple weeks or so or maybe [[01:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=6543.14s)]
*  Once a month for you know half an hour [[01:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=6548.3s)]
*  Next time he came over I matched up the license plate to this you know to this Bronco that I saw every [[01:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=6551.66s)]
*  day when we were picking up Jeff Lewis and [[01:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=6558.54s)]
*  And [[01:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=6562.62s)]
*  I didn't even bring it up to him because I never wanted to I never wanted to like [[01:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=6564.38s)]
*  Start any trouble. I always wanted him to think I was cool [[01:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=6569.58s)]
*  Mmm, but I said to mom after he left that day [[01:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=6572.860000000001s)]
*  I go so I noticed that his car is always in a driveway across the street from [[01:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=6576.66s)]
*  Jeff Lewis's house on Coronado [[01:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=6584.22s)]
*  And she like looked like she had seen a ghost cuz he's like she's like oh my god this ten-year-old [[01:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=6586.26s)]
*  Just figured out that his dad lives right around the corner [[01:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=6591.139999999999s)]
*  So then once I realized it's such an early age that [[01:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=6595.46s)]
*  My dad was just a few blocks away every day the whole time and she sat me down and told me everything [[01:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=6598.62s)]
*  So all of a sudden I realized like my mom's kind of a liar and my dad is raising a whole different family [[01:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=6603.78s)]
*  Right so all of a sudden there's this fire inside where it's like I'm gonna get him to like me one day [[01:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=6611.62s)]
*  I'm gonna get him to know that I'm the cool kid right cut to two months ago [[01:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=6617.679999999999s)]

*  PPG paints arena where the penguins play where you know a bunch of crazy stuff happens [[01:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=6628.5s)]
*  only 50 minutes away from Youngstown, Ohio and him and his girlfriend came out and saw me and you know [[01:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=6633.42s)]

*  Yeah, I mean there's no I don't yeah, it's just crazy [[01:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=6646.26s)]
*  Especially being from Youngstown you just never think you're gonna see anybody in the middle of an arena that you know performing to a sold-out [[01:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=6649.22s)]
*  360 degree crowd floor filled all the way to the upper deck [[01:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbW57ncZ1t8&t=6657.7s)]
