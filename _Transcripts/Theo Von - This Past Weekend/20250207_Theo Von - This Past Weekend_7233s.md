*  Just by yourself and it's always a collective of people that's there [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRdfnkKZzHU&t=1636.76s)]
*  You know in your corner that's pretty, you know pre-eminating your highest self. So to me, I just always felt like yo I [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRdfnkKZzHU&t=1641.82s)]
*  Grew up in Liberty City. My dad was a great football player, but my dad endured a lot of adversity [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRdfnkKZzHU&t=1648.96s)]
*  Through his family, you know, I'm saying we're just growing up in the 40s with my grandma [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRdfnkKZzHU&t=1655.28s)]
*  I grew up having to work a job and my dad having to take sports for like a job early, you know [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRdfnkKZzHU&t=1659.04s)]
*  I'm saying right [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRdfnkKZzHU&t=1665.56s)]
*  So it was it even something you think he won because I feel like this and I wonder there's a lot of young black men [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRdfnkKZzHU&t=1665.88s)]
*  Right young black women that do sports that don't even really want to be doing them [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRdfnkKZzHU&t=1670.16s)]
*  But it's a means to an end because at some point it was kind of the only choice [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRdfnkKZzHU&t=1675.8400000000001s)]
*  I think there's more choices now [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRdfnkKZzHU&t=1680.04s)]
*  You know, and that's just my outsider judgment. I'm not saying that I know that but it seems like you do know that [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRdfnkKZzHU&t=1682.0800000000002s)]
*  That's a valid opportunity because think about it. You growing up in Liberty City, but we I'm growing up where it's like [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRdfnkKZzHU&t=1686.48s)]
*  Drug selling and dope dealers killings right in this neighborhood. Yeah guys [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRdfnkKZzHU&t=1692.64s)]

*  Like things where he's kind of fading in and out of consciousness [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRdfnkKZzHU&t=2997.04s)]
*  That's a part of being an artist [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRdfnkKZzHU&t=2999.04s)]

*  He's an artist but you just can't throw him to the side [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRdfnkKZzHU&t=3007.04s)]
*  Not every time he's doing something cool [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRdfnkKZzHU&t=3009.04s)]

*  He's like the Haiti King [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRdfnkKZzHU&t=3027.04s)]
*  I didn't even think of him as being Haitian [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRdfnkKZzHU&t=3029.04s)]
*  Is he Haitian? [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRdfnkKZzHU&t=3031.04s)]

*  Raise awareness so people know you know what's going on [[00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRdfnkKZzHU&t=3297.04s)]
*  We can't change the rules [[00:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRdfnkKZzHU&t=3299.04s)]

*  And who you are [[00:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRdfnkKZzHU&t=3341.04s)]
*  And if people misjudge you [[00:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRdfnkKZzHU&t=3343.04s)]
*  Then that's on them [[00:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRdfnkKZzHU&t=3345.04s)]
*  And that's why we raise awareness to bring people with that misjudgment [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRdfnkKZzHU&t=3347.04s)]
*  To make those people feel good [[00:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRdfnkKZzHU&t=3349.04s)]

*  Of course and if I was at home [[01:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRdfnkKZzHU&t=4549.04s)]
*  Probably would still be kind of the same way [[01:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRdfnkKZzHU&t=4551.04s)]
*  Exactly so I'm just wondering [[01:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRdfnkKZzHU&t=4553.04s)]

*  So you never got actually diagnosed though in CTE [[01:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRdfnkKZzHU&t=5141.04s)]
*  Nah man people can't even die [[01:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRdfnkKZzHU&t=5143.04s)]
*  I know CTE, that's why I started CTSPN [[01:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRdfnkKZzHU&t=5145.04s)]
*  To talk to people about [[01:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRdfnkKZzHU&t=5147.04s)]
*  Their traumas and how they deal with their traumas [[01:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRdfnkKZzHU&t=5149.04s)]
*  And cope with their traumas, overcoming adversity [[01:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRdfnkKZzHU&t=5151.04s)]
*  Because I feel like being a great [[01:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRdfnkKZzHU&t=5153.04s)]
*  Football player [[01:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRdfnkKZzHU&t=5155.04s)]
*  Being a great person in any form of life [[01:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRdfnkKZzHU&t=5157.04s)]
*  You had to endure a lot of adversity [[01:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRdfnkKZzHU&t=5159.04s)]
*  Tell me some of the things that you went through as a kid [[01:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRdfnkKZzHU&t=5161.04s)]
*  How you was raised, you told me one of your traumas [[01:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRdfnkKZzHU&t=5163.04s)]
*  You said man, I always feel like a connection [[01:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRdfnkKZzHU&t=5165.04s)]
*  With a black person [[01:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRdfnkKZzHU&t=5167.04s)]
*  That was probably a trauma because that's something [[01:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRdfnkKZzHU&t=5169.04s)]
*  As a kid you may have to hold it in [[01:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRdfnkKZzHU&t=5171.04s)]
*  I felt unseen, that's what I felt like, I felt like nobody saw me [[01:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRdfnkKZzHU&t=5173.04s)]
*  And so I think that that was something [[01:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRdfnkKZzHU&t=5175.04s)]
*  Sometimes I could [[01:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRdfnkKZzHU&t=5177.04s)]
*  When I would see how maybe black people [[01:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRdfnkKZzHU&t=5179.04s)]
*  Were looked at or treated sometimes [[01:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRdfnkKZzHU&t=5181.04s)]
*  Or some of just [[01:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRdfnkKZzHU&t=5183.04s)]
*  How they even treated themselves sometimes [[01:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRdfnkKZzHU&t=5185.04s)]
*  You know, I would like notice just [[01:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRdfnkKZzHU&t=5187.04s)]
*  Little things sometimes [[01:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRdfnkKZzHU&t=5189.04s)]
*  As I became an adult I could relate to little things [[01:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRdfnkKZzHU&t=5191.04s)]
*  I'm not saying I could relate to any of their [[01:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRdfnkKZzHU&t=5193.04s)]
*  History or anything like that, but I'm just saying there were [[01:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRdfnkKZzHU&t=5195.04s)]
*  Little things I could relate to like man [[01:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRdfnkKZzHU&t=5197.04s)]
*  Man, now I can see why I [[01:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRdfnkKZzHU&t=5199.04s)]
*  Gravitated towards some of these kids because [[01:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRdfnkKZzHU&t=5201.04s)]
*  I didn't feel seen, I didn't feel like anybody saw me [[01:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRdfnkKZzHU&t=5203.04s)]
*  I didn't feel, and if they did see me [[01:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRdfnkKZzHU&t=5205.04s)]
*  I felt like they thought I was fucking nothing [[01:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRdfnkKZzHU&t=5207.04s)]
*  And so there were little things like that [[01:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRdfnkKZzHU&t=5209.04s)]
*  Sometimes that I don't make [[01:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRdfnkKZzHU&t=5211.04s)]
*  Maybe could think about, I don't know, I'm not trying to make [[01:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRdfnkKZzHU&t=5213.04s)]
*  A black culture about me though [[01:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRdfnkKZzHU&t=5215.04s)]
*  But listen, but that's why I started CTSB [[01:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRdfnkKZzHU&t=5217.04s)]
*  So people could talk [[01:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRdfnkKZzHU&t=5219.04s)]
*  Through their traumas, cope with their traumas [[01:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRdfnkKZzHU&t=5221.04s)]
*  Understand how to deal with it because I had to learn [[01:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRdfnkKZzHU&t=5223.04s)]
*  How to deal with my traumas to put myself together [[01:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRdfnkKZzHU&t=5225.04s)]
*  And be able to be in a position [[01:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRdfnkKZzHU&t=5227.04s)]
*  I'm in, because that's a part of life [[01:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRdfnkKZzHU&t=5229.04s)]
*  Life's about how you overcome adversity [[01:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRdfnkKZzHU&t=5231.04s)]
*  How you deal with adversity [[01:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRdfnkKZzHU&t=5233.04s)]
*  And how you overcome [[01:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRdfnkKZzHU&t=5235.04s)]
*  Your situation, I'm sure you've been through a lot of your life [[01:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRdfnkKZzHU&t=5237.04s)]
*  And that's why I started CTSB [[01:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRdfnkKZzHU&t=5239.04s)]
*  And to show high level athletes [[01:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRdfnkKZzHU&t=5241.04s)]
*  And high level people what are the things [[01:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRdfnkKZzHU&t=5243.04s)]
*  That made them great, what are the things they had to go through [[01:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRdfnkKZzHU&t=5245.04s)]
*  Because we all went through some, you could have been raised with one parent [[01:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRdfnkKZzHU&t=5247.04s)]
*  Maybe you just never [[01:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRdfnkKZzHU&t=5249.04s)]
*  Seen your dad, maybe you were [[01:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRdfnkKZzHU&t=5251.04s)]
*  Just artistic, you liked the computer, you never played [[01:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRdfnkKZzHU&t=5253.04s)]
*  Outside, so you just [[01:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRdfnkKZzHU&t=5255.04s)]
*  It could be a false [[01:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRdfnkKZzHU&t=5257.04s)]
*  You may have been raised with a sick sibling, you may have been raised [[01:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRdfnkKZzHU&t=5259.04s)]
*  But everybody got some type of trauma [[01:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRdfnkKZzHU&t=5261.04s)]
*  They're facing, maybe you're not tall enough and you can't [[01:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRdfnkKZzHU&t=5263.04s)]
*  Pursue that dream you want, it could be any little thing [[01:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRdfnkKZzHU&t=5265.04s)]
*  As a human that we're facing [[01:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRdfnkKZzHU&t=5267.04s)]
*  And we are facing some trauma, so that's why I started [[01:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRdfnkKZzHU&t=5269.04s)]
*  CTSB and so I could talk to people [[01:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRdfnkKZzHU&t=5271.04s)]
*  From their traumas [[01:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRdfnkKZzHU&t=5273.04s)]
*  What's your adversity, how you overcome it [[01:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRdfnkKZzHU&t=5275.04s)]
*  What was the bridge point, okay [[01:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRdfnkKZzHU&t=5277.04s)]
*  How do you get through that, and people can see [[01:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRdfnkKZzHU&t=5279.04s)]
*  When they're watching the video of [[01:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRdfnkKZzHU&t=5281.04s)]
*  Okay, I'm talking to Theo Vaughn, okay [[01:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRdfnkKZzHU&t=5283.04s)]
*  How the fuck Theo Vaughn overcame [[01:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRdfnkKZzHU&t=5285.04s)]
*  That situation, like how did he get [[01:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRdfnkKZzHU&t=5287.04s)]
*  In that position, because I feel like [[01:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRdfnkKZzHU&t=5289.04s)]
*  Is it a weekly show, CTSB? [[01:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRdfnkKZzHU&t=5291.04s)]
*  Like I need to do more weekly, I feel like [[01:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRdfnkKZzHU&t=5293.04s)]
*  I just be usually [[01:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRdfnkKZzHU&t=5295.04s)]

*  About their traumas when I see [[01:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRdfnkKZzHU&t=5299.04s)]
*  You know what I mean, because sometimes it's a lot to talk [[01:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRdfnkKZzHU&t=5301.04s)]
*  To people about their traumas, because a lot of people hide [[01:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRdfnkKZzHU&t=5303.04s)]
*  Their traumas, you know what I mean [[01:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRdfnkKZzHU&t=5305.04s)]
*  A lot of people not like that, yeah you become ashamed of them [[01:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRdfnkKZzHU&t=5307.04s)]
*  Of course, but it's like we can't be ashamed [[01:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRdfnkKZzHU&t=5309.04s)]
*  Of the uncomfortable, because [[01:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRdfnkKZzHU&t=5311.04s)]
*  That's the only way we get better is to dress [[01:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRdfnkKZzHU&t=5313.04s)]
*  The uncomfortable, then the mental health [[01:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRdfnkKZzHU&t=5315.04s)]

*  From the moment like your friend [[01:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRdfnkKZzHU&t=5353.04s)]

*  In life, you know what I learned Theo, in life [[01:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRdfnkKZzHU&t=5365.04s)]
*  It's better to be happy than to be right [[01:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRdfnkKZzHU&t=5367.04s)]
*  You know what I mean? Sometimes [[01:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRdfnkKZzHU&t=5369.04s)]
*  People get so much trauma in their life [[01:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRdfnkKZzHU&t=5371.04s)]
*  They get so much trauma [[01:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRdfnkKZzHU&t=5373.04s)]
*  Like your friend has so much trauma for people [[01:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRdfnkKZzHU&t=5375.04s)]
*  People treating them wrong, treating them wrong [[01:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRdfnkKZzHU&t=5377.04s)]
*  He felt that it was the right thing to do probably [[01:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRdfnkKZzHU&t=5379.04s)]
*  To just do the wrong thing [[01:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRdfnkKZzHU&t=5381.04s)]
*  Oh, I'm sure, man [[01:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRdfnkKZzHU&t=5383.04s)]
*  Somehow I'm going to show you to fucking see me [[01:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRdfnkKZzHU&t=5385.04s)]
*  And if it's going to have to be a crime [[01:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRdfnkKZzHU&t=5387.04s)]
*  It's going to have to be whatever it needs to be [[01:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRdfnkKZzHU&t=5389.04s)]
*  You're going to be seeing me to get that look [[01:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRdfnkKZzHU&t=5391.04s)]
*  You're going to see me somehow, right? [[01:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRdfnkKZzHU&t=5393.04s)]
*  Exactly [[01:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRdfnkKZzHU&t=5395.04s)]
*  But that's the attitude they take [[01:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRdfnkKZzHU&t=5397.04s)]
*  As a human, you know what I mean? [[01:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRdfnkKZzHU&t=5399.04s)]
*  You take that on your own [[01:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRdfnkKZzHU&t=5401.04s)]
*  And it's like, yo bro, ask your friend out [[01:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRdfnkKZzHU&t=5403.04s)]
*  Is that really happiness? [[01:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRdfnkKZzHU&t=5405.04s)]
*  Sometimes though, the pain [[01:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRdfnkKZzHU&t=5407.04s)]
*  Somebody I believe is feeling [[01:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRdfnkKZzHU&t=5409.04s)]
*  Ain't even there, pain is from another generation [[01:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRdfnkKZzHU&t=5411.04s)]
*  So you have somebody [[01:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRdfnkKZzHU&t=5413.04s)]
*  Out here expressing a pain [[01:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRdfnkKZzHU&t=5415.04s)]
*  That's just been stuck in their DNA [[01:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRdfnkKZzHU&t=5417.04s)]
*  Because the DNA has to be even at the end of the line [[01:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRdfnkKZzHU&t=5419.04s)]
*  God made it all even [[01:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRdfnkKZzHU&t=5421.04s)]
*  So I believe it has to find a way [[01:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRdfnkKZzHU&t=5423.04s)]
*  To even out because nature is a pretty even lady [[01:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRdfnkKZzHU&t=5425.04s)]
*  And that's what about the large [[01:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRdfnkKZzHU&t=5427.04s)]
*  And therapy and CTSPA [[01:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRdfnkKZzHU&t=5429.04s)]

*  That's what I told you [[01:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRdfnkKZzHU&t=6453.04s)]
*  Here's what I believe in that [[01:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRdfnkKZzHU&t=6455.04s)]
*  I believe the CIA or the FBI [[01:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRdfnkKZzHU&t=6457.04s)]
*  Has gone through [[01:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRdfnkKZzHU&t=6459.04s)]
*  Probably marked stuff in there to make MLK [[01:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRdfnkKZzHU&t=6461.04s)]
*  Look bad right [[01:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRdfnkKZzHU&t=6463.04s)]
*  They want to bring him down [[01:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRdfnkKZzHU&t=6465.04s)]
*  Because here's what happens is [[01:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRdfnkKZzHU&t=6467.04s)]
*  First they give you leaders [[01:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRdfnkKZzHU&t=6469.04s)]
*  Then they start to release information [[01:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRdfnkKZzHU&t=6471.04s)]
*  That brings those leaders down [[01:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRdfnkKZzHU&t=6473.04s)]
*  And when they do that they kill a culture [[01:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRdfnkKZzHU&t=6475.04s)]
*  They kill a culture right [[01:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRdfnkKZzHU&t=6477.04s)]
*  So now all the people that had him as a [[01:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRdfnkKZzHU&t=6479.04s)]
*  Role model [[01:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRdfnkKZzHU&t=6481.04s)]
*  And a high level guy [[01:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRdfnkKZzHU&t=6483.04s)]
*  He may have had a unique life that was filled with different things [[01:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRdfnkKZzHU&t=6485.04s)]
*  But it didn't make him maybe a bad guy [[01:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRdfnkKZzHU&t=6487.04s)]
*  It just take away [[01:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRdfnkKZzHU&t=6489.04s)]
*  That's what I'm saying [[01:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRdfnkKZzHU&t=6491.04s)]
*  That's what America has been based on [[01:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRdfnkKZzHU&t=6493.04s)]
*  For black culture [[01:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRdfnkKZzHU&t=6495.04s)]
*  It happens now for white culture too [[01:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRdfnkKZzHU&t=6497.04s)]
*  I think it happens for all humans [[01:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRdfnkKZzHU&t=6499.04s)]
*  That's why we got to pre-eminate it [[01:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRdfnkKZzHU&t=6501.04s)]
*  Mostly for the blacks [[01:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRdfnkKZzHU&t=6503.04s)]
*  The black superheroes [[01:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRdfnkKZzHU&t=6505.04s)]
*  It's definitely happening more to blacks [[01:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRdfnkKZzHU&t=6507.04s)]
*  But now you're seeing where they're going and taking down [[01:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRdfnkKZzHU&t=6509.04s)]
*  The media can go and take [[01:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRdfnkKZzHU&t=6511.04s)]
*  Black leaders down [[01:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRdfnkKZzHU&t=6513.04s)]
*  That's all it is, is the media take down [[01:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRdfnkKZzHU&t=6515.04s)]
*  That's all it has been [[01:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRdfnkKZzHU&t=6517.04s)]
