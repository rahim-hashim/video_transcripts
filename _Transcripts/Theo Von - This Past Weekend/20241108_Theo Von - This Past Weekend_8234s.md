*  Um, i've been teaching psychology for 18 of those years. I actually just started a year ago as the dean of [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=195.32000000000002s)]
*  arts humanities and social sciences [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=202.44000000000003s)]
*  But most of that time i've been researching and actually even before that I was researching anger [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=204.92000000000002s)]
*  Uh in teaching and writing about anger and what made you get into it [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=210.04000000000002s)]
*  Did you have like some some things when you was a child that got you really angry? Yeah [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=213.64000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, some of it was that some of it, you know [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=217.8s)]
*  There's this long story about my family and what was called the martin temper, right and referred to mostly the men [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=219.64s)]
*  In my family who had who were like quick to quick to get mad. Oh, yeah [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=227.55999999999997s)]
*  starting with my dad [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=232.44s)]
*  But but not ending with him, right? And so both my brothers me [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=234.27999999999997s)]
*  um, and you know, so something I was just it's interesting because I think people assume [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=237.79999999999998s)]
*  um, you know anger is [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=242.44s)]
*  Um, uh, you know that like that it was like hostile or uncomfortable or that we didn't love each other professional wrestling or something [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=244.6s)]
*  Yes, exactly. But it wasn't that it was like it was a really loving home. Like I get along great with my siblings [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=251.32s)]
*  We've got really great relationships [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=257.24s)]
*  um [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=259.24s)]
*  All of us have have chilled out quite a bit since then [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=260.2s)]
*  Um, but so it's just something I I grew up with and when I was a teen [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=264.52s)]
*  Yeah [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=267.64s)]
*  and and when I went to college decided I was interested in studying it more and then [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=268.12s)]
*  Uh went to grad school and and started working with a professor who who studied it? [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=272.92s)]
*  um, his name is dr eric dollin and and he was researching anger and [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=277.16s)]
*  It just became something I was really passionate about really interested in [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=281.8s)]
*  So yeah, it seems like it was kind of a family affair then kind of and so obviously that's [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=285.16s)]
*  uh, maybe that's just a sign out of the gate that it's something for you to um, to [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=289.24s)]
*  Like reflect on and learn about you know, um [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=294.52s)]
*  Um [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=297.16s)]
*  So when people like because I get angry all the time [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=298.36s)]
*  I'm pretty angry a lot even though maybe sometimes I don't seem like it [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=300.68s)]
*  But when people say anger like what do they mean? Like what like I know it's so basic but like what is anger? [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=303.32000000000005s)]
*  Yep. Yeah, and so I I think what you just said is really really important [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=308.92s)]
*  Like, you know, you said i'm angry a lot of the time, but people don't [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=311.96000000000004s)]
*  realize it and I think that's because [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=315.56s)]
*  Um something I think you realize that a lot of people don't is that anger is just the feeling it's just the emotion [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=317.8s)]
*  We can express that motion that emotion in a gajillion different ways and some people [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=324.28000000000003s)]
*  Express that anger by yelling and screaming some people express that anger by suppressing it some people like me [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=329.96000000000004s)]
*  They they just do a relatively good job of controlling it of using it to problem solve and so on [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=336.6s)]
*  To answer your question. What is it? It's it's the emotional desire [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=342.36s)]
*  To lash out and it's associated with having been wronged [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=346.36s)]
*  Having been treated unfairly or having um had your goals blocked like I want to do something and [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=351.16s)]
*  Something's interfering with me trying to get that thing done. Right? So it's why it's why road rage is so common [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=359.72s)]
*  It's because by definition you're on your way somewhere [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=365.08000000000004s)]
*  Stuff's getting in your way and you start to get mad about it. Yeah [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=367.88s)]
*  What are your triggers like when you say you get angry all the time? What are some of the things that if I can ask? [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=371.72s)]
*  Yeah, no, thanks for asking ryan. I um [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=376.28000000000003s)]
*  For me i've been noticing recently a lot of it is unrealistic expectations [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=378.84s)]
*  So I have a lot of just generally unrealistic expectations that people should know how to do things the way I would like them [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=382.44s)]
*  To be done. Got it. Um, so that's that [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=389.15999999999997s)]
*  Out of the gate has been a big one for me. Would you describe yourself as um [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=392.59999999999997s)]
*  Like kind of type a do you know what that means like type a personality have you heard blood or whatever? [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=396.91999999999996s)]
*  No, no, no, um like a like it's a personality type of being competitive [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=401.23999999999995s)]
*  Um really aggressive a lot of successful people are type a i'm type a right and even um, it's like i'm really competitive [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=406.22s)]
*  i'm really aggressive i'm really [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=413.66s)]
*  Um type a let me see right here. We have it our personality is defined by traits like ambition drive and competitiveness [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=415.90000000000003s)]
*  Which can lead to a high level of success but type a personalities can also be impatient hostile and even have trouble relaxing [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=421.34000000000003s)]
*  Um, yeah, I wouldn't go to hostile. I don't get there but I can get like yeah [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=428.3s)]
*  very impatient [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=433.18s)]
*  Um have trouble relaxing dude i'll notice I will be urinating right and in the middle of urinating I will flush the toilet [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=434.94s)]
*  Just because I don't want to I want to get it off my checklist. Yeah [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=444.54s)]
*  It's like it's already done. You got a to-do list, right? Yeah, right [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=448.54s)]
*  So it's still weird because i'll then still urinate into the toilet [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=452.14s)]
*  Yeah, it's like i've already it's like yeah, but so impatience. Yeah is definitely a big one for me [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=455.02000000000004s)]
*  You got to learn to time that just right so that it's like just as you're finishing it's going down [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=459.82s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, i'm sure that's how I started but then after a while it was like well [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=464.46s)]
*  Why do I you know, but but I noticed that about myself like that's a real thing that I noticed that's like, um [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=467.9s)]
*  That for me was like wow, I have a lot of impatience [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=472.86s)]
*  You know, yeah [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=475.1s)]
*  when I think the reason I ask is because what you said about like setting unrealistic expectations is that's really common for [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=475.65999999999997s)]
*  People who are kind of type a right who have these hot this competitive trait is that they think hey [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=482.06s)]
*  the the [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=488.3s)]
*  People should I I want to accomplish a lot and me accomplishing a lot [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=489.42s)]
*  relies on other people to get their stuff done and and taken care of and if they don't if they let me down that [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=493.9s)]
*  Slows me down and I don't like it, right? And so it's it's um, this is something I actually deal with [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=501.42s)]
*  Relatively often too. I get an idea in my head that idea is reliant on other people doing their job in a particular way [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=507.48s)]
*  And I think to myself they should be able to get that done by whatever day, right? [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=514.62s)]
*  And then they don't you know and it in in fairness to them it's because they've got other stuff they're doing right? [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=519.9000000000001s)]
*  I mean, yeah, totally. Yeah, it makes sense that they don't or that things don't go a certain way [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=524.94s)]
*  It's just like in certain moments. It's tough for me, you know [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=529.26s)]
*  It's tough for me to notice that it's like that's not what i'm thinking [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=533.6600000000001s)]
*  Right, but that for sure is a big trigger for me. I notice is unrealistic expectations. Yeah [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=536.62s)]
*  So and i'm sure i'm not the only person that deals with this type of thing. Uh [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=542.38s)]
*  Yeah, so what why do people get mad like or get angry in in any given moment kind of like is it [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=546.46s)]
*  Is there a real science behind it? Yep, and this is the stuff I study. So, okay [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=553.1s)]
*  so why people get angry in a particular moment is [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=556.94s)]
*  um [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=560.94s)]
*  Usually a confluence of like three things right there. So so there's a trigger [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=561.82s)]
*  There's the thing that happened right and and I tend to I encourage people to be really specific about what that thing is, right? [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=565.34s)]
*  so [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=570.94s)]
*  driving down the street, um [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=571.9000000000001s)]
*  Yellow light in front of you you think you can make it car in front of you stops though, right? [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=574.62s)]
*  So now you've got to stop. Um, so that's the trigger, right? [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=578.22s)]
*  Then there is your mood at the time of that trigger. So are you stressed? Are you fatigued? Are you [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=581.66s)]
*  um [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=587.98s)]
*  Already angry about something. Are you anxious? Whatever, right? Are you are you too warm or too cold physically uncomfortable hungry? [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=588.9399999999999s)]
*  All those things make it more likely that you're going to respond with with anger in that moment [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=596.06s)]
*  and then there's um [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=601.8199999999999s)]
*  There's how you interpret that behavior and this is where those expectations come in, right? [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=603.9s)]
*  So do I interpret this a person as do I look at this and say oh this is going to ruin my day [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=608.4599999999999s)]
*  I'm now i'm going to be late to work. I'm not going to get done what I need to get done [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=614.9399999999999s)]
*  Do you interpret it as oh that idiot? Why did they slow down, right? [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=618.9399999999999s)]
*  And so do you label them in that sort of negative way? You totally could have made that man. Yeah [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=622.54s)]
*  You know, or do you interpret it as? [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=627.9s)]
*  Um, hey, it's gonna slow me down two minutes. I'll still get to work. Everything's gonna be okay, right? [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=630.22s)]
*  That third one sounds like the healthiest one. Yep, but i'll even go sometimes like this bastard [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=635.18s)]
*  Yep, left his house just to fucking strain me here. Yep. He's just here to ruin my life [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=640.06s)]
*  Like yeah, or i'll yeah sometimes they're a part of my brain will even go there. You know, um [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=645.42s)]
*  We have these thoughts [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=651.18s)]
*  There's like there are a couple specific types of thoughts that we have when we're faced with that kind of provocation [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=652.3s)]
*  Okay, and one of them is what you just described. It's it's this inflammatory labeling, right? [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=657.98s)]
*  So I label this guy as a bastard as an asshole. It's a loser. Whatever right another one is [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=662.7s)]
*  That demandingness that we talked about it's like, you know god, why can't they just do the job the way they're supposed to whatever? [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=670.3000000000001s)]
*  You know the what we call like making these dictatorial demands like things need to be done the way I want them when when I want them [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=677.6600000000001s)]
*  There's uh, what we call overgeneralizing so it's uh, I don't know if you ever say like god [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=685.18s)]
*  This always happens to me. It's you know, where you label things in that sort of super exaggerated way [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=690.0600000000001s)]
*  There's catastrophizing which is when you blow things out of proportion [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=697.82s)]
*  You say this is going to ruin my day my week my month my year, right? [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=701.9s)]
*  This is the my career is over now, right? This ruins everything christmas is done. Yep. Exactly. Right. Yep [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=706.14s)]
*  Um, and then there's uh, the last one is what we call [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=713.02s)]
*  Uh, misattributing causation, but it's where you you just blame the wrong people for things [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=716.28s)]
*  You know you you say or you decide they did it on purpose, right? [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=720.38s)]
*  What you were saying before about like this guy's just doing this to fuck with me, right? [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=723.5s)]
*  That's you're you're making assumptions about no, and I know you're not really making those assumptions [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=727.42s)]
*  But you're making assumptions about why they did a thing, right? Yeah [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=732.06s)]
*  Um and and blowing it out so [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=735.9s)]
*  all those things come together into like this recipe for why you get mad in a particular moment and then [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=738.46s)]
*  um [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=745.4200000000001s)]
*  Even separate from that is what we do when we're mad, right? And so for me, um [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=746.46s)]
*  Every now and then i'll like just have a moment where i'll like yell not at someone but just sort of at the heavens [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=752.5400000000001s)]
*  Um, I might you know [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=758.38s)]
*  Sometimes pound my fist on the table or something like that when i'm when i'm really mad a lot of times though [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=759.5s)]
*  Like i'll i'll sort of simmer inside a little bit. I'll get frustrated. I'll sort of take a [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=764.5400000000001s)]
*  We do this thing in my office. We've done it for a long time where when we're feeling frustrated we'll say [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=770.0600000000001s)]
*  Okay, let's let's start with an unproductive response [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=775.1s)]
*  Meaning let's just take a minute to vent for a second about how we hate this, right? [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=778.38s)]
*  We'll take like two minutes and then we'll stop and we'll say okay now let's problem solve [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=782.86s)]
*  What do we need to do? Right? How do we how do we work through this? Right? Let some of the pressure off. Yep [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=786.94s)]
*  Yeah, exactly [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=791.6600000000001s)]
*  Um when it comes to anger, um [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=793.1s)]
*  Are there different types? [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=795.98s)]
*  so like we kind of have looked at like a situation that and triggers of [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=797.98s)]
*  And then you end up angry, right? Right. Are there different types of anger? Like are there [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=803.74s)]
*  Yeah, I mean I think anger can come from a lot of different places and people can tend to express it in lots of different ways [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=809.74s)]
*  I tend to think of anger as existing on like a continuum [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=817.5s)]
*  Meaning, um, you know on one end you've got mild frustration like hey i'm leaving the house can't find my keys, right? [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=821.34s)]
*  It's irritating. I misplaced something [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=828.46s)]
*  It's a bummer. Yeah, my shoes don't fit that good right stuff like that [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=831.26s)]
*  And then there's more intense frustration that that comes from like hey [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=834.62s)]
*  I'm now i'm really starting to run late this dude that got in my way on the road or whatever right more intense [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=840.0600000000001s)]
*  all the way up to like extreme anger of [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=845.9s)]
*  I um [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=849.9s)]
*  You know when you see a politician do something that you just hate or when [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=852.78s)]
*  When you know your your spouse treats you badly or when your parents treat you badly or whatever a friend takes advantage of you like the real extreme [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=857.42s)]
*  cruel [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=864.78s)]
*  Terrible things right and it exists and so it's everything from like mild frustration to just being livid with rage [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=865.74s)]
*  Um that that whole spectrum so there's just kind of a spectrum of anger. It's like it's small amounts. There's larger [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=872.2199999999999s)]
*  There's things that are really intense. Yep [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=877.98s)]
*  um [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=879.98s)]
*  I guess in my next thought like [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=881.34s)]
*  Because anger gives me a sense sometimes it like an [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=883.82s)]
*  Illusionary sense that I have some control over what's going on. Yeah, that's but it but at the same time [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=887.96s)]
*  I feel out of control like [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=894.7s)]
*  um [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=897.1s)]
*  Because anger sometimes makes me want to take an action. So that makes me feel like i'm in control [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=897.9000000000001s)]
*  Yep, but then like i'll get so like just sometimes just blinded by being angry that it's like I know i'm out of control [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=902.14s)]
*  You know, yeah [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=908.6999999999999s)]
*  This is one of the things that so I don't know if you've ever had this experience [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=909.8199999999999s)]
*  But have you ever been so angry that you started to cry? Is that something you can think of? [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=912.78s)]
*  um [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=917.1s)]
*  Yeah, not as an adult but as a child. Yeah. Okay. Interesting. I've been sad [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=918.62s)]
*  It's so but that i've cried but not anger that i've cried [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=922.62s)]
*  So there are some people and I discovered this on social media like there are a lot of people who [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=925.42s)]
*  Sometimes when they get really angry, they'll still start to cry [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=930.5200000000001s)]
*  Like that's their sort of go-to expression and the interesting thing is the people i've talked to hate this about themselves [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=934.22s)]
*  They they they will tell me I can't stand it. It drives me crazy because i'm really mad [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=940.1400000000001s)]
*  And instead of like I just start I start to cry [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=945.82s)]
*  and [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=949.58s)]
*  I think a big part of what's going on there is a pretty intense feeling of of helplessness [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=950.46s)]
*  It's like not only am I being treated badly not only am I being treated unfairly and having my goals blocked [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=956.2199999999999s)]
*  But there's nothing I can do about it. I'm just stuck [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=963.3399999999999s)]
*  And that hurts, you know, and it it doesn't feel good. It feels scary [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=966.8599999999999s)]
*  and so [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=971.5799999999999s)]
*  I think for a lot of for a lot of people that [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=972.54s)]
*  hopelessness and helplessness [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=976.28s)]
*  Lands them in a place where they just start to tear up like it sort of dovetails with sadness in this very real way [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=979.02s)]
*  whereas [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=986.6999999999999s)]
*  um for people like me when i'm feeling particularly sort of helpless or hopeless [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=987.8199999999999s)]
*  And angry I tend to focus on okay. So where are the places where I can [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=993.5799999999999s)]
*  Make a difference where the places where I can take a little bit of power back, right and try and solve this problem [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=998.6999999999999s)]
*  Can I solve the whole big problem? Maybe not but maybe I can [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=1004.38s)]
*  Make a dent, you know and do what I can do and then and that at least gives me some some power to like let [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=1008.38s)]
*  Things go yeah, because that's the biggest thing is the anger is feels like it has to be let go [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=1014.46s)]
*  that's the thing about anger like other feeling like [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=1020.6999999999999s)]
*  You know anger it feels like you have to you know [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=1023.66s)]
*  Like happy i've never been so happy. I then like went and dressed up like a clown and ran out into the street, you know [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=1026.78s)]
*  Yeah, but i've been so angry that i'll kill i'll damn i'll kick a clown if it comes near, you know, like [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=1032.54s)]
*  so, you know, i've but you know, there's there's [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=1038.86s)]
*  Anger is the one that feels like it has to get out of your body. Yeah, you know [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=1042.14s)]
*  It's got that gremlin and it just literally feels like it needs to leave you somehow [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=1047.18s)]
*  Well, it's because it that's a really interesting thought and I think it's because I think you're right anger [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=1051.34s)]
*  tends to linger [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=1057.82s)]
*  In ways that other emotions don't necessarily linger. Yeah, dude in loiterers [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=1059.98s)]
*  Yeah [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=1064.46s)]
*  And it's interesting because because joy or happiness or excitement like that that tends to dissipate relatively quickly [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=1064.94s)]
*  More more quickly than I think people realize right those feelings don't last. Yeah [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=1071.66s)]
*  Um, oh the half life on joy. It's not very long probably right but anger [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=1075.9s)]
*  You can still like you'll go get in your car. You'll drive somewhere [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=1080.46s)]
*  You'll start chewing the bottom here [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=1083.74s)]
*  Like I didn't even know somehow I started chewing on my own teeth one time [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=1085.42s)]
*  I was like what is even you know, sometimes you can get so angry that you turn you turn into a chew toy for yourself [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=1088.94s)]
*  Almost yeah, you know like i've just gotten so agitated. Um [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=1094.3s)]
*  Yeah, what happens to anger if we don't process it and then how can you process it? [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=1099.18s)]
*  Like like what's a legitimate way to process it? That's yeah realistic. Well, can we start with some of the illegitimate ways? [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=1104.06s)]
*  Okay. Yeah, yeah, and I say that because that's good because it connects to something you just said which is [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=1110.86s)]
*  um, you know wanting [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=1116.46s)]
*  Because people want it out of their body, right? [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=1118.86s)]
*  And it feels like and so we've been literally for thousands of years people have been talking about [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=1120.9399999999998s)]
*  catharsis as a way of [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=1127.0s)]
*  Of ridding our body of anger and thinking of ourselves almost like pressure cookers [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=1129.58s)]
*  Like if we don't if we don't open up the valve and release this anger will blow up, right? [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=1134.9399999999998s)]
*  and so that's where a lot of these approaches like if you've ever heard of a rage room or like [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=1139.58s)]
*  You know people punch in a punching bag or or hit in the gym or things like that [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=1145.1799999999998s)]
*  That's where those approaches come from is this idea that we gotta we gotta let that out [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=1149.34s)]
*  and now here's the here's the thing and and people are gonna throw rocks when I say this but [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=1153.5s)]
*  All of the research that we have on catharsis tells us it doesn't work [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=1158.78s)]
*  It doesn't rage actions of getting it out physically that it doesn't work. It doesn't it feels good at the time [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=1163.58s)]
*  And so people think well because it feels good. It must be good for me. It must help [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=1169.5s)]
*  But what we find is is two things [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=1174.86s)]
*  First over time the people who use that as their mechanism stay angry and and get angrier over time [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=1177.34s)]
*  We also find that like right after like moments after they they did the study and this is like 50 years old, right? [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=1185.58s)]
*  So we've known for a long time. They did the study where they provoked people in the lab [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=1192.06s)]
*  Then they took half of them and they put them on a on a bicycle and said just [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=1197.1799999999998s)]
*  Ride the bike as fast as you can right exercise [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=1201.9799999999998s)]
*  The other the other half had to do this really ridiculous task where they were like [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=1204.46s)]
*  Threading coins with a needle or something like that something boring and tedious and then [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=1208.7s)]
*  Afterwards they they assessed to see how angry and aggressive they were [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=1213.8000000000002s)]
*  And the people who worked it out on the bike were way more aggressive than the people who who you know [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=1218.14s)]
*  Did the other task because that exercise? [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=1223.98s)]
*  It doesn't do it. It keeps [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=1227.18s)]
*  um, it keeps the angry thoughts at the surface it keeps the [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=1229.5800000000002s)]
*  The intensity going keeps your blood pressure going what you need to do when you're angry [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=1234.46s)]
*  Is to actually find ways to calm down and relax right? I need to take deep breaths [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=1238.94s)]
*  Stuff like that rage rooms don't do that. Um hitting a punching bag doesn't do that [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=1243.74s)]
*  Wow, and I guess you feel like it does because again anger is that act it's that [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=1248.7800000000002s)]
*  I mean it almost makes you act it's like [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=1254.6200000000001s)]
*  You know people do things in a fit of anger in a fit of rage. It's like [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=1258.0600000000002s)]
*  It it's like this energy that's it's almost like it's always leaving a diving board, you know [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=1262.22s)]
*  So to get that to that even it almost feels like inertia or whatever [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=1267.66s)]
*  so to get it to stop I think is [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=1271.26s)]
*  You know some of this kind of harrowing I feel like [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=1273.9s)]
*  um [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=1276.7s)]
*  Raid rooms invite people to engage with their anger, but do they actually work? Yeah, this is a study that came out [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=1277.9s)]
*  I can't see who wrote it marcus biddle. I don't know marcus [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=1283.1s)]
*  Rage rooms, um, they just had one for women that they opened up. I saw this did you yeah, it's uh [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=1286.38s)]
*  I think [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=1294.6200000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I think it's is it a rage room or do they take them out into the woods? [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=1296.06s)]
*  If they're taking them into the woods, i'm not getting involved [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=1299.66s)]
*  You know what i'm saying? Like look [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=1302.7s)]
*  That's it. I'll let look i'll let as many ladies they want just go ham inside of a [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=1304.7s)]
*  Bed bath and bodywork or whatever with a shovel. Yeah, i'll join them [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=1309.58s)]
*  But I but if we I don't think we need like bring anybody into the woods. Yeah, that's probably not a great [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=1313.5s)]
*  Can you see what's going on here? I just want to uh, I think there's like a new york times article or something [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=1320.3s)]
*  This is an article about rage women rage getting it out. Yep [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=1325.58s)]
*  Well, because sometimes my rage it will almost feels like it blinds me right, you know, it's like [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=1329.98s)]
*  It is so overcoming because if you don't [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=1335.98s)]
*  so if [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=1339.4199999999998s)]
*  So if somebody doesn't process [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=1340.78s)]
*  I mean, I think like probably truly the the worst thing people can do is that a cathartic expression is like breaking stuff [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=1342.8600000000001s)]
*  Exercising those are probably the the bad ways, right? [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=1349.72s)]
*  And I guess there's a it just feels like that because physically you're doing something. Yep. Like yeah, obviously i'm taking an action [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=1352.3s)]
*  Yep, there's an actual physical action then it feels like oh that should be helpful [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=1359.26s)]
*  and and it is what your body wants to do right because [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=1362.6200000000001s)]
*  I mean if if we define anger as the emotional desire to lash out [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=1366.14s)]
*  Well, then your body wants to lash out and so if you give it that, you know, it's going to feel good [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=1370.22s)]
*  That doesn't again that doesn't make it good for you. Right? We we could talk about this with other I mean, you know [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=1375.42s)]
*  I guess some other like bad ways to deal with your anger, but these are obvious to people is like [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=1380.54s)]
*  Doing drugs right overeating, you know, um, just calling a friend and screaming at them like like those things are are are bad for you [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=1385.98s)]
*  They're mean [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=1393.74s)]
*  Do they do they make you feel better sometimes in the moment they do for people right but that doesn't make it good for them [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=1395.58s)]
*  but sometimes I think it feels like [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=1402.06s)]
*  Doing one of those things is healthier [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=1404.78s)]
*  Than doing something physically dangerous. Yes. Yep. I think so [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=1407.4199999999998s)]
*  You know, I think you're you're right. Although I mean long term those things can be physically dangerous too for sure [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=1411.8999999999999s)]
*  But but yeah, um, right. Yeah in the moment. Yep. Yeah [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=1417.4199999999998s)]
*  Yeah, and that's the that's the worry actually is that [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=1421.1799999999998s)]
*  so what we find is that people who use like if [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=1425.26s)]
*  If their approach to dealing with anger is i'm gonna go punch this pillow, you know, i'm [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=1429.5s)]
*  Or i'm gonna go punch this punching bag. I'm gonna tear phone books in half or whatever. Yeah [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=1435.1s)]
*  What we find is that becomes it's it's like, you know [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=1440.9399999999998s)]
*  I have a I used to have a soccer coach who would say practice makes permanent [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=1443.74s)]
*  Right and it's like the way you practice something is how you'll do things in life [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=1447.1s)]
*  And if you practice your anger that way [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=1451.34s)]
*  Well, then someday when you're mad, you're not going to control yourself and you're gonna you're gonna hit someone you're gonna [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=1454.22s)]
*  You know, you're gonna punch someone you're gonna go after them. And so it ends up having those kinds of long-term harmful [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=1459.74s)]
*  consequences [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=1466.04s)]
*  damn, dude [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=1467.66s)]
*  God, I just people don't like to hear this by the way when I when I talk about this on and just [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=1469.58s)]
*  a couple weeks ago, I talked about this on on instagram and [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=1475.18s)]
*  wow, I mean [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=1478.7s)]
*  New research comes out of 150 plus studies. It's a [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=1480.06s)]
*  Article by a guy named dr. Brad buschman is a huge monster anger researcher an aggression researcher in the field [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=1484.06s)]
*  and he does this study and he looks at 154 studies over time approximately and [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=1490.78s)]
*  Finds that across all these studies [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=1496.54s)]
*  What does work is when you find ways to to relax to decrease arousal in the moment, right? [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=1499.02s)]
*  Grounding deep breaths all that stuff. What doesn't work is when you [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=1505.8999999999999s)]
*  uh [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=1512.3s)]
*  When you you raise arousal, right? You break stuff. Of course, I share this on instagram [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=1513.5s)]
*  Nobody wants to hear nobody wants to hear that. Yeah [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=1519.58s)]
*  Well, I think ira arouse is a great term too to use because that's what's going on [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=1521.6599999999999s)]
*  Right, you're at a heightened state of arousal, right and it feels like dangerous arousal [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=1525.98s)]
*  Right, but even then I could see maybe if you're going to work out or get it out that way [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=1531.4199999999998s)]
*  You're keeping the arousal at a high level right because you're keeping like um, at least something inside of you aroused [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=1534.78s)]
*  um [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=1540.3799999999999s)]
*  every now and then someone reaches out to me and asks if i'll um [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=1541.8999999999999s)]
*  Open a raid room. No if i'll support theirs like if i'll go and like do promote their oh, yeah [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=1545.4199999999998s)]
*  Raid room and I have to tell them no, like you obviously haven't paid attention to what I have to say [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=1551.1799999999998s)]
*  um [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=1556.3799999999999s)]
*  These places took abandoned warehouses and vacant offices and turned them into businesses made for organized chaos [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=1557.82s)]

*  um [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=1603.98s)]

*  Oh interesting and then they just went out of business completely and just turned into one bedroom apartments [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=1610.06s)]
*  I'd have like a trap door on them or whatever [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=1614.94s)]
*  um [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=1617.26s)]
*  Dude, I remember there used to be a place in la downtown [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=1618.3799999999999s)]
*  They'd have a couple it was like a vietnamese establishment [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=1621.5s)]
*  And you would put on like a dog bite suit and these guys would literally beat the smack out of you for like 80 bucks [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=1624.1399999999999s)]
*  For 15 or 20 minutes. Wow, my brother and I used to play that game when we were kids actually [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=1629.26s)]
*  Yeah, we would we really would we would we would play this game where we would pile up a bunch of like we we had [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=1633.58s)]
*  We were a sports family, right? [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=1639.1799999999998s)]
*  So we had like all sorts of gear we'd pile all this gear in the middle of the room and we'd draft items [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=1640.3s)]
*  Like we'd each take a thing and then you'd put it on and then we had these big plastic tinker toys [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=1645.26s)]
*  And we just beat the crap out of each other. Yeah, so it was great mate. Yeah, he's a lot older than me though [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=1649.98s)]
*  So I usually lost well, it sounds like he was it seems very unfair that he would do that [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=1654.4599999999998s)]
*  Yeah, if he's a lot older like how old like 12 years older just five. Oh, that's kind of fair [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=1658.78s)]
*  Even that's getting a little outside of the range of able to beat my brother age. Yeah agreed [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=1663.5s)]
*  You know tell him that we'll let him know. Yeah. Yeah, here's one right here the rage room. There we go [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=1668.5400000000002s)]
*  Oh somebody hit a uh [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=1674.46s)]
*  Oh [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=1677.9s)]
*  Maybe they did hit an ink toner. Yeah a toner cartridge. Oh, there's something that had a dangerous gas in it [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=1679.5800000000002s)]
*  They said nerve gas. Yep. That's what you do. Look, you gotta be careful. Yeah, you gotta be careful [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=1684.7s)]
*  Yeah, right. I guess it's I don't know if i've ever even been to one [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=1690.6200000000001s)]
*  I don't know if it was something that really excited me [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=1694.7800000000002s)]
*  Um, so what would be healthy ways to process anger? I mean some of them seem kind of obvious [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=1697.34s)]
*  They don't seem that much fun, right? [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=1702.78s)]
*  Yeah, no, that's true [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=1705.26s)]
*  You know, I think there's there's two ways of thinking about this like the first way is to think about okay [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=1706.62s)]
*  When I am angry, what do I do to deal with that anger? Right? And that's where that study [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=1711.34s)]
*  I was just telling you about 154 articles that essentially find you gotta you gotta find ways to deescalate, right? [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=1716.3s)]
*  So what are what are those different mechanisms and there are different ones for different people but it's it's the the deep breathing it's [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=1722.8600000000001s)]
*  mindful walking [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=1731.1000000000001s)]
*  Um, it is you go for a walk and you just think about your thoughts and try and relax you think about nature [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=1732.78s)]
*  You think about whatever's going on cool study just came out by the way that found that [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=1739.02s)]
*  college students who go for walks [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=1743.1000000000001s)]
*  Versus college students who go for walks and birdwatch that the birdwatching is actually better for their mental health [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=1746.14s)]
*  Than just going for walks really and and these kind of peep and tommy on nature. I feel [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=1752.7s)]
*  I mean, it's true. Yeah. No, you're right. It's it's voyeuristic. It's like look this bird's just trying to live its life [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=1758.94s)]
*  I know here I am. Yeah, look at this bird just feeding his children. You're sitting there just yeah [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=1763.98s)]
*  Googling in the windows. Yeah, it's kind of crazy. But yeah get out of that bird's business [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=1769.18s)]
*  Yeah, but I think what's happening is is that the it forces [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=1773.66s)]
*  People to get out of their head right and like and so it doesn't have to be birds if you want to if you want [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=1779.0200000000002s)]
*  To look at something else, right if you feel more comfortable leaving those birds be [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=1783.42s)]
*  You can look at you can just be like i'm gonna identify leaves. Okay [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=1787.1000000000001s)]
*  Like yeah, i'm just gonna absorb something out here [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=1791.18s)]
*  Yeah [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=1793.26s)]
*  And it's because then you're it gets you out of your head to look at the thing and focus on the thing [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=1793.74s)]
*  And so like those kinds of de-escalation approaches are are some of the best things to do [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=1798.7s)]
*  The truth is though there's there's like infinite things you can do with your anger [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=1804.62s)]
*  And so sometimes you know, you can you can channel it into problem solving you can say i'm gonna because ultimately what what anger gives you is energy [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=1807.82s)]
*  right, I mean it it it gives you energy to to [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=1815.58s)]
*  confront the injustice and so [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=1819.4199999999998s)]
*  you know if if you [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=1822.1399999999999s)]
*  Experience something that is truly unfair and you want to do something about it [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=1824.22s)]
*  Well, there's lots of things you can do right you can you can protest you can write letters to the editor [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=1828.7s)]
*  You can donate money you can you can you know join all these causes to try and solve those problems [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=1832.62s)]
*  Yeah, that's a really good healthy way to to deal with your anger [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=1837.82s)]
*  You can hire one of those planes to write something in the sky. Exactly. Yeah, exactly [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=1841.7399999999998s)]

*  So when you're scared, that's your brains one of your brain's ways of of saying hey, there's a there's a threat, right? [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=2098.78s)]
*  There's danger around when you're sad. It means you've lost something and it's your brain's way of telling you that [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=2105.1800000000003s)]
*  Anger is one of your brain's ways of telling you that someone's treating you badly that you've experienced this injustice and that [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=2111.3399999999997s)]
*  That you got to do something about it. And then when your fight or flight system kicks in [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=2117.2599999999998s)]
*  That's your brain's way of saying [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=2121.98s)]
*  um, like giving you the energy to to deal with that and so one of the best ways to to handle anger is to [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=2123.98s)]
*  Channel that energy into [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=2131.2599999999998s)]
*  Solving whatever that problem is right and positive. Yeah, it's yeah [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=2133.58s)]
*  I feel like but if you some of it could go [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=2137.5s)]
*  Because what if you tell someone like yeah, you should get into quilting or doing something that's progress, you know [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=2140.3s)]
*  And then they just quilt like a you know, uh advertisement for saw two or whatever because that's how angry they are [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=2144.7s)]
*  You know [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=2149.9s)]
*  Like that would be my biggest hit but I guess that would be like at least a nice piece of art then they could sell [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=2150.86s)]
*  Yeah, um [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=2156.06s)]
*  So yeah, I guess that does kind of make sense [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=2157.74s)]
*  I mean chan I mean, so I love the the saw two quilt idea. Uh makes me wonder if that exists but yeah, so [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=2160.3s)]
*  Yeah, um, but we should uh, but I mean channeling your anger into art is a is a thing people do right? [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=2167.5s)]
*  I mean, that's a good healthy way. I mean [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=2174.3s)]
*  poetry [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=2177.02s)]
*  Other forms of writing art. It's so hard though. Oh, yeah, it's so hard when I close my car door and i'm like [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=2178.46s)]
*  To then want to [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=2188.62s)]
*  Draw something right unless I just write how I feel and just show it to her like but it's so hard [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=2191.18s)]
*  Like I guess that's the thing. It's like how do you get? [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=2196.7799999999997s)]
*  Over that like how do you get over like convert one moment into another so that you can because that's really the key, huh? [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=2200.54s)]
*  Yep [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=2208.06s)]
*  well [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=2208.62s)]
*  and I think this is like what it what it takes to be and ultimately like what I want and why i'm on social media and [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=2209.18s)]
*  Why why I write things is because [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=2214.7s)]
*  I want people to have sort of a healthier relationship with their emotions and sometimes what that takes is [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=2217.8199999999997s)]
*  Like a de-escalation in the moment so that you can [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=2224.38s)]
*  Still hang on to the at least the thoughts of anger [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=2228.6200000000003s)]
*  In a way that is healthy that allows you to channel them into something positive [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=2232.3s)]
*  Right because the truth is like even those emails that i'm talking about [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=2236.46s)]
*  I couldn't write those if I was in such a fit of rage that I wasn't making any sense [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=2239.98s)]
*  Right, you've got to come down a little bit. Yeah, even to get correct punctuation [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=2244.2200000000003s)]
*  You have to be almost like at a four right at a nine. It's all caps. Yep [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=2247.6600000000003s)]
*  It is dangerous emojis that you can get off. You have a vpn [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=2253.18s)]
*  This is one of the the things that I think actually has made electronic communication [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=2257.42s)]
*  Kind of dangerous for people I I used to have a professor who when I was in college who said hey when when you get an exam [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=2262.46s)]
*  Back, I don't want you to come talk to me about it for 24 hours [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=2269.02s)]
*  So I just want you to calm like just take some time to think about it relax [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=2272.86s)]
*  You're you're emoting too strongly in that first 24 hours take some time [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=2276.86s)]
*  But now and that was easier to do back then because [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=2280.94s)]
*  You know, you weren't going to see him for a couple days [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=2284.14s)]
*  Anyways, you didn't have access to him the way you do now via email or whatever [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=2285.58s)]
*  Now, uh, you know, I think when people get mad [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=2290.7799999999997s)]
*  It's so easy to fire off a quick response to fire off an email to fire off a tweet or a text or whatever [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=2293.42s)]
*  Um that it people can do things when they're feeling [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=2300.06s)]
*  Most enraged or when they're feeling most upset. Yeah [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=2304.06s)]
*  Yeah, and then it's really made it almost tougher in person because you don't have like when you're talking to somebody [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=2307.58s)]
*  You can't just like set them down for two or three minutes while you think about your answer [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=2312.94s)]
*  Yep, and pee again or whatever you do. Yeah, um or get you a little you know, get you a little dessert or something, but um [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=2317.58s)]
*  yeah, that it's almost gets like [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=2325.42s)]
*  we want to communicate less in person in a way because [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=2327.9s)]
*  Online communication is kind of easier. Yeah, I think it is [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=2332.14s)]
*  I mean, I think I think it is for a couple reasons one is you do and it is in some good ways, right? [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=2335.66s)]
*  You have more time to think about what you want to say and that's probably a good thing [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=2340.94s)]
*  But it's also easier in some bad ways and that you don't really [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=2345.58s)]
*  Like right now you and I are talking to each other and everything i'm seeing I can see how you're responding to it in your face [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=2349.5s)]
*  Right, but if you and I were communicating over text, I have no idea [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=2354.38s)]
*  How what i'm saying is impacting you and so it's easier for me [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=2358.7000000000003s)]
*  It might be easier in that context to say something cruel or or hurtful or um, hopeful even yeah [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=2362.7s)]
*  You know because I don't have i'm not confronted with what it did to you when when you got the message [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=2370.7s)]
*  So wonder what that does to us as people over time, right when they're because it used to be like if you wanted to [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=2376.14s)]
*  Well, I guess you could write a letter [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=2383.34s)]
*  but [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=2386.06s)]
*  But it used yeah, you had to there was it used to be probably more often you had to do face to face, right? [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=2387.82s)]
*  More often. Yep [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=2393.6600000000003s)]
*  And so you had to get the real reactions you had to get the real feelings of what was going on [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=2395.26s)]
*  Whereas if you can just message it, it's still scary, but it's not [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=2401.42s)]
*  It doesn't it must affect us differently emotionally over time. I wonder if that's valuable or not. Is this making any sense? [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=2405.26s)]
*  Yeah, no, absolutely. I mean, I think I mean, I think what happens is a couple things one [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=2410.94s)]
*  It's it's we get out of practice, right? [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=2415.18s)]
*  I mean you get out of practice interacting with people and and it becomes really easy to forget [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=2417.2599999999998s)]
*  How what you're saying is is impacting them in a very real and meaningful way and how you may have hurt their feelings or or whatever [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=2423.98s)]
*  Yeah [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=2432.38s)]
*  What about some other options for like? [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=2433.8199999999997s)]
*  The healthy process and of anger. Well, so yeah [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=2437.3399999999997s)]
*  That's one of the things we didn't get to is is um, you can think about like what we've been talking about is how you handle [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=2440.14s)]
*  Your anger once you're feeling it. What we haven't talked about yet is how you can kind of create a life where you are [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=2445.58s)]
*  More where you're managing it better in advance, right? Meaning [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=2453.02s)]
*  Yeah, that's what I need. Yeah [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=2457.5s)]
*  So, you know if you think about that model I described before right you've got your your trigger [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=2459.1s)]
*  You've got your mood at the time of the trigger and you've got your interpretation. Well, [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=2464.7s)]
*  You can intervene in any of those places, right? So you can like [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=2468.7s)]
*  We don't have control of every trigger we experience, but there are some we invite into our lives, right? [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=2473.42s)]
*  Either on purpose or on accident tiffany or whoever you're thinking about or anybody specific it could be sure [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=2478.7s)]
*  I mean even even things like it the example I always use is like [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=2484.7s)]
*  So I I used to love scary movies when I was growing up. I loved them at a certain point [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=2488.94s)]
*  I realized you know what these are having a pretty negative effect on me, right? [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=2493.18s)]
*  I'm staying up too late afterwards. I'm getting scared whatever so I started watching them less often, right? [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=2496.54s)]
*  That's we can do that with provocations. We can say [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=2501.26s)]
*  I'm not going to watch the news as often as I used to i'm not going to watch sports as often as I used to [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=2505.7400000000002s)]
*  Because it's getting to me in ways that aren't good for me. Yeah, um, we can even say [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=2510.06s)]
*  You know, i'm going to change my commute up so that I don't find myself in traffic as often as I I once did [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=2514.78s)]
*  I don't know if that's possible in nashville, but right but even if it's longer it's like i'm still going to change it up [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=2521.26s)]
*  So i'm just not because the traffic that's a good point [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=2525.74s)]
*  Because sometimes though we will recognize the things that agitate us and still continue to do them. Yep. What is that called? [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=2529.3399999999997s)]
*  Yeah, I don't know if that has a name actually but um, but you know what i'm talking about [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=2536.3799999999997s)]
*  Yeah, no, I mean when people continue to sort of walk into those [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=2539.8199999999997s)]
*  Those situations that that leave them feeling frustrated. Yeah [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=2544.06s)]
*  It's like they you want the agitation like, you know, it's gonna bother you [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=2549.18s)]
*  So then you know, you're gonna be able to be angry your anger almost becomes an addiction in a way [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=2552.3799999999997s)]
*  One and the the worst thing that can happen there sometimes is sometimes we so anticipate [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=2556.94s)]
*  That a situation is going to go poorly. Oh, yeah that we actually bring it out of that situation [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=2562.7799999999997s)]
*  Like we approach, you know, we're going to thanksgiving dinner and we know our uncle is going to be racist or whatever [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=2567.98s)]
*  And so and so we go there and we end up sort of first of all [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=2573.66s)]
*  We're hostile to them in advance in a way that it actually brings out their hostility back to us [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=2578.7s)]
*  And then also we we sort of unintentionally like goat them into things [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=2584.94s)]
*  Yeah, and we bring it out even pass the black beans to them and then lose it on them for no reason or something [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=2588.86s)]
*  You know, right like and then it do and it's just like we're just waiting in our head [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=2593.5s)]
*  You know or we'll ask for the brown rice and they'll look at it a certain way and they just [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=2597.66s)]
*  They can't hand. Yeah, it's like and then it's almost like yeah [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=2602.7s)]
*  It's like a lot of times you set things up, you know how they're gonna be god. That's such an instance, man [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=2605.58s)]
*  What do you do in that instance? Because that's a huge one. I think well, I think it's it's about what I what I like to call like [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=2612.54s)]
*  Proactive emotion management, right? So it's it's saying okay. I'm anticipating that this situation is going to go badly [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=2618.84s)]
*  What are some things that I can do now to prevent it from going the way I think it could go right? [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=2625.9s)]
*  And so that might be hey, let's let's give people the benefit of the doubt, right? [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=2631.02s)]
*  That might be going into the situation and saying [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=2634.54s)]
*  You know, let's let's not assume that they're going to do and say the worst thing. Let's go into that situation [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=2637.82s)]
*  Maybe I minimize my contact with them. Yeah, it's thanksgiving [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=2644.62s)]
*  But I don't have to be in the same room with this person the entire night and I can I can minimize how often I talk [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=2647.98s)]
*  To them, maybe it's you and your your partner who you're at the event with [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=2653.1s)]
*  You have like a like a safe word, right? [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=2657.66s)]
*  When you're getting frustrated that that's some some signal that you can do to send them a message saying like hey [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=2659.66s)]
*  Get me out of this, right? I mean there's there's all these things we can do [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=2665.18s)]
*  It's just we have to be thoughtful about it in advance and I think a lot of times we're not thoughtful about it. Yeah [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=2668.8599999999997s)]
*  Yeah, I'll struggle. I know sometimes like if I know like sometimes I can cut myself off and I'd be like [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=2674.62s)]
*  Hey go introduce yourself in the beginning instead of keeping an air where it's like [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=2680.7s)]
*  You have something in your head [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=2685.5s)]
*  Because i'm in i'm in recovery and so i'll have a lot of things like i'll build a world in my head [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=2687.5s)]
*  That's not really going on in the world around me. Yep. And so [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=2692.06s)]
*  uh [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=2696.1400000000003s)]
*  So sometimes some of those things I can cut off like hey go and go say hey, how's things going? [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=2697.02s)]
*  That way you've already created the first space of communication. It's been cool. Everything is good [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=2700.94s)]
*  Then if they do say say something sometimes that you if you're expecting somebody to say a certain thing [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=2705.7400000000002s)]
*  It doesn't really land on you the same way. Yeah. Um [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=2710.46s)]
*  A lot of times for me it is i'll keep myself away from people if I know i'm [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=2713.82s)]
*  Agitated so some so that's one of the things I think you said of just being able to prepare a little bit [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=2719.32s)]
*  But then it's like sometimes it's like that isolation builds on my own agitation because i'm always just kind of in my own world [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=2724.94s)]
*  Process and stuff. Yeah, no, that's really interesting that like, you know [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=2730.6200000000003s)]
*  We often do sort of create this world that that may or may not be realistic and we assume [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=2735.6600000000003s)]
*  Um, you know people are going to be a certain way [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=2741.82s)]
*  They're going to do a certain thing or they're thinking like we do a lot of mind reading, you know [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=2744.0600000000004s)]
*  and we assume people think the way we think they think and [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=2748.0600000000004s)]
*  um, and then [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=2752.86s)]
*  Yeah, it's crazy. Isn't it? Yeah, and what you just said about going up and introducing yourself or saying hi or whatever. That's a [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=2754.2200000000003s)]
*  that's really interesting because what it does is it it [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=2759.9s)]
*  It gives you the opportunity to realize that what you're thinking isn't accurate [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=2763.9s)]
*  Yeah, it's funny you say that because yeah one thing one thing we have learned a lot in recovery is just like um [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=2767.1800000000003s)]
*  Not believe in our brain. Yeah that our perception of things is off. Yep, you know [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=2771.34s)]
*  I mean that's really important and it's like you want to trust yourself [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=2776.3s)]
*  But you also have to leave some room to say you know what? Hey my understanding of the situation could be wrong [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=2779.0200000000004s)]
*  Yeah, and and when I meet people [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=2784.6200000000003s)]
*  Um, i've gotta i've gotta let them I mean, yeah, I can go in and I can be cautious, right? [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=2787.26s)]
*  That's one thing but I shouldn't assume that my my understanding of them is a thousand percent accurate. Yeah [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=2792.0600000000004s)]
*  Yeah [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=2798.14s)]
*  Yeah, and the more I isolate and stuff the more that bad perception builds. Yep. That's what's fascinating to me [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=2799.34s)]
*  It's like it grows its own muscles. Yeah, and that is I think if there's a thing [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=2806.06s)]
*  That I find sort of most dangerous or worrisome about modern day [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=2811.5s)]
*  America or the world is the degree to which we are isolating ourselves [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=2816.46s)]
*  Especially from people that we might disagree with and the degree to which we're not having like real conversations with people [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=2821.9s)]
*  Um that where we can get an opportunity to learn how they think right we we make assumptions about [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=2829.58s)]
*  What other people are doing and saying and those and then we we react to those assumptions more than we react to what's actually happening [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=2836.62s)]
*  Yeah, it is interesting how much we've become kind of [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=2844.7000000000003s)]
*  puppetable by [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=2848.36s)]
*  Like I don't know if I just want to say mainstream media, but by um [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=2850.62s)]
*  Bigger stories maybe that we didn't write ourselves kind of yeah, you know [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=2856.14s)]
*  Well, and you know and when you when you think about what like the social media [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=2860.3s)]
*  Algorithms do and how we end up seeing [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=2864.52s)]
*  The content that we agree with more regularly we interact with people who think like us more regularly, right? We we just are seeing [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=2867.66s)]
*  That [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=2874.78s)]
*  We're connected and put that sort of in quotes but connected to more people than ever before but not [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=2875.9s)]
*  Really because one we're only seeing a very specific sliver of their lives and we're um [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=2881.82s)]
*  not having this [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=2890.0600000000004s)]
*  We're not necessarily engaging with people who are different from us very regularly [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=2892.78s)]
*  I mean, do you guys notice that we're any angrier now than we were in the past? [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=2896.38s)]
*  Yeah, this this is [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=2901.6600000000003s)]
*  I wish we could go back in time and like have a some sort of anger thermometer, right? [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=2903.58s)]
*  That could measure anger over time because this is the question that I think everybody wants to know the answer to is [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=2908.14s)]
*  Are we angrier now than we used to be? [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=2913.18s)]
*  And in so many ways it sure seems like we are right because we see tons of examples of it [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=2915.42s)]
*  We see so much rage [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=2921.58s)]
*  um [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=2923.58s)]
*  The the I think the parts that we don't have answers to is [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=2924.2999999999997s)]
*  One is is a lot of that rage just more visible now than it used to be right? [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=2928.78s)]
*  Are we seeing it more now because of social media, right? So we get we get more stuff captured on video than we ever did [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=2933.1800000000003s)]
*  Um, and that might be what's happening that those things were happening before we just didn't know [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=2939.82s)]
*  um, it could also be [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=2944.7000000000003s)]
*  um, you know that that particular expression styles have become normalized, right? So [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=2946.7000000000003s)]
*  yelling screaming those things are become like [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=2952.52s)]
*  Hostility those things are becoming more common. Yeah, and so maybe that anger was there but but those outward expressions are much more common now [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=2956.22s)]
*  I think there is some some reason to think we're angrier now than we used to be. I mean it [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=2964.3799999999997s)]
*  I mean, I think like we're [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=2970.06s)]
*  Social the stuff we just were saying about social media is definitely bringing out [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=2972.46s)]
*  I think the illusion I think there was used to be more of I think like tradition we had [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=2976.14s)]
*  It felt like there was more of a sense of togetherness. Maybe [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=2982.22s)]
*  um, I wonder if those things [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=2985.66s)]
*  Left people feeling more complete [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=2988.8599999999997s)]
*  or safer in their country, I do start to notice that there starts to feel a little bit of like [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=2991.98s)]
*  What could happen in 15 years as opposed to that was never a thought when I was a kid [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=2999.8199999999997s)]
*  It was always like [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=3003.98s)]
*  I feel like we're going to be okay here. Right? Um, so I wonder if some of that like just [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=3005.42s)]
*  Subconsciously starts to boil inside of you. Oh, I absolutely think so [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=3010.8399999999997s)]
*  I mean, I think you know one of the things we're dealing with and I think a lot of this is post-pandemic [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=3014.14s)]
*  But not just post-pandemic is you know, so anger dovetails pretty closely with anxiety, right? [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=3019.02s)]
*  That these two emotions are pretty similar. They actually feel pretty similar [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=3025.98s)]
*  physiologically [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=3030.04s)]
*  So there's a there's a lot of overlap there and I I think it's fair to say that americans are [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=3031.66s)]
*  And probably worldwide people are more anxious now about the future than they have been for a very long time, right? [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=3037.74s)]
*  Okay. Yeah, and that anxiety it comes from a place of uncertainty about um, you know safety and [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=3042.86s)]
*  financial security and [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=3051.9s)]
*  These things even having jobs. I mean as they say like ai is gonna every day here [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=3054.78s)]
*  I was gonna take your job, you know, and the guy's like i'm unemployed and they're like it'll take that job [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=3058.54s)]
*  You're like Jesus. I can't even be unemployed anymore [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=3063.7400000000002s)]
*  But I think there is a little bit of fear even somebody who's just sitting on their couch watching, you know eating fritos and is watching [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=3066.6200000000003s)]
*  uh [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=3073.1800000000003s)]
*  you know, uh [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=3074.38s)]
*  TV shows all day that they're even that job is going to be taken back. Well, i'm gonna lose this right? [[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=3075.7400000000002s)]
*  Yeah [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=3080.38s)]
*  I mean, I think that there is this all of this uncertainty [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=3080.86s)]
*  Is leading to people and because I think in some ways it part of what happens is it leads to some competitiveness? [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=3084.54s)]
*  It leads to like hey, look the pie is getting smaller that we all share [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=3090.1400000000003s)]
*  And i'm worried that i'm not gonna have enough right and i'm not gonna be able to make ends meet and all of that leads to [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=3094.78s)]
*  You know frustration with your your fellow humans [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=3102.54s)]
*  Oh, yeah, because your perspective is suddenly i've got to take care of myself [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=3106.2999999999997s)]
*  Instead of like we have to take care of each other exactly and that gets a little creepy [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=3110.14s)]
*  Um exactly what do we do with pervasive anger at society and ideology situation out of control? Uh [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=3114.38s)]
*  I think that's another thing that happened during uh [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=3122.06s)]
*  during the pandemic is that I think um [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=3125.66s)]
*  People I think a lot of people in the united states and probably globally really started to feel like they couldn't trust each other [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=3128.78s)]
*  Yeah, and and I think that happened in lots of ways, right? [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=3135.98s)]
*  It was sort of a sense of hey people people aren't gonna [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=3139.42s)]
*  They're more interested in themselves than they are in taking care of each other, right? [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=3143.26s)]
*  They won't you know do x y or z they won't wear masks. They won't open things up. They're not worried about my finances [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=3147.1000000000004s)]
*  They're not you know, they're they're only worried about their own thing [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=3153.1800000000003s)]
*  And I think that that scared people and and led to a lot of animosity [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=3157.1800000000003s)]
*  Amongst people when I think also people didn't know if their government cared anymore [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=3162.7000000000003s)]
*  Yep, which was even like a which was um, probably similar. Yeah in the sense that we're like [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=3167.42s)]
*  Can I trust my government? Can I trust like? [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=3173.34s)]
*  um [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=3176.86s)]
*  You know you see stories like [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=3178.94s)]
*  the [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=3181.42s)]
*  Uh opioid epidemic and you're like the fact that the family didn't even go to jail or face any time and the amount of [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=3182.86s)]
*  you know, uh [[00:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=3190.7000000000003s)]
*  The amount of pain that that caused so many families not to mention deaths, right? [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=3192.3s)]
*  But I think you know things like that it makes you start to question [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=3196.6200000000003s)]
*  So if you don't even think you know if you can I mean you can always kind of question your government [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=3200.38s)]
*  I think that that's safe and question [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=3203.9s)]
*  Society and what's going on. It's good to think um [[00:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=3205.96s)]
*  Curiously [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=3209.34s)]
*  But I feel like that was probably another thing that happened is people were like, I don't know [[00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=3210.54s)]
*  We every commercials about drugs like it's just like who can I? [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=3214.06s)]
*  Where can I get valid information and who can I trust? Yep, and [[00:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=3217.98s)]
*  It probably became scary [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=3222.7s)]
*  You like I have to start with myself. Yep, and and I think that that sort of uncertainty [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=3224.62s)]
*  leads to [[00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=3230.06s)]
*  feelings of frustration and leads to [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=3231.42s)]
*  And and you know [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=3234.14s)]
*  I think part of what happened too is that for some people they felt like well the answers here are obvious [[00:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=3235.2599999999998s)]
*  And so why don't other people see how obvious these answers are? [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=3240.14s)]
*  And and and I don't know that the answers were necessarily obvious [[00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=3243.74s)]
*  But but I think that people felt like why can't people just do [[00:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=3247.3399999999997s)]
*  Whatever and then we can get through this right and when other people can be during cove [[00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=3251.42s)]
*  Do you mean yeah during cove and then yeah, um, yeah, I think people and people had just also just real different views of it [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=3255.18s)]
*  It was like in california things were very locked down and then here [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=3261.5s)]
*  um things were more open. Yep, you know, and it was like [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=3264.86s)]
*  What's the best way to do this? [[00:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=3268.94s)]
*  It was hard to learn even I mean, you know [[00:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=3271.82s)]
*  I live in in green bay and we've got you know, there's the there's the green bay public schools and there's other public school districts [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=3275.18s)]
*  That are like connected but and they're all doing different things. And so there's a sense of well here we're doing this [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=3281.74s)]
*  Five miles away. They're doing something different [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=3288.7s)]
*  Why you know what what's going on? [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=3291.18s)]
*  and so then there's an anger and frustration amongst the people who live in those communities and then people saying well [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=3293.18s)]
*  I'm gonna take my kids and send them to that school because they're doing this or i'm gonna you know [[00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=3297.74s)]
*  and so all of these things started to [[00:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=3301.2599999999998s)]
*  To bubble up and lead to frustration. Yeah, a lot of frustration [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=3304.22s)]
*  Yeah, and a really I know how to do it people wanted to yeah [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=3307.8199999999997s)]
*  the second you don't trust you or believe that your society that's built kind of has a [[00:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=3311.5s)]
*  Is looking out for you [[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=3316.3799999999997s)]
*  Or you can trust it that it really the you got to go back to yourself [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=3318.38s)]
*  Well, and then I mean imagine if it if we're not talking about society [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=3322.3s)]
*  We're just talking about a family right and what and you as like a kid in a family [[00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=3325.1800000000003s)]
*  Realize wow the other people in this family aren't necessarily going to do the things that are best for me [[00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=3331.88s)]
*  Right it becomes real hard to to continue to feel good about that and over time, right? [[00:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=3337.58s)]
*  People have to earn that trust back and I think we're right now in a phase where people haven't [[00:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=3343.42s)]
*  Where people don't feel like anyone's earning that trust back. They're just like we still don't trust each other [[00:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=3349.3399999999997s)]
*  They don't have my best interests in mind. They don't care about the same things as me. What am I gonna do? [[00:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=3353.8199999999997s)]
*  Um, how are we gonna get through this and I don't think anybody's got any answers to that. Yeah [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=3358.38s)]
*  Yeah, I wonder if it's one of those things it just takes time or [[00:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=3363.1s)]
*  I mean, that's always the thing. Yeah, I think you're right. I mean, I think I think time is going to be part of it [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=3366.46s)]
*  Um, I hope that I hope that there are things we can rally around. Um, [[00:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=3371.7400000000002s)]
*  Humor is usually a good one. Yeah, absolutely [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=3378.06s)]
*  I know they're trying to put out like I mean you would say that you're a comedian. That's probably true [[00:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=3381.26s)]
*  I would hope to say it. Yeah, they just put out they just had a new show tires on netflix, which is really crazy [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=3385.34s)]
*  Uh, i've seen an ad for it. I haven't watched it yet. It's like different than a lot of stuff they put on there [[00:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=3391.5s)]
*  it's just like it seems like it's from like [[00:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=3395.58s)]
*  Totally like the 80s or something, you know, it's just kind of like [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=3398.14s)]
*  just humor without like judging that every [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=3401.58s)]
*  person in the [[00:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=3405.02s)]
*  in the show has to [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=3406.7799999999997s)]
*  have certain like [[00:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=3409.42s)]
*  like [[00:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=3411.8199999999997s)]
*  You're just letting people be they could be characters like you could have a character you're like, oh that guy's hilarious [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=3413.02s)]
*  But I don't agree with them. Okay, whereas to be like, oh that guy [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=3417.5s)]
*  I'm not even to see if he is hilarious because I don't agree with the character, right? And it's like dude [[00:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=3421.42s)]
*  It's okay, you know, so like just things being more [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=3426.86s)]
*  possible or just open their brains to like okay a character [[00:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=3431.26s)]
*  Could believe differently than I do right? Yep, right because I think for a while it's been like I don't even want my characters [[00:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=3436.06s)]
*  Right to have any different views and I do that's kind of crazy. Yeah, when you think about that [[00:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=3443.5s)]
*  Yeah, I mean like I'm drowning but I only want a superhero to show up [[00:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=3449.34s)]
*  If he feels exactly the same way I do. Yeah [[00:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=3453.82s)]
*  when it's tough, I mean like, you know [[00:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=3456.86s)]
*  I think one of the tricky things we've had to deal with is that there are I mean [[00:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=3459.98s)]
*  There are opinions that we people can like sort of [[00:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=3465.7400000000002s)]
*  Rally around their opinions that people can [[00:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=3469.02s)]
*  Like disagree with and [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=3472.86s)]
*  In an understandable reasonable way, right reasonable disagreements, but then so often those disagreements [[00:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=3475.6600000000003s)]
*  Are are about like real [[00:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=3482.2200000000003s)]
*  Scary stuff. It's not it's not me disagreeing about like hey is cats a good movie [[00:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=3484.3799999999997s)]
*  I don't know why I picked cats. I think it's because my son loved the movie cats. Oh he did [[00:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=3489.8999999999996s)]
*  I haven't seen I don't think okay. I'm not gonna recommend it. Okay. Yeah [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=3493.2599999999998s)]
*  That's that's my advice to you. That's if you walk away with one thing [[00:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=3498.7799999999997s)]
*  From this episode is that you probably shouldn't see cats [[00:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=3503.18s)]
*  Fair. Yeah. So yeah [[00:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=3506.7s)]
*  um [[00:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=3509.2599999999998s)]
*  I mean, so it's one thing to like disagree about that, right? [[00:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=3510.86s)]
*  um, totally different if we're talking about things that like really do have a [[00:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=3514.38s)]
*  Like have real consequences for people for sure, you know, like there's [[00:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=3521.26s)]
*  There are some opinions that we can just agree to disagree and then there's other stuff that is like no this is [[00:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=3525.26s)]
*  Like this is real personal. Yeah. Yeah [[00:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=3531.02s)]
*  Yeah, we didn't used to be wouldn't used to care about it that much though. Yeah, they did I think [[00:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=3534.86s)]
*  It is interesting how much like people used to never talk about politics how much you would kind of say maybe who you were gonna vote for [[00:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=3539.42s)]
*  And kind of sometimes you give a couple lines about it, but you never I feel like would be like [[00:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=3545.42s)]
*  Oh screw you for voting for that. Like it would never even the thought would never come into your head. I feel like [[00:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=3551.1000000000004s)]
*  Yeah, it does feel like it's taken center stage and I wonder how much of that is is I mean, it's probably [[00:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=3557.0200000000004s)]
*  A lot of it is exacerbated by social media [[00:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=3563.5800000000004s)]
*  I suspect the 24-hour news cycle also led to that too, right? [[00:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=3566.06s)]
*  That ruined a lot of stuff that created a lot of anger [[00:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=3569.2599999999998s)]
*  Yeah, yep, I mean I used to be able to take a day off half the day off. Yep [[00:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=3571.18s)]
*  But now they're like, oh you need a little more anger. Yeah one intentionally [[00:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=3575.58s)]
*  So I mean it's like so there's there's plenty of research out there that says that you know [[00:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=3579.58s)]
*  Content news or anything else that makes people angry or scared is far more luckily to go viral [[00:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=3585.74s)]
*  Than than other stuff right and so some politicians know that and just purely from a from a financial perspective [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=3592.62s)]
*  If you put an ad out that makes people mad it's going to get more clicks [[01:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=3601.2599999999998s)]
*  It's going to get I mean it you double the value essentially of that ad [[01:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=3605.42s)]
*  By making people mad with it, right? Yeah, so there are people who are [[01:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=3609.98s)]
*  Benefiting financially from our rage and that's not just true with politicians. That's true with with you know [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=3614.22s)]
*  Fox news CNN, etc. They want to make people mad. Yeah going yeah instead of just having an article though [[01:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=3621.18s)]
*  They'll reframe the title so it has an enemy. Yeah. Yep. That's pretty crazy dealing with anxiety and stress in the age of 24 7 news cycle [[01:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=3626.8599999999997s)]
*  Interesting. Let me see whether it's the coronavirus political divisiveness threats of terrorism or mass shootings [[01:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=3635.1s)]
*  You might not be immediately affected by these issues but constant exposure to the 24-hour news and social media [[01:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=3641.4199999999996s)]
*  Which is often heavily skewed towards the negative can adversely influence your mental health and overall well-being [[01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=3646.94s)]
*  More than 70 percent of americans believe the media blows things out of proportion which may seem harmless [[01:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=3652.2999999999997s)]
*  But it could lead to increased stress and anxiety [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=3656.2999999999997s)]
*  Wow, so but the tough tough part is if we're addicted to it though, right? [[01:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=3659.1s)]
*  Yep, that's the tough part is that we're if we're addicted to it [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=3664.62s)]
*  Yeah, I mean that's because I mean, you know people are drawn to this thing that ultimately [[01:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=3668.06s)]
*  Causes them harm right, you know, and what is that? Is that always been? [[01:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=3673.6600000000003s)]
*  I mean, has it just been since the apple in the garden of eden, you know, I mean [[01:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=3678.1400000000003s)]
*  Information is I mean people crave information, right? [[01:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=3683.7200000000003s)]
*  I mean that's an emotion another emotion that I like to talk about sometimes is curiosity, right and people people do crave information [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=3686.94s)]
*  It makes them feel good about themselves, especially if they can share it with other people. It's like a form of social currency [[01:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=3693.82s)]
*  And so and so knowing things is you know better than not knowing things and so people are drawn to to media [[01:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=3699.74s)]
*  And then when that media makes them mad [[01:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=3707.5s)]
*  they're more likely actually to share it with other people they're more likely because [[01:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=3709.8199999999997s)]
*  It it gets the reaction they want right? [[01:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=3713.8999999999996s)]
*  So if I came in here and told you just some sort of arbitrary fact you'd be like, that's great [[01:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=3716.8599999999997s)]
*  But if I came in here and told you something that made you really mad now i'm getting a reaction [[01:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=3721.4199999999996s)]
*  I'd be like what the heck? Yeah, what are we gonna do about it? Exactly. It's pretty crazy. Then we problem solve [[01:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=3725.9799999999996s)]
*  So we've really just we've kind of like death hacked ourselves in a way like there's life hacks [[01:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=3731.74s)]
*  And then I feel like there's death hacks and I feel like sometimes the algorithm does that you know, or um [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=3736.22s)]
*  The possibility to always have it at your fingertips because i'll find if i'd rather just chill or meditate or if i'd rather go [[01:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=3742.06s)]
*  Find something to make me angry. Mm-hmm [[01:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=3748.2999999999997s)]
*  Sometimes would like to find something to make me angry. Yeah, I get that yeah [[01:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=3751.02s)]
*  Because I mean it does I think for some people that anger feels [[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=3754.94s)]
*  Uh powerful, right? I mean, it's like there's a sense and we talked earlier about it sometimes feeling helpless [[01:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=3759.02s)]
*  But there's a there's a there's a piece of like the the heart rate increase the the blood pressure increase the muscle tension [[01:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=3764.2200000000003s)]
*  That leads to these feelings of of [[01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=3770.86s)]
*  Excitement. Yeah. Um, yeah, well, it feels like it activates you. Yep [[01:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=3774.28s)]
*  Exactly. Is there a such thing as like a healthy anger and then what is the difference between like a healthy anger and a rage? [[01:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=3777.7400000000002s)]
*  Yeah, is that noticeable? Yeah [[01:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=3784.1400000000003s)]
*  So what I would say is that when it comes to anger, I I tend to think of all emotions is not having [[01:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=3786.1400000000003s)]
*  Um, they aren't positive or negative on their own. They're just information systems, right? Um, and it's good to feel things [[01:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=3792.86s)]
*  In fact, if I had a wish for people it would be that they felt the whole sort of range of emotions, right? [[01:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=3800.2200000000003s)]
*  That that's what would be good for them. But in a nuanced way meaning [[01:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=3806.06s)]
*  That they could evaluate whether or not this thing is that they're feeling is good for them or bad for them in in a particular context [[01:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=3810.14s)]
*  So when I think about healthy versus unhealthy anger a big piece of it is what is it doing for me or to me? [[01:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=3818.3s)]
*  Right. So am I [[01:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=3825.58s)]
*  What kind of consequences am I experiencing? For some people those consequences can be physical, right? [[01:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=3827.26s)]
*  They can have like heart problems or muscle tension or chronic headaches or things like that [[01:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=3832.38s)]
*  Um for some people, um, those consequences are like relationships they get in a lot of verbal and physical fights [[01:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=3838.2999999999997s)]
*  um online fights for some people those consequences are um [[01:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=3845.66s)]
*  Property damage they break stuff. Um, oh, yes steel stuff. Yep [[01:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=3850.62s)]
*  Um, so I mean sometimes though, it's like other negative emotions [[01:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=3854.8599999999997s)]
*  It's like I get mad and then afterwards I feel guilty about something I said and so I feel real sad later [[01:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=3858.2999999999997s)]
*  Or I get scared that you know, my my partner's gonna leave me or or i'm gonna get in trouble [[01:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=3863.8199999999997s)]
*  Um, and so they have these other negative emotions talk about people like that's me. I'll get upset and then I will [[01:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=3869.5s)]
*  I'll apologize quickly usually but when I get into moments of really being really upset, it's hard for me to manage myself [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=3875.74s)]
*  Yeah, and then do you end up feeling sort of like guilty about it? Yeah, I feel remorseful [[01:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=3882.7s)]
*  I'm usually good at being able to apologize pretty quickly. That's good being able to notice my space in it [[01:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=3887.1s)]
*  but [[01:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=3892.4599999999996s)]
*  But the fact that it happens at all, you know is like [[01:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=3894.14s)]
*  Is something that has been uncomfortable for me. I think yeah [[01:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=3898.22s)]
*  Um, and I appreciate you saying that I didn't mean to interrupt you there. No, that's all right. Um, yeah, I think that's you know [[01:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=3902.22s)]
*  Connects to like for a lot of people their anger leads to things like substance abuse it leads to overeating it leads to [[01:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=3909.74s)]
*  Um, even I mean, you know substance abuse defined broadly like alcohol nicotine included, right? [[01:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=3916.46s)]
*  People people find ways of coping [[01:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=3921.1s)]
*  With their anger because they don't have better ways and so they end up turning to to drugs or alcohol [[01:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=3924.46s)]
*  Oh, yeah, and you know and that's uh [[01:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=3930.46s)]
*  That you know that ends up having consequences. It's yeah [[01:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=3933.58s)]
*  Was there more you want to say? Sorry. No, it's I mean, I think that sort of covers it [[01:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=3938.14s)]
*  But I think I think the big thing is there are lots and lots of consequences to unhealthy anger, right? [[01:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=3941.74s)]
*  There's also lots of good things we can do with it, right? [[01:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=3948.14s)]
*  There's lots of ways that we can we can turn our anger into those positive ways [[01:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=3950.14s)]
*  And so when when back to when people think about okay, what how is what's the impact of this on me? [[01:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=3954.62s)]
*  Um and on those people around me is to really sort of evaluate what what the outcome is [[01:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=3961.1800000000003s)]
*  Right. So if you can take a moment to evaluate what the outcome is going to be like what's going to happen right now [[01:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=3967.58s)]
*  I'm upset. So if I act on it then i'm gonna have to apologize later. I'm going to be [[01:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=3971.1800000000003s)]
*  Probably then i'm going to be bummed out at myself. Yep [[01:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=3977.1s)]
*  So now right now i'm upset at somebody else and maybe even at myself and then later i'm going to be [[01:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=3980.14s)]
*  Up to apologize somebody and probably [[01:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=3984.94s)]
*  Then be a little bit disheartened in myself for my actions. Yeah, so it's like what do I really want thing or do I just want things to [[01:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=3988.78s)]
*  Kind of be chill see I love what you're saying right now because [[01:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=3996.14s)]
*  to me one of the one of the best lessons people can learn about anger or any emotion is [[01:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=3999.82s)]
*  When i'm feeling it I need to stop for a second and think about what my goals are [[01:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=4006.0600000000004s)]
*  What's the thing that where do I want to this situation? [[01:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=4010.6200000000003s)]
*  to end right and [[01:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=4014.2200000000003s)]
*  Sometimes that is like, you know if I get mad on my my way to work [[01:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=4016.28s)]
*  Uh because somebody cut me off right now I could I could [[01:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=4021.5800000000004s)]
*  Drive them off the road and get in a fight with them [[01:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=4025.5s)]
*  But does that get me to work on time right in the way I want like my goal is to get to my destination safely [[01:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=4027.42s)]
*  Um [[01:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=4032.94s)]
*  And and so I should focus on that and anything else that I try and do in that moment [[01:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=4033.98s)]
*  Doesn't serve me. Yeah, you know, and I mean I use an exaggerated example [[01:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=4039.42s)]
*  But even giving them the finger or honking at them all those things just serve to distract me from my actual goal [[01:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=4043.1s)]
*  Yeah, and and we can think about that in a gajillion different other places, right? [[01:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=4048.46s)]
*  If i'm if I get you know, if I scroll through social media and I see a post that bugs me [[01:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=4052.78s)]
*  Yeah, I can I can fight back or I can argue or whatever or I can think about [[01:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=4059.58s)]
*  What do I why am I here? Why am I in this space? [[01:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=4064.38s)]
*  What's what is the point of arguing maybe there's maybe there's a good reason to um, and and I should [[01:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=4067.34s)]
*  Or maybe there's a good reason for me to scroll on and not care [[01:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=4072.86s)]
*  Yeah, I was just thinking when you said that the social media definitely kind of it almost deflates our anger in some ways [[01:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=4076.46s)]
*  Because instead of a lot of times it used to be maybe if enough people got angry about something they would go protest [[01:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=4082.54s)]
*  They would make a difference. They would boycott. They would not use a product or they would stand up [[01:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=4088.3799999999997s)]
*  but now it almost feels like you can comment into [[01:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=4093.58s)]
*  Almost a vacuum because of how quick things disappear. Yep, and you can just say well I comment it or I say, you know [[01:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=4097.42s)]
*  I did something right I did something but then it kind of like just satiates enough [[01:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=4103.42s)]
*  Yep, the human desire to do something where we don't end up doing things and then we as a group [[01:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=4108.139999999999s)]
*  Get kind of further and further into this crevasse [[01:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=4114.219999999999s)]
*  I think that is a real problem. I think you're absolutely I do I think you're absolutely right that that a big [[01:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=4116.86s)]
*  A big part of what happens is some there's the social media [[01:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=4123.34s)]
*  I don't want to minimize social media activism because there are forms of it that are really powerful and really meaningful [[01:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=4127.18s)]
*  But but there are also forms of it that are that don't do much, right? [[01:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=4132.14s)]
*  And but they they I think you use the word satiate right? [[01:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=4135.74s)]
*  They give you a sense of like I did something and because I did something I can now rest right? [[01:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=4138.7s)]
*  I I I had my impact right I had my human impact, but it's not sometimes it's [[01:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=4144.7s)]
*  And it changes so much [[01:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=4150.38s)]
*  Right. Um, it changes so much whereas like every day there's a new option almost. Yep [[01:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=4152.3s)]
*  So the thing you impacted is just they've almost just replaced it with something new [[01:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=4158.14s)]
*  Yep, and and there's a new thing to be mad about too. Right? You've got a new I've got a new [[01:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=4162.46s)]
*  Both outlet but also, you know thing to focus on. Yeah right along. Yep [[01:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=4168.54s)]
*  Here's an article that was in the atlantic the problem with social media protests [[01:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=4173.099999999999s)]
*  Before the internet changes speed at which the world moves movements were slower growing a year of organizing and directly advocating for change led to a [[01:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=4178.7s)]
*  13th month long montgomery bus boycott that began with rosa park's act of resistance [[01:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=4185.16s)]
*  um [[01:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=4190.54s)]
*  Right. That's what it used to be like [[01:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=4191.5s)]
*  uh [[01:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=4193.5s)]
*  By contrast mass protests such as occupy wall street formed rapidly but then lacking that underlying resilience created over time [[01:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=4194.94s)]
*  Often lost focus direction and most important their potential to affect change [[01:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=4202.620000000001s)]
*  Interesting. So in some ways it feels like what what they're saying is [[01:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=4208.200000000001s)]
*  When you when you put a lot of work into something in advance [[01:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=4212.3s)]
*  Then you want to see it through in ways that social media protests don't have that right? [[01:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=4215.02s)]
*  It's like, you know, i've been thinking about this for a week. So I don't need to keep thinking about I mean [[01:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=4219.42s)]
*  I don't have as much sunk into this. No, and if I close the app, i'm not even an activist anymore [[01:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=4223.9800000000005s)]
*  Right, right interesting. It's kind of interesting, huh? [[01:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=4228.54s)]
*  Yeah, I grew up in a home [[01:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=4231.74s)]
*  Where there was a lot of anger, right? It was probably our number one [[01:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=4234.62s)]
*  Emotion that we had right, you know, uh, it was just farm the table there. It was like you got it was 100% [[01:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=4238.599999999999s)]
*  grass-fed [[01:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=4245.96s)]
*  All right. All right, you know and it was [[01:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=4247.58s)]
*  It was just the only way that we communicated [[01:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=4251.18s)]
*  how much of a responsibility is it of parents to [[01:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=4253.98s)]
*  To [[01:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=4257.5s)]
*  Like teach kids what their feelings are right? Yeah, I I love this [[01:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=4258.7s)]
*  Um, so real quick when you say there was a lot of anger [[01:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=4264.14s)]
*  Was it mostly like outward expressed like yelling screaming? Yeah, mostly yelling screaming throwing things [[01:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=4266.78s)]
*  judgment, okay, um [[01:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=4274.46s)]
*  Those are like the main emotions, you know, and then humor. Okay. So but we otherwise it was just always [[01:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=4276.94s)]
*  You knew somebody was gonna be angry where were you in the in the birth order I was number two [[01:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=4283.26s)]
*  I have an older brother and two sisters. Okay, and the sisters are both younger than you. Yep. They're both younger and everybody's [[01:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=4288.9400000000005s)]
*  um [[01:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=4294.54s)]
*  Alive still pretty much. Okay [[01:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=4295.740000000001s)]
*  Pretty much. Yeah, I mean some people are you know, got it [[01:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=4298.54s)]
*  They're willing to risk it all, you know, but uh, some of us are doing our best [[01:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=4302.620000000001s)]
*  So but yeah, so that's where we had and that was just it was a lot of anger in there [[01:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=4306.46s)]
*  You know, I think that um [[01:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=4311.58s)]
*  My feeling is with with kids in particular [[01:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=4315.02s)]
*  I mean we can think about this from the well i'll start with what I consider to be sort of the golden rule of [[01:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=4317.66s)]
*  of emotion and and parenting and that is that [[01:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=4324.22s)]
*  kids tend to express emotions the way their caregivers did [[01:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=4328.06s)]
*  And so they tend to and it's it's rooted in like age-old psychology that we it's called modeling, right? [[01:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=4331.9800000000005s)]
*  And so kids tend to model what their parents did that if mom or dad yell and scream kids tend to yell and scream [[01:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=4338.38s)]
*  as a way of of dealing with emotions and [[01:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=4345.5s)]
*  Now there's some caveats that because simultaneously the the other side is that you know kids sometimes get rewarded or punished [[01:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=4349.9800000000005s)]
*  for emotional expressions [[01:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=4358.06s)]
*  Of particular types, right? So a kid hits somebody and they get punished for it. Um, yeah [[01:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=4359.9800000000005s)]
*  Um now oddly enough sometimes they get punished for it by getting hit by by the parent right getting spanked or whatever, right? [[01:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=4364.94s)]
*  That's kind of wild when you think about like, yeah, right and so um, or they get in trouble for yelling by being yelled at [[01:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=4372.46s)]
*  Um, you know, so like there's all sorts of mixed messages there. Um [[01:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=4378.46s)]
*  But to me, I mean some of the the healthiest things you can do with kids when you're when you're trying to raise emotionally wise children [[01:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=4384.0599999999995s)]
*  is to [[01:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=4392.38s)]
*  Talk about feelings often to give them the the give them the language to have that conversation to help them identify [[01:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=4394.54s)]
*  What they're feeling? Yeah, I think that's a big problem for a lot of people for a lot of kids and it continues is [[01:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=4401.5s)]
*  They don't know the difference between anger and sadness. They don't know the difference between fear and anger [[01:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=4407.900000000001s)]
*  Oh, yeah, I would just start vibe, you know, yeah every night you see that kid [[01:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=4413.58s)]
*  He's just vibrating you don't know what's going on. You gotta show him a [[01:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=4416.7s)]
*  Um flash card or something, you know, and say that's joy that's anger that's but yeah, because you don't know right? [[01:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=4420.0599999999995s)]
*  and so helping kids to I mean one of the things I like to do with my kids and is [[01:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=4427.099999999999s)]
*  And liked when they were young is to like unpack those emotional experiences with them and and not just their own but [[01:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=4432.46s)]
*  When they see a kid [[01:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=4439.34s)]
*  You know melting down or a kid getting angry or sad or scared or whatever to say [[01:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=4441.26s)]
*  So what do you think's going on like what where did that come from? [[01:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=4445.9s)]
*  Why you know if we're watching tv and a kid reacts some right just so at least they can have in their own head like, okay [[01:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=4449.259999999999s)]
*  This is what happens when this happens. Yeah, this is what I look like when it happens [[01:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=4454.7s)]
*  This is where I can start to see in somebody else what's going on and then you'll recognize it in yourself and at least have [[01:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=4458.7s)]
*  Some sort of you'll be the conductor in some way as much as you can [[01:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=4464.62s)]
*  Yep, maybe some of the outcomes if not some of the origins of the feeling [[01:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=4468.46s)]
*  Yeah, and then you can even talk through, you know, what are some options for them now, right? [[01:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=4471.98s)]
*  You know those kids right? Yeah, you know just had this just it's feeling really hurt [[01:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=4475.58s)]
*  What can what can he or she do? [[01:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=4480.3s)]
*  To deal with those feelings are hurt [[01:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=4482.62s)]
*  And I mean, I think those are all are like good healthy ways [[01:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=4484.3s)]
*  But I think it starts with wanting to make sure people are having those conversations that people are really understanding it [[01:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=4487.82s)]
*  because part of what happens too is that people can realize that you know that [[01:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=4493.74s)]
*  We like to believe and i've even been saying, you know [[01:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=4498.38s)]
*  Look your your your feelings are one of the ways your brain tells you what what's going on what you're experiencing [[01:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=4500.54s)]
*  That doesn't necessarily mean that they're rooted in logic or reality or that they're even really valid, right? [[01:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=4506.14s)]
*  We can be angry over a misunderstanding. We can be scared over something. That's not really dangerous [[01:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=4513.1s)]
*  um, and [[01:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=4518.86s)]
*  The feelings are real right? We shouldn't minimize that [[01:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=4520.38s)]
*  But we should take some time to like unpack them and talk about like what what is what's going on? [[01:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=4523.66s)]
*  Why yeah, I think that kind of stuff is important at least because I think for myself along [[01:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=4530.139999999999s)]
*  I didn't know a lot of feelings. I was even having I didn't know I only knew a couple [[01:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=4534.94s)]
*  like [[01:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=4539.179999999999s)]
*  I I remember like [[01:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=4541.58s)]
*  Yeah, like certain things were going on. I wouldn't really have any feelings about it and I was like man [[01:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=4544.0599999999995s)]
*  I never really had a lot of feelings [[01:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=4547.9s)]
*  So I think sometimes talk with your kids like oh, this is a feeling that's what that is [[01:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=4550.299999999999s)]
*  This is what's going on because otherwise you can just think you're bonkers as a child, you know [[01:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=4554.78s)]
*  Like if somebody doesn't tell you kind of what's happening with you [[01:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=4559.419999999999s)]
*  Well, a lot of times kids aren't really allowed to have feelings, right? I mean that like that they're shamed for them [[01:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=4562.0599999999995s)]
*  Yeah, that the message is hey hold that in don't let people see that [[01:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=4567.419999999999s)]
*  And then I mean, of course that's going to continue [[01:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=4572.54s)]
*  into into adulthood [[01:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=4575.58s)]
*  um where [[01:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=4577.82s)]
*  Where they're just they don't feel like they're allowed they don't feel like it's safe to express that stuff [[01:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=4579.66s)]
*  I was thinking if you allow your kids, right like [[01:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=4584.86s)]
*  Like space to feel their feelings [[01:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=4588.7s)]
*  Okay, does that create in them? [[01:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=4591.5s)]
*  Like, you know recognize they're feeling something allow them a little space to feel it, right? [[01:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=4594.62s)]
*  Yeah, does that create like more of like an emotional resilience in them? [[01:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=4598.54s)]
*  Which would just then like then when they're angry again, it would just kind of become another emotion to them sort of like [[01:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=4603.26s)]
*  um, is that many any sense? Yeah, I mean I think [[01:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=4610.0599999999995s)]
*  I think [[01:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=4612.94s)]
*  What what you really want so then in the future they could cope better [[01:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=4614.0599999999995s)]
*  So if it happens to them next time be like, okay [[01:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=4616.78s)]
*  Yep, because what you really want is I mean you want a situation where your kids can [[01:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=4619.9s)]
*  When they're feeling something a know what they're feeling [[01:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=4626.46s)]
*  Be have a sense for where it's coming from understand like its root causes [[01:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=4629.419999999999s)]
*  Be able to critically evaluate those root causes and then know what to do with it, right? [[01:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=4634.46s)]
*  And I mean and that's a that's a level of sophistication that I don't think [[01:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=4638.46s)]
*  Frankly, most people are capable of but it's because [[01:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=4642.94s)]
*  We haven't given them the space or the tools to do that over their lifetime [[01:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=4646.86s)]
*  And I think we're way better than at this as a society now than we were when you and I were kids [[01:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=4650.54s)]
*  Right, like we're way better at at trying to provide those tools to to kids, but it comes with them [[01:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=4655.74s)]
*  It it comes with people being able to have those conversations to say hey [[01:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=4662.379999999999s)]
*  But let's talk about what you're feeling right now not in a like necessarily a judgment or punishy way like hey [[01:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=4668.46s)]
*  You just got real mad you hit your brother [[01:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=4674.94s)]
*  Let's [[01:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=4677.9s)]
*  Let's have a conversation about that. Let's talk about better ways to to handle that [[01:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=4678.94s)]
*  Let's make sure we make up for what we did [[01:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=4682.94s)]
*  So it's not like it's consequence free people oftentimes accuse me of being sort of wimpy and like hey [[01:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=4684.78s)]
*  You're you're letting your kids walk all over you. They got to get punished or whatever. That's it's not that it's consequence free [[01:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=4689.5s)]
*  It's like no we're gonna we're gonna [[01:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=4695.26s)]
*  Deal with with those with those feelings [[01:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=4698.46s)]
*  Um and try and figure out sort of the best way to handle it and yeah that that helps them develop that emotional resilience going forward [[01:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=4702.38s)]
*  Yeah, at least having some emotional understanding of yourself [[01:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=4709.34s)]
*  Yep, but how do you then like put the cap on it where you're like, yeah [[01:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=4712.38s)]
*  it's okay if my kid is you know, like [[01:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=4716.06s)]
*  um [[01:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=4718.540000000001s)]
*  We're like how do we not turn into one of these societies where it's just like oh [[01:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=4719.42s)]
*  I don't feel like going to work today. So i'm not gonna go. Yeah, you know like that's [[01:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=4722.94s)]
*  Nobody ever feels like going away. That's the first thing it should tell you [[01:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=4727.74s)]
*  Yes, you ever go to school [[01:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=4730.46s)]
*  Yeah one day you're gonna go to work and nobody's gonna feel like it that should be the first thing that they teach us [[01:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=4732.46s)]
*  Yeah, no, I mean it's true like like the message also has to be [[01:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=4737.0199999999995s)]
*  That your emotions alone aren't necessarily reason not to do something. Yeah, you know, I mean that's the you know, I I have a [[01:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=4741.339999999999s)]
*  I have two kids [[01:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=4748.78s)]
*  Both of them are are very very awesome in different ways. But the you know, the one is he's he's a performer [[01:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=4750.62s)]
*  He's a dancer and he he's in [[01:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=4756.62s)]
*  A lot of musicals and things like that [[01:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=4759.0199999999995s)]
*  And he one of the things that I can say about him is people people often talk about how brave he is and he is [[01:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=4760.46s)]
*  But I know him well enough to know that he he gets real anxious about about performing and those things [[01:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=4765.259999999999s)]
*  He's feeling that fear. It's not that he's not scared [[01:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=4770.86s)]
*  It's that he knows how to do things anyways [[01:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=4774.299999999999s)]
*  And that's where you want people to get like you want people to get to a point of [[01:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=4776.7s)]
*  Right now, you know what? I'm feeling sad and I don't feel like being able to go [[01:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=4780.7s)]
*  I don't feel like going to work, but I also need to do it. I understand what my responsibilities are [[01:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=4783.900000000001s)]
*  And I can work through that [[01:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=4788.3s)]
*  um [[01:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=4789.9800000000005s)]
*  And and I think like there's there's something to be said for [[01:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=4790.86s)]
*  I mean to me that's a big part of what emotional resilience is [[01:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=4795.42s)]
*  It's being able to to feel things and then overcome those feelings at times, right? [[01:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=4798.3s)]
*  Yeah, and I think if you give your kids space for that it feels like you're gonna [[01:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=4802.7s)]
*  That that's a armor you can create in them as well. Yep. It's like hey you feel sad right now [[01:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=4806.62s)]
*  Or you feel a little disappointed. This is how you can manage that right now and look five minutes later [[01:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=4811.1s)]
*  Wow, look, we're right back to where we were before everything's good [[01:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=4816.06s)]
*  So then when they have those things happen in their own lives when you're not around they're gonna have like some sort of [[01:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=4818.86s)]
*  Even if it's just brief little [[01:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=4825.18s)]
*  Check-ins from a parent are huge. Well, you can I mean that's the thing [[01:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=4827.18s)]
*  I mean and this isn't just about parenting. This is about being a supervisor. It's about being a human being [[01:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=4830.14s)]
*  You can be sensitive and have expectations. Yeah, right [[01:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=4835.820000000001s)]
*  You can you can be sensitive to your your kids emotional needs and have things you expect them to do [[01:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=4839.740000000001s)]
*  You can be sensitive to your employees and have expectations of them, right? You know and and frankly [[01:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=4846.22s)]
*  You can be sensitive to yourself and you can be sort of patient and caring with yourself and still have expectations for [[01:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=4853.02s)]
*  What you want to accomplish. Yeah, that's a tough one. Sometimes. Yeah, give me yourself some grace. Mm-hmm [[01:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=4860.06s)]
*  I'm terrible at it. Are you? Yeah. Yeah, i'm really hard on myself. Yeah me too, man. Yeah god [[01:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=4865.820000000001s)]
*  That probably back when we were talking about type a at the beginning, right? That's probably part of it [[01:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=4871.1s)]
*  right is like you you're you know, you're competitive your success driven and and that means [[01:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=4875.42s)]
*  You you want to accomplish certain things and that means being a certain way [[01:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=4881.26s)]
*  Yeah [[01:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=4885.42s)]
*  Yeah, it's interesting because I don't know when I would ever give myself the benefit of the doubt very often [[01:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=4886.54s)]
*  You know, I almost have to have someone say hey man, give yourself some grace here, right? [[01:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=4890.7s)]
*  like in like feel some pride, you know, I think uh [[01:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=4896.14s)]
*  And then sometimes I don't blame this on my being a kid or whatever [[01:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=4901.26s)]
*  But I think I never knew anything. I never knew any nobody like [[01:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=4903.98s)]
*  I never knew what I was feeling or what was going on [[01:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=4908.94s)]
*  So I think even things like that with your kid like hey man, you can feel proud of yourself [[01:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=4910.86s)]
*  Like I know some of it sounds lame probably in some senses [[01:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=4914.46s)]
*  But the cost of not doing it with your kids I think can be kind of immense. Yep [[01:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=4917.9s)]
*  Because growing up not knowing like having my own sense of what's okay for me [[01:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=4924.3s)]
*  Leaves me at the whim of what other people think is okay for me, you know, and that can just get kind of harrowing. I'm not [[01:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=4930.7s)]
*  You know trying to like woe is me. That's not fully my story, but it can I could see it being really risky for folks [[01:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=4937.66s)]
*  Yeah [[01:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=4943.66s)]
*  You know for me one of the things that's been really helpful is to surround myself with really good people [[01:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=4944.7s)]
*  um who who care about me and that there are people who who um [[01:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=4950.78s)]
*  You know when i'm being hard on myself [[01:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=4955.42s)]
*  Sometimes it's nice to have a friend who can sort of step in and remind me like hey, you know [[01:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=4956.94s)]
*  It's okay to it's okay to to not have things happen exactly as you want them [[01:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=4961.42s)]
*  It's okay to to take a break and just be proud of what you accomplished today. And it's nice to have [[01:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=4965.74s)]
*  People in your life who who can support you that way? [[01:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=4972.14s)]
*  Yeah, so yeah, it feels like we always have to be making something better these days, too [[01:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=4975.42s)]
*  Yeah, like that and every it'd be like [[01:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=4980.22s)]
*  If you if you knew somebody and something was wrong with them people would just be like dang something's wrong with him [[01:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=4982.86s)]
*  Yep, you know and then 10 years later people would be like dang how's Ernie and then people like something is wrong with him [[01:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=4987.58s)]
*  Like it had escalated, you know, like he bought it up an empty swimming pool and he was spending time in there [[01:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=4994.38s)]
*  And so but now it's like is that a real story? [[01:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=5000.06s)]
*  Is there a real person, you know who bought an empty swimming pool and there was some men in our neighborhood that would kind of like [[01:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=5003.26s)]
*  Meet up or whatever like this empty swimming pool at night and smoke weed or whatever [[01:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=5009.1s)]
*  Whenever I hear you drop an example like that part of me is like did that just come from his brain or is that like a real thing? [[01:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=5013.1s)]
*  Oh, no, that was a real thing. We grew up in a very shirtless area if you will it was very [[01:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=5018.3s)]
*  a lot of people just [[01:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=5024.7s)]
*  A lot of people whistling and no shirts [[01:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=5026.7s)]
*  Just a lot of okay [[01:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=5029.9s)]
*  I like that doing their best. That was a good description. I like that. Yeah, I can imagine what this [[01:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=5031.74s)]
*  This area was like we grew up in the stray animal belt brother [[01:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=5037.1s)]
*  So there was just a lot of yeah a lot of shirtless people and shirtless people and no collars on these animals either [[01:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=5039.82s)]
*  You know i'm saying everybody was just risking it all [[01:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=5045.42s)]
*  um [[01:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=5048.7s)]
*  Can uh, can we still have childhood anger? [[01:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=5049.98s)]
*  As adults like what happens to anger from our childhood that is it processed or what happens to unprocessed anger? [[01:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=5053.26s)]
*  Yeah, you know, I think two things are can can be true here, right? [[01:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=5059.9s)]
*  I think on the one hand yeah, we can absolutely still have [[01:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=5063.5s)]
*  You know anger and resentment and stuff that happened when we were a kid that we continued to be mad about [[01:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=5067.66s)]
*  Forever. I also think that it's sort of never too late to process some of that stuff, right? [[01:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=5073.58s)]
*  I mean, yeah, you know and that that there's no reason why in your 40s or 50s [[01:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=5079.18s)]
*  You can't start to deal with some of the stuff that you're you were mad about [[01:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=5083.9s)]
*  still from childhood it might be harder and I also think we have to be honest about what the [[01:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=5089.74s)]
*  What the outcome is going to be right? I mean, we have to recognize that some of those things [[01:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=5095.58s)]
*  I guess think about what dealing with it looks like because I can't it's a good point [[01:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=5101.26s)]
*  You brought it up earlier with the other topic is like follow think it. Um, what outcome you want to have? [[01:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=5105.58s)]
*  What was the other one? Yeah. No, it's like what are your goals here? [[01:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=5110.86s)]
*  and and I think the thing is like [[01:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=5113.42s)]
*  You know when you're when you're i'm 48 years old right when you're 48 you might not [[01:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=5115.5s)]
*  You might not be able to make to fix the bad stuff that happened that you're still frustrated by so that can't be the goal [[01:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=5120.54s)]
*  but maybe it is to forgive maybe it's to [[01:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=5127.66s)]
*  better understand where [[01:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=5132.3s)]
*  If it is a person who wronged you where that person was coming from. I mean those are all [[01:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=5134.54s)]
*  Um [[01:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=5139.34s)]
*  Things that we can try and process ways we can try and deal with maybe it's just to forgive ourselves for for [[01:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=5140.54s)]
*  You know not handling it in a different way man. Forgive ourselves for not being able to forgive people even yeah [[01:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=5147.179999999999s)]
*  That sounds crazy. Right? [[01:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=5153.82s)]
*  Right because that sometimes it's like [[01:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=5155.98s)]
*  That's crazy. I never thought about that. Sometimes it's not even that i'm upset anymore as much [[01:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=5159.099999999999s)]
*  That I can't forgive the person [[01:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=5164.22s)]
*  It's like I start to get upset at myself because I can't [[01:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=5166.38s)]
*  Forgive the person so i'm not upset at the person anymore. Right? I'm just upset at me because i'm having trouble forgiving [[01:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=5170.62s)]
*  Is that crazy? Yeah, no that I mean not crazy that that's really interesting and insightful, right? I'm I'm [[01:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=5175.42s)]
*  I'm still mad at this person. I feel like I shouldn't be and i'm [[01:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=5181.42s)]
*  Struggling mad at me because I can't forgive them. Yeah, okay. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, yeah sometimes that [[01:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=5185.1s)]
*  I would just notice it can hop from one thing a thing like that and I don't even know exactly what i'm mad about, you know [[01:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=5190.78s)]
*  Um, that's what you know, I was thinking about it earlier like so I was once a [[01:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=5197.98s)]
*  Um, I was once a really bad student. Really? Yeah, I know that's surprising to people. Yeah, I really really struggled in high school [[01:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=5202.46s)]
*  Um, and I actually failed out of my first university [[01:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=5209.82s)]
*  and um [[01:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=5213.58s)]
*  God, I know it was [[01:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=5215.099999999999s)]
*  And and a lot of it came I mean it came from a lot of different places like one of them was um, [[01:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=5217.26s)]
*  uh [[01:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=5223.1s)]
*  So I was a die-hard soccer player, uh and soccer fan at the time and I had a hard time like [[01:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=5224.700000000001s)]
*  Not being more interested in that than in school. Okay, so you just love soccer someone. Yep, and same thing [[01:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=5231.58s)]
*  I I drank too much my my first year in college too. That was that was relevant [[01:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=5237.5s)]
*  Not in high school at all, but in college that was a problem [[01:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=5243.099999999999s)]
*  but also I just hadn't developed a lot of like the study skills necessary to be successful and um, [[01:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=5245.82s)]
*  and so [[01:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=5251.98s)]
*  I I still like I I [[01:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=5252.94s)]
*  Years later. I still find myself sort of struggling with that like mad at myself for not having done better mad at myself for not having [[01:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=5255.42s)]
*  made more of [[01:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=5262.62s)]
*  Of my college experience because what happened is I took a I took a break like six months off [[01:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=5264.0599999999995s)]
*  I traveled a little bit. I was very very fortunate that like I had a safety net, you know [[01:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=5269.34s)]
*  It didn't mean I was like homeless. I I could right you could afford to go somewhere and travel [[01:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=5274.54s)]
*  Yep [[01:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=5278.860000000001s)]
*  And I and I had I could live with my mom for a little while while I sort of figured things out in ways [[01:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=5279.1s)]
*  that a lot of my students can't you know, and and so um [[01:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=5283.1s)]
*  so, um [[01:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=5287.74s)]
*  having that [[01:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=5289.58s)]
*  Um, I went back to college and I kind of got it together right after taking a little break [[01:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=5291.02s)]
*  But but I'm mad at myself still for not having a different kind of college experience, you know, wow [[01:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=5295.58s)]
*  Yeah, man, that's funny. I'll get upset at myself with like yeah that I didn't have a blast in college [[01:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=5302.06s)]
*  Sometimes like that's just this general term that's in my head man. I'm upset that I didn't have a blast in college [[01:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=5307.34s)]
*  Yeah, but if I went and looked through a calendar and shit people be like dude you had a great time, right? [[01:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=5312.780000000001s)]
*  It's like sometimes I don't even remember things correctly [[01:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=5318.3s)]
*  It's like my perspective of them isn't even clean and then or clear and then i'll get upset [[01:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=5320.78s)]
*  At a unreal and then i'll be like fuck man. I got a fucking or i'll be like dang man [[01:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=5327.099999999999s)]

*  I can't play but I could still be a mascot, you know [[01:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=5335.34s)]
*  You just start going and then it's like i'm in this weird anger against myself and it's maybe the perspective wasn't clear [[01:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=5338.38s)]
*  You know or well, yeah. Well a lot of times our our emotions [[01:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=5343.179999999999s)]
*  Our memories of emotional experiences aren't accurate dude [[01:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=5347.900000000001s)]
*  Why and so I mean part of it is that we hit the highlights or the low lights, right? [[01:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=5351.740000000001s)]
*  And so like if you think about a uh, it's actually somebody did a study on this [[01:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=5356.46s)]
*  Where they had people? [[01:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=5360.700000000001s)]
*  Monitor their emotions over the course of a week-long vacation and then when they came back they took a survey [[01:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=5362.3s)]
*  How did did you enjoy the vacation? Right? And what they found is that there was very little correlation between those two things [[01:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=5368.38s)]
*  because [[01:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=5374.860000000001s)]
*  When people are are at the end of a trip when they're saying how did you feel? [[01:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=5375.98s)]
*  They're reflecting on the high points or the low points, right? And they're just thinking and like the overall experience was super rad [[01:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=5380.299999999999s)]
*  I was in jamaica. It was great. I loved it. What they forget is [[01:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=5386.0599999999995s)]
*  You know how long it took to get their luggage [[01:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=5390.139999999999s)]
*  What they forget like getting stuck in traffic for hours and hours and hours bugs or whatever all that stuff and so violence or whatever [[01:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=5392.7s)]
*  Yep [[01:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=5399.58s)]
*  And so they they forget all that stuff and they just focus on those other things or the and I think the same thing could be [[01:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=5399.9s)]
*  True of college, right? It's like you you you think about sort of the high points or the low points [[01:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=5404.94s)]
*  you don't think about the [[01:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=5410.219999999999s)]
*  like [[01:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=5412.46s)]
*  You know the other sort of of elements to think that happen the day in and day out stuff [[01:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=5413.339999999999s)]
*  Yeah, and um, or or sort of we think about like an overall theme of what it was like instead of instead of [[01:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=5417.98s)]
*  Um, you know that those those day in and day out experiences. Yeah, I think it's called chunking or something [[01:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=5425.58s)]
*  I'm not sure how our why our brain our memory does that i've been reading this book [[01:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=5431.1s)]
*  By this guy dr sangharath, but it's about our memories and stuff. It's really it's pretty interesting. Yeah [[01:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=5436.9400000000005s)]
*  um, dude, sometimes when it comes to my anger and stuff, I will even like [[01:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=5443.02s)]
*  Like I think I remember being so angry as a kid I almost [[01:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=5449.5s)]
*  Like I enjoy my anger in a way [[01:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=5454.860000000001s)]
*  Because it's like I had such a relationship with it [[01:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=5457.339999999999s)]
*  I don't know if that sounds crazy or not. No, it doesn't [[01:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=5460.38s)]
*  I mean, I think I don't enjoy it isn't I want to like act it out or something or vandalize a shelter or whatever? [[01:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=5463.259999999999s)]
*  but like that I want to [[01:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=5469.259999999999s)]
*  Like if I there's a part of me still that when I get angry it connects to that kid part of me [[01:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=5471.98s)]
*  That was angry and it's like this is it's ours, you know [[01:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=5476.38s)]
*  Well, I think all of us like, you know, we've been talking about anger as an emotion and it is but it's also [[01:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=5480.38s)]
*  Sometimes a personality trait, right? It's a it's a oh really? [[01:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=5485.26s)]
*  Yeah [[01:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=5488.3s)]
*  I mean [[01:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=5488.46s)]
*  It's a it's a characteristic like some there are some people who are just angrier than others or some people express their anger more outwardly [[01:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=5488.700000000001s)]
*  Or experience more consequences and and because of that [[01:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=5494.780000000001s)]
*  um [[01:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=5498.540000000001s)]
*  You know and I think with any personality trait sometimes as human beings we we cling to things that we sort of [[01:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=5499.740000000001s)]
*  like as defining [[01:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=5506.620000000001s)]
*  Characteristics right and so like and we we we cling to those as things that like make us proud of ourselves or that we enjoy [[01:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=5508.62s)]
*  Or whatever. Um, so maybe a person says well, hey like i'm i'm kind that's that's that's just who I am and I lean into that [[01:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=5516.0599999999995s)]
*  Um, maybe someone leans into the idea that they're an angry person and that it's you know, that's kind of how they identify [[01:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=5523.74s)]
*  I think that's true, especially because so [[01:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=5530.54s)]
*  In this i'm not advocating for this but anger is how a lot of successful people get things done, right? [[01:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=5533.5s)]
*  Now, do you ever watch the show entourage? Yeah. Okay. So ah re gold that that character, you know, that's rooted in a real life person [[01:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=5538.94s)]
*  um, and he who I think had [[01:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=5546.46s)]
*  um, like used those kinds of of um [[01:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=5549.0199999999995s)]
*  Yeah tactics and used angry aggressive approach to to manipulate people [[01:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=5553.74s)]
*  And to um to get people to do what he what he wanted right and so like that's someone who I think [[01:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=5559.02s)]
*  um [[01:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=5564.78s)]
*  Probably like appreciates that he identifies as an angry person, right? You know, he appreciates that he identifies that way [[01:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=5565.66s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I think it's like this is just part of who I am and it's part of what makes me successful [[01:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=5572.62s)]
*  Oh, I see [[01:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=5576.86s)]
*  But then is that just a cop out of somebody that doesn't want to deal with their anger though? [[01:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=5577.5s)]
*  Probably I mean I think for a lot of people that's that's them [[01:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=5580.86s)]
*  It's uh, I think they're scared to change it's like I mean if this is the thing that i've [[01:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=5584.62s)]
*  Identified as making me successful well then dealing with it might mean that i'm no longer going to be successful [[01:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=5589.16s)]
*  I'm gonna be good at what I do [[01:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=5594.86s)]
*  Can um, but if it's a trait then so it can be a real thing that some people are just [[01:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=5596.86s)]
*  are [[01:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=5603.0199999999995s)]
*  Yeah, I mean it I think like any trait like without any provocate like without any [[01:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=5604.0599999999995s)]
*  Yeah, there I think there's still provocations. I just think that they're quick that it doesn't take as much right? [[01:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=5608.86s)]
*  And so it doesn't take as much of a provocation to make someone mad [[01:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=5613.58s)]
*  Okay, and it's still I mean it it it still comes from a combination of upbringing probably some genetics [[01:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=5617.34s)]
*  You know that people are more likely to be angry much of the time [[01:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=5624.86s)]
*  You know and and so it still comes from from that place. What are parenting strategies to assist kids with? [[01:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=5630.7s)]
*  coping with anger, yeah, like um, [[01:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=5639.22s)]
*  like like not feeling anger very often or [[01:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=5642.38s)]
*  Yeah, like what are some of those do you feel yeah, I mean I think [[01:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=5648.74s)]
*  for [[01:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=5653.179999999999s)]
*  What I would say is there's there's when it comes to to [[01:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=5654.42s)]
*  Kids one of the probably the most important things to do is is help them develop the tools that allow them to [[01:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=5658.099999999999s)]
*  Sort of find ways to decrease their anger in the moment right and that's oftentimes for kids going to be [[01:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=5664.0599999999995s)]
*  Deep breathing it's gonna be [[01:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=5669.46s)]
*  Distraction is actually a really good one to find something else you can do for a little while [[01:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=5672.1s)]
*  Maybe it's we talked about drawing earlier. Maybe it's playing with Legos [[01:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=5675.700000000001s)]
*  Maybe it's petting your dog whatever things like that that allow you to to sort of de-escalate [[01:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=5678.860000000001s)]
*  Yeah, the other side of it is you know helping kids identify where they have some control [[01:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=5684.22s)]
*  This is harder with kids because I think they have a little less control in their their day-to-day life [[01:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=5690.02s)]
*  Where can kids have control in their? [[01:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=5694.42s)]
*  Surroundings in their environment how can they sort of do less of the things that [[01:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=5698.139999999999s)]
*  that provoke [[01:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=5705.34s)]
*  That might provoke anger right my son is a my other son is a die-hard [[01:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=5706.86s)]
*  Basketball fan and he's he's a player and fan and so we've been watching the NBA quite a bit [[01:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=5712.46s)]
*  I'm from Minnesota originally, so okay, so you guys are in huh? Yeah, so we're Timberwolves fans [[01:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=5718.0199999999995s)]
*  But you know and he handles you know [[01:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=5722.66s)]
*  They won last night that was great, but they've been you know they're down a couple of games [[01:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=5725.1s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, and he he handles it well, but you know it takes a toll on him like he gets sad [[01:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=5730.1s)]
*  He's 12 years old he gets sad when they when they lose and so that's the kind of thing that like over time [[01:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=5734.700000000001s)]
*  You know you want to think about what kind of impact that's having you want to think about how much it's influencing you [[01:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=5741.02s)]
*  You want to think about whether or not you? [[01:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=5746.02s)]
*  As a parent you mean yeah like a kid doing something if it's something that like you know [[01:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=5748.620000000001s)]
*  Doing something if it's something that like what they're engaged what they're absorbing you mean yeah [[01:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=5753.34s)]
*  I mean as a parent you want you want them to be thinking about [[01:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=5757.3s)]
*  How much time they're spending and this thing that ends up having taking an emotional toll on it [[01:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=5760.9800000000005s)]
*  Yeah, is it good to let your children feel anger is it yeah? [[01:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=5766.7s)]
*  I think so I mean I think it like anything I mean up up to a point [[01:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=5769.62s)]
*  You know I think it's good to let them because that's how they're gonna deal with the I mean [[01:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=5773.06s)]
*  I think the art of dealing with emotions is is it's [[01:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=5778.9800000000005s)]
*  Liking it to exercise I saw a [[01:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=5783.06s)]
*  Post years working out the other day right you're on a run or something. Oh, yeah, yeah, I like to run [[01:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=5785.78s)]
*  Yeah, me too every day you do I do yeah wow I think it's great great for my mental health great for for everything [[01:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=5790.22s)]
*  but it the thing about [[01:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=5797.3s)]
*  I [[01:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=5799.82s)]
*  Think it's similar dealing with emotions is similar to exercise in that [[01:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=5801.06s)]
*  You know when you exercise you push yourself to a place of discomfort, okay? [[01:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=5804.98s)]
*  Never so uncomfortable that it's actually harmful right and I think you can do the same thing with emotions [[01:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=5809.38s)]
*  You can push yourself into a zone where this emotion is uncomfortable with me for me [[01:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=5814.5s)]
*  But it's not so uncomfortable that I'm suffering right and so it's like I want to feel some fear [[01:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=5819.900000000001s)]
*  Because I want to get used to dealing with that discomfort [[01:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=5827.22s)]
*  And I want to sort of learn to cope with it [[01:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=5829.86s)]
*  But I don't want to feel so much fear that I'm like on the floor shaking or anything like that [[01:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=5832.9800000000005s)]
*  Yeah, and with kids I want them to feel I want them to feel some anxiety and learn that they can just do the thing [[01:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=5837.74s)]
*  Anyways, yeah, I want them to feel some fear some anger and learn that they can do the thing anyways [[01:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=5844.219999999999s)]
*  And work through it. That's a good healthy way to be [[01:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=5849.78s)]
*  Yeah, it's just interesting when you think about like that. It's a parent's responsibility to do all of that right now [[01:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=5853.099999999999s)]
*  How many little things that they learn because of how the parents let them absorb it or and that's I think one of the challenges [[01:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=5859.34s)]
*  I imagine that you know, you know our parents our parents age [[01:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=5866.26s)]
*  Didn't [[01:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=5872.9400000000005s)]
*  It wasn't on the radar. Yeah to be thinking about stuff like this [[01:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=5874.9400000000005s)]
*  No, you know that they just didn't know and so they weren't necessarily attuned to like what what kids might need [[01:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=5878.06s)]
*  Or benefit from from an emotional perspective. Yeah, it was a different time [[01:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=5885.62s)]
*  another thing that really I'll get angry is [[01:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=5890.900000000001s)]
*  If I expect people to it's kind of unrealistic expectations, but it's [[01:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=5894.74s)]
*  Thinking people should know what I want even if I haven't explained it [[01:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=5899.139999999999s)]
*  Yeah, it's there's a name for this and it's escaping me right now, but there is that sort of like [[01:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=5902.74s)]
*  It's like the opposite of mind-reading. It's like they should be able to read your mind, right? [[01:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=5908.26s)]
*  And I know exactly yeah, and so it's like hey [[01:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=5912.38s)]
*  Why don't they know exactly the way I want this thing done and then why aren't they doing it that way? [[01:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=5916.48s)]
*  Yeah, and and for people who are ambitious and people who you know are success-driven [[01:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=5921.54s)]
*  Then that becomes a a sticking point as part of that type a thing that I mentioned before right it becomes a sticking point [[01:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=5927.58s)]
*  Leads to that that frustration [[01:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=5934.42s)]
*  You know why why isn't it happening the way I wanted to? [[01:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=5937.76s)]
*  What other personality types and what types of angers do they have do they have all of specific angers or not really? [[01:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=5940.66s)]
*  Just find that type a has more. Yeah [[01:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=5945.82s)]
*  I mean type a is I mean originally part of how it was sort of identified was that it was that that people with type a [[01:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=5947.82s)]
*  With that behavior pattern they called it at the time they were that they were [[01:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=5955.219999999999s)]
*  Angrier more aggressive [[01:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=5960.98s)]
*  One of the things you mentioned was goals being blocked and I guess if you have if you're driven like that or have that extra like [[01:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=5962.98s)]
*  Drive which can be a blessing and a curse sometimes then you would have more goals [[01:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=5969.9s)]
*  Just even generally floating around in your head [[01:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=5973.74s)]
*  Yeah [[01:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=5976.179999999999s)]
*  another [[01:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=5976.82s)]
*  Strategy not that not like the the disorder obsessive compulsive disorder [[01:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=5977.86s)]
*  But sort of an obsessive compulsive personality type is also associated with anger for similar reasons [[01:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=5981.86s)]
*  It's like I want things the way I want them and because I want them this way when other people don't live up to that [[01:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=5988.0599999999995s)]
*  Expectation it makes me mad right you know I want my home a certain way [[01:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=5994.22s)]
*  And if people don't set it up that way if they don't if they won't [[01:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=5997.8s)]
*  Do the things I want I get angry yeah, yeah, and so it's like [[01:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=6002.58s)]
*  You know people who are really kind of rule driven or have want things in a specific way [[01:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=6007.74s)]
*  Are just more likely to to get angry. That's why you know if we think about [[01:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=6014.58s)]
*  Some of those what we call the big five personality traits one of them like people who are a little bit more open a little [[01:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=6019.66s)]
*  Bit more flexible are less likely to to experience anger gosh [[01:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=6026.139999999999s)]
*  Yeah, gosh those people are good. I would drink. Oh almost feel like I would drink their blood [[01:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=6030.259999999999s)]
*  It's that crazy to say that because I just that's I'll just I wish I could have some more of that [[01:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=6035.179999999999s)]
*  Yeah, no I get it. I mean it's yeah [[01:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=6040.759999999999s)]
*  I mean that this thing we know is that I think there's a real drive right now and in sort of modern sort of pop [[01:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=6042.98s)]
*  psychology to [[01:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=6048.66s)]
*  Be really accepting of all personality traits, and I think I mean I get why we should be accepting and be supportive [[01:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=6049.9s)]
*  But I think we should also acknowledge that there are some ways of being that might end up being a little healthier than other [[01:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=6056.0199999999995s)]
*  Ways right and and openness is a is a great quality right and [[01:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=6061.139999999999s)]
*  Conscientiousness is a great quality those things agreeableness right those things are [[01:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=6066.179999999999s)]
*  Are the kinds of things that that help people be successful in in a lot of ways and help them be likable and help them be happy [[01:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=6070.86s)]
*  Yeah [[01:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=6076.94s)]
*  What about in relationships you guys talk about a lot about that like? [[01:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=6078.0599999999995s)]
*  How do you deal with a if you have a spouse that you feel like has some anger issues [[01:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=6082.3s)]
*  Yeah [[01:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=6087.660000000001s)]
*  That is really tough especially because anger issues in families can look lots of different ways right because there's the there's the kind that is [[01:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=6088.780000000001s)]
*  Really scary and potentially like bordering on abuse where the anger is driven at the particular person right it's the [[01:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=6096.740000000001s)]
*  Angry husband yelling at the angry wife or vice versa right and and that's one way it can look the other way [[01:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=6105.02s)]
*  is just [[01:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=6112.06s)]
*  A person who's just angry at the world doesn't necessarily take it out on the family [[01:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=6113.38s)]
*  And that's actually the way my dad was like he was an angry guy [[01:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=6118.42s)]
*  He didn't I I can count on one hand the number of times. He yelled at me [[01:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=6121.620000000001s)]
*  It wasn't the the victim right is usually the waiter or the gas station attendant or some other driver [[01:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=6126.1s)]
*  You know and so [[01:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=6133.46s)]
*  Those but that still has consequences right it still scared me as a kid right I mean [[01:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=6135.9800000000005s)]
*  Yeah, would have scared me if he were yelling at me, but it also scared me when he's yelling at a stranger right and [[01:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=6141.62s)]
*  You know those those moments [[01:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=6148.14s)]
*  Can really sort of take a toll. I mean I think you know [[01:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=6151.18s)]
*  Relationships are obviously tricky. I think a lot of times with with relationships. It's got to be about communication [[01:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=6155.38s)]
*  It's got to be about like a person being willing to do the work to try and change [[01:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=6162.26s)]
*  And what kind of help do people need that are that have severe [[01:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=6167.34s)]
*  Problems that's the thing I think it's you know there are lots of things that people can do on their own without a professional [[01:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=6171.740000000001s)]
*  But ultimately when the when the situation is bad enough people need to talk to a therapist right and how do they recognize? [[01:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=6179.1s)]
*  When it's bad enough. Do you think sorry? I keep stacking questions on no. That's all right. Those are great questions [[01:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=6186.820000000001s)]
*  I mean, I mean I think usually it should be driven by the the consequences and and to me [[01:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=6191.26s)]
*  For me if a partner came to me and said hey your anger is [[01:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=6198.14s)]
*  Making me uncomfortable your anger scaring me or it's making like to me [[01:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=6202.1s)]
*  That's enough for me to want to say okay [[01:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=6206.26s)]
*  I got to do something about it, and if I can't on my own well [[01:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=6208.34s)]
*  Then I'm gonna go get some help get some help somehow yeah [[01:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=6211.66s)]
*  If it's not in a relationship if it's if it's just you know I'm I'm I find myself getting so angry [[01:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=6215.5s)]
*  I'm like uncomfortable with it, or I don't like living with myself or [[01:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=6223.06s)]
*  It I'm you know drinking too much or whatever as a way of coping with it [[01:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=6228.22s)]
*  Well, then those are all ways that I can those are all signs that I need to meet with someone if I can't fix it [[01:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=6232.34s)]
*  On my own yeah [[01:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=6237.620000000001s)]
*  Yeah, cuz most of my anger usually just comes out about work stuff right you know in person in regular life [[01:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=6239.42s)]
*  I'm usually pretty chill. Yeah, but yeah, I think when it comes to work and wanting to get things done [[01:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=6244.5s)]
*  Yeah, and wanting to be like efficient or yeah a lot of just unrealistic expectations [[01:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=6250.78s)]
*  Well, it sounds like it's motivated like that. There's an undercurrent of stress there right there's an undercurrent of like hey if if I don't [[01:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=6257.78s)]
*  If I don't meet these expectations if I don't accomplish these things something bad's gonna happen right and so [[01:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=6265.9s)]
*  I'm anxious because I have these goals or I'm stressed because I have these goals [[01:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=6272.219999999999s)]
*  And I get mad when things get in the way of them yeah, yeah [[01:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=6276.42s)]
*  Yeah, I think sometimes the motive it's like I think sometimes they come from an unrealistic [[01:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=6280.38s)]
*  Space overall because sometimes I think I just have unrealistic expectations of myself right so that I'll [[01:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=6284.82s)]
*  Never be able to achieve them, so I'll always be at a loss right and so then it'll [[01:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=6291.02s)]
*  couple with some [[01:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=6297.02s)]
*  Some like core belief. I've always had that I'm not enough right that sort of right to me [[01:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=6298.5s)]
*  That's how I've been able to kind of see that yeah what some of that makeup is like and I'm not trying to look [[01:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=6303.06s)]
*  At it. It's like a woe is me. I'm just looking at it. Yeah, no that that's great, and I would I bad [[01:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=6307.580000000001s)]
*  I don't know this out, but but tell me you know I bet sometimes those unreasonable [[01:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=6312.22s)]
*  Expectations the way though they matter like boots on the ground in a particular week or day is that you end up? [[01:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=6317.38s)]
*  Planning too much or trying to do too much [[01:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=6323.54s)]
*  You know and it's like you know you think to yourself well hey for me to achieve X [[01:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=6325.68s)]
*  I've got to get a B&C done this week, and it's impossible to get a B&C done in a single week [[01:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=6330.38s)]
*  Yeah, so you set yourself up for failure that way oh [[01:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=6336.58s)]
*  Yeah, a lot of time won't give things a lot of breathing room right you know and that kind of is a bummer [[01:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=6340.46s)]
*  I know sometimes you'll have a meeting with a frantic like oh [[01:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=6344.82s)]
*  I wish this meeting could be another 45 minutes [[01:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=6346.900000000001s)]
*  But yeah [[01:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=6349.66s)]
*  You know I only set up a certain amount of time because I'm too focused on the work aspect of it and not focused on like [[01:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=6350.38s)]
*  The human aspect of it. Yeah, sometimes that happens. I do this all the time [[01:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=6355.82s)]
*  Like one of my one of my you know I set goals for myself every I do this every semester right I [[01:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=6360.06s)]
*  intentionally I say [[01:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=6366.22s)]
*  These are the things I want to do this semester this year or whatever and then what that translates into is well that means that this [[01:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=6367.700000000001s)]
*  Month I've got to get X Y and Z done [[01:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=6374.620000000001s)]
*  I got to do these things and then that means I [[01:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=6376.18s)]
*  Overplan for a particular week or day, and then I get frustrated with myself [[01:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=6379.26s)]
*  Yeah, and then it connects back to that core belief that you're talking about of [[01:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=6383.660000000001s)]
*  Well I'm not good enough right all right I ruin everything yep, I can't do this what the F [[01:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=6388.02s)]
*  Yep, you F you loser too often the solution to that is that we instead of giving ourselves grace and being patient with ourselves [[01:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=6393.54s)]
*  And saying hey we set impossible goals for ourselves is we just say well [[01:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=6400.820000000001s)]
*  We just need to work harder. Yeah, right, and then we feel crappy when we don't achieve it [[01:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=6405.22s)]
*  Man it's just a lot of my life is I just have to work harder. Yeah, I couldn't yeah [[01:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=6410.7s)]
*  It was tough when I was to have fun [[01:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=6415.64s)]
*  I would tell my friends I've said this before but my friends like let's go do this thing [[01:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=6416.72s)]
*  I'm like I can't go I have to write a book and [[01:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=6419.72s)]
*  That's where my mind always was kind of it was like you can't go do that [[01:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=6422.4800000000005s)]
*  Yeah, you have all this shit to do yeah [[01:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=6427.12s)]
*  Don't you know you have all this shit to do and I would never even look at exactly what the stuff was it was just [[01:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=6429.64s)]
*  This gin and I didn't realize that's a reason like what shit do I have to do like I never even I just [[01:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=6434.6s)]
*  Assumed I had to do all these things it was like this to-do list [[01:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=6439.96s)]
*  That was something was always being added on to yeah [[01:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=6443.639999999999s)]
*  And sometimes it was like the worst part of my brain was was just gonna add things on there no matter what like [[01:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=6446.5599999999995s)]
*  unrealistic things yep like look better [[01:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=6451.919999999999s)]
*  Like all right by 8 p.m.. Or whatever you're like this is crap [[01:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=6455.2s)]
*  We can't do you know just like or just you know you should be different like that's it [[01:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=6459.08s)]
*  But that would be like the kind of just like vague thing that would be on this yeah [[01:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=6463.5599999999995s)]
*  Well, yeah, and then and ultimately you know that to-do list never ends, right? [[01:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=6468.36s)]
*  I mean you just keep adding to it [[01:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=6473.0s)]
*  Because there's always more you can do and so and that's the problem [[01:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=6475.4s)]
*  I mean I've been I've been thinking about this a lot lately with work is that [[01:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=6480.16s)]
*  part of what happens is that we fill up the cracks like we fill up all the time with just more work and and [[01:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=6484.04s)]
*  This is particularly true of ambitious people is that they say well [[01:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=6491.6s)]
*  I can just I can just keep going like there's no end [[01:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=6495.52s)]
*  There's no end to the amount of work [[01:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=6497.64s)]
*  That I can that I can find to fill in and if I want to be successful in the ways [[01:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=6499.68s)]
*  I want to be successful, then that's what I've got to do and then that's that hurts right is we suffer in the long [[01:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=6503.46s)]
*  Yeah, and it makes me think when you're talking about that. Do we have like just such on? [[01:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=6509.160000000001s)]
*  like how do we temper or [[01:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=6513.76s)]
*  How do we [[01:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=6518.08s)]
*  perspectivize our [[01:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=6519.38s)]
*  goals for success how do we look at [[01:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=6520.88s)]
*  Can you help me say what I'm trying to say? Yeah, when are when is it enough right? [[01:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=6524.8s)]
*  I mean yeah, like and how can we even frame it for ourselves so that we're not just have this blind thing [[01:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=6528.52s)]
*  Yeah, like you need to be successful right so that it's actually [[01:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=6532.76s)]
*  Specific and realistic and yeah, and then when is enough right well [[01:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=6536.96s)]
*  I mean because in some way and you said before you like running [[01:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=6540.64s)]
*  I don't know if you do if you do races like if you've ever if you ever run [[01:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=6543.240000000001s)]
*  You know whatever, but I mean it'd be like I don't do races. I would do them okay, but I don't do them yet [[01:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=6547.4400000000005s)]
*  But it's like it's like if every race you did the finish line just kept moving right because we move it on ourselves [[01:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=6553.74s)]
*  And and and we don't accept that like we've accomplished a thing [[01:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=6561.62s)]
*  I do I mean one of the one of the things I do to sort of keep myself happy even though I have this [[01:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=6566.0599999999995s)]
*  This personality style to right where I'm just constantly adding to do's one of the ways [[01:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=6572.26s)]
*  I keep myself happy is by by really marking those [[01:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=6577.42s)]
*  Achievements like when I've finished a thing I [[01:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=6581.6s)]
*  Treat it like an accomplishment. I don't just add to it [[01:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=6584.88s)]
*  I stop and I say we did a thing like let's be be happy about that [[01:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=6588.2s)]
*  Let's be excited now we can we can take a day before we move on to the next thing [[01:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=6592.44s)]
*  so the next thing still gonna be there for me and and I admit I think there's something about me that I [[01:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=6597.92s)]
*  I need that next thing [[01:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=6603.4s)]
*  I don't know what I do like I you know if you want to get to the root of like what scares me most [[01:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=6605.34s)]
*  It's retirement right really. Oh, yeah [[01:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=6610.44s)]
*  I don't know retirement in the sense of having too much time then or retirement in the sense of just not having [[01:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=6613.04s)]
*  Like a specific goal. Maybe it's that I don't know what my brain would do [[01:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=6619.48s)]
*  I don't know how it operate without a thing without a thing to think about or like without work to think about I don't [[01:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=6623.339999999999s)]
*  Know what it would yeah, we got to find out [[01:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=6630.719999999999s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, dude. We got it. Just just just torch your calendar and get a little weird. I feel like [[01:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=6633.16s)]
*  It a little weird I mean, you know just to see what God wants, but it's like [[01:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=6640.759999999999s)]
*  Yeah, oh, I can't imagine dude if somebody said [[01:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=6645.639999999999s)]
*  You can't do that. Like yeah, you can't work tomorrow. Yeah, I [[01:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=6649.919999999999s)]
*  Literally something would crawl out of me. Yeah and go like this. Yep. No, I have [[01:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=6654.32s)]
*  I've been we got furlough days this this year [[01:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=6660.679999999999s)]
*  Do you know you know what a furlough is like for disease or something? No, we we had some [[01:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=6664.04s)]
*  We had to take [[01:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=6669.24s)]
*  Unpaid days like forced to take unpaid days to save the university money and and we're literally not we're gonna do that. Yeah [[01:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=6671.24s)]
*  So we're literally not allowed to work right and and so and and and I [[01:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=6686.56s)]
*  Mean I shouldn't say this cuz I'll get in trouble, but I've been working [[01:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=6693.56s)]
*  I just I just don't use my computer because I'm not allowed to because I'm just like on my phone like [[01:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=6697.36s)]
*  Doing stuff I'm on a different computer just still working [[01:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=6705.32s)]
*  So yeah, I've worked sometimes to keep me away from having to deal with my own personal life. I think sometimes okay [[01:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=6707.799999999999s)]
*  Do people do that? Oh, yeah, absolutely. I mean that's a that's a real [[01:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=6714.5199999999995s)]
*  Distraction for I mean that that's part of part what happens is yeah [[01:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=6719.28s)]
*  Yeah, cuz I think it feels manageable, you know just feels like I can control what's gonna happen, you know, yeah, absolutely I get that [[01:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=6723.639999999999s)]
*  But that's okay. It doesn't mean necessarily a bad thing. No, I don't think so either. I mean, I think like [[01:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=6731.879999999999s)]
*  There are lots of things in people's lives that can be fulfilling and and yeah [[01:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=6738.839999999999s)]
*  Personal relationships are absolutely one of those things and it's people should they're good for us in a good jolly different ways [[01:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=6743.919999999999s)]
*  But people can be fulfilled [[01:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=6750.24s)]
*  By their work especially me that [[01:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=6752.4s)]
*  You know, especially when when they identify ways that their work is really meaningful [[01:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=6755.88s)]
*  And not just to them but to the world around them and if they can see that and then yeah [[01:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=6761.36s)]
*  It's really fulfilling to to do that work [[01:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=6766.639999999999s)]
*  I think what what would make me sad is if I like hit a point where I thought [[01:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=6769.44s)]
*  You know, hey, I've been doing all of this and none of it really mattered, right? [[01:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=6775.2s)]
*  Yeah, or to people in the world right like it all sort of went away I [[01:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=6780.160000000001s)]
*  Don't I don't think that's true of the job. I do I don't think it's true of the job you do [[01:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=6784.8s)]
*  I think it matters to to people and [[01:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=6789.400000000001s)]
*  And it matters to me but but it would be you know for someone whose job was to do whatever [[01:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=6792.08s)]
*  Yeah, you know, I can see that happening. I could see especially like as we get more technologically advanced and we take away jobs [[01:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=6798.320000000001s)]
*  You know [[01:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=6806.400000000001s)]
*  That people start to lose their purpose you have to have some purpose right or you're just you won't have any you won't care [[01:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=6808.32s)]
*  About yourself or anything you right everything has to have a purpose [[01:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=6815.28s)]
*  Yep, and then and then for people it's about well, where do they find that right? [[01:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=6818.599999999999s)]
*  Because maybe it's not work and it's okay if it's not work, right? It could be it could be your hobbies [[01:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=6822.36s)]
*  It could be your family. It could be seeing the world. It could be a billion things. Yeah. Yeah [[01:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=6827.4s)]
*  yeah, I do think though that sometimes with like [[01:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=6832.24s)]
*  Like like I wish there was just something that was like hey no more technology. Yep. Yeah [[01:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=6834.5599999999995s)]
*  Yeah, you know like we're [[01:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=6840.48s)]
*  We're doing fine. We don't need like a robot sheriff in six uber drivers hiding from him old, you know, like like and [[01:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=6842.48s)]
*  everything, you know, it's like that's what it just [[01:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=6851.4s)]
*  yeah, I don't know I think about that sometimes like why we wouldn't stop technology because [[01:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=6854.4s)]
*  It doesn't feel like it serves us sometimes at a certain point, right? [[01:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=6860.72s)]
*  Yeah, well, especially the way in which [[01:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=6864.92s)]
*  We have reacted to it. I mean in so many way technology [[01:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=6868.360000000001s)]
*  I think almost by definition is supposed to make our lives better and supposed to make our lives easier, right? Yeah, and I [[01:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=6872.360000000001s)]
*  Don't necessarily see that happening, right? It makes specific tasks easier, but then we fill up that space with other work [[01:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=6879.08s)]
*  Yeah, right, you know it like [[01:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=6885.88s)]
*  Have you ever tried to do some task that's really easy now? [[01:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=6888.88s)]
*  But have you ever thought about like what it used to be like when we were young? [[01:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=6893.24s)]
*  Oh, yeah, dude, like I even just even writing a sentence the other day. It was like, where are we? [[01:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=6896.52s)]
*  Yeah, I was like what happened dude is this are we in like the is this a war treaty or something? [[01:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=6901.6s)]

*  It was a pencil right and I was watching the leg come out. I was like this is crazy [[01:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=6912.88s)]
*  This just happened. I cannot even believe it. Yeah, it's I mean when I think about how [[01:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=6918.88s)]
*  how I think honestly it was like [[01:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=6925.84s)]
*  It was getting my tickets for this flight and I was like thinking about [[01:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=6929.4400000000005s)]
*  How there was a time when I you ordered paper tickets and they came in the mail and I had to like [[01:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=6933.24s)]
*  Carry them with you and you were all excited. Yeah. Yeah versus handphone [[01:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=6938.68s)]
*  Yeah, you got a ticket to a concert like there were certainly things that added this like there was more of a [[01:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=6942.64s)]
*  When there was more paper in the world things that there I don't know things felt a little bit more connected even when there was [[01:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=6948.88s)]
*  Like a local newspaper and stuff and you got your name in it for something or you got to see what was happening in your community [[01:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=6954.72s)]
*  It was a big deal. Like they don't have a lot of those anymore [[01:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=6960.4400000000005s)]
*  Yeah, and so a lot of just like the value of being a community [[01:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=6963.12s)]
*  That's not just like a national community feels like it's dilapidating. So I think that's true. I mean, I think that's the [[01:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=6968.4800000000005s)]
*  There's definitely [[01:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=6976.48s)]
*  degree to which people have sort of like locks themselves [[01:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=6978.719999999999s)]
*  Into their homes in ways that they're like and they think they're interacting with people right because they are online [[01:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=6982.04s)]
*  But they're not necessarily coming out and talking to their neighbors regularly. No, they're talking to their spouses or kids [[01:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=6988.679999999999s)]
*  They're all this in their room on their devices just ordering [[01:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=6995.04s)]
*  Door-dash or whatever. Yeah, like exotic pistachios or whatever like people are ordering just a lot of weird [[01:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=6999.5199999999995s)]
*  And then it just at Christmas they all meet up in the living room [[01:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=7005.639999999999s)]
*  Everybody's like wow [[01:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=7010.759999999999s)]
*  Mom grew a mustache, you know, and it's just yeah, it's just I don't know. It's a different time [[01:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=7012.5599999999995s)]

*  I'm trying to think any other things you found that you've gotten your set that you get angry at yourself for dr. Martin [[01:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=7024.5199999999995s)]
*  Um, I think some things that like the things that tend to jump out of me a lot of them are things we've talked about [[01:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=7031.58s)]
*  Like it's I get angry at myself when I don't achieve whatever I set my mind to whatever I've decided and that's true [[01:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=7036.98s)]
*  Not just with work, but it's true with like personal or fitness goals or or things like that [[01:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=7044.099999999999s)]
*  You know when I like I said, I map out pretty specific goals and then when I don't achieve those things I tend to get [[01:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=7050.099999999999s)]
*  disappointed with myself [[01:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=7057.86s)]
*  I think I tend to I've become much more [[01:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=7060.0199999999995s)]
*  relaxed over time not necessarily at work, but much more relaxed about just the [[01:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=7064.98s)]
*  My interactions with other people that I meet every and I've sort of embraced that philosophy of hey [[01:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=7069.339999999999s)]
*  everybody's dealing with something and just you know, I [[01:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=7075.719999999999s)]

*  I think because he was a trainee. Yeah, he felt the need to like do a real good job [[01:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=7136.86s)]
*  So told me no, yeah, he's like because my supervisors watching I gotta so I'm this is where why I'm telling the story is [[01:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=7142.06s)]

*  Yeah, but he did the thing where he put his hands like this any and he patted me and he and he walked me through in [[01:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=7158.860000000001s)]
*  Advance, he told me what was gonna happen. He also had to go up and down my leg. Oh, yeah [[01:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=7165.26s)]
*  That's a big one kind of yeah, it's like if you just ask me if something's on my legs, I'll tell you honestly [[01:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=7169.1s)]
*  Yeah, he that's who I am. Yeah [[01:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=7174.820000000001s)]

*  No, I really don't [[01:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=7183.740000000001s)]
*  Online yeah Craigslist [[01:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=7186.740000000001s)]
*  We met it out in the woods he wanted [[01:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=7189.860000000001s)]
*  Dude there used to be a strange encounters on Craigslist casual encounters [[01:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=7193.02s)]
*  Oh, yeah, yeah, you could go on there and just meet strangers in the middle of nowhere if you wanted to no, thanks [[01:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=7197.46s)]
*  I did it. Did you? [[02:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=7202.56s)]
*  But there was definitely some different times you just didn't know, you know, huh just gosh I [[02:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=7206.3s)]
*  I've only used Craigslist to sell stuff and we didn't meet in the woods. Okay, we just met at my house [[02:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=7213.5s)]
*  TBD brother, you know, there's more to me. There's more to know. I'm sure [[02:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=7219.8s)]
*  These your books right here while we get mad. Those are for you [[02:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=7224.400000000001s)]
*  Oh, thank you can give them away, but you got to find someone named Theo to give them to okay [[02:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=7227.68s)]
*  Because I signed them. Oh, thank you. Now they're worthless. Yeah, that's super cool [[02:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=7231.280000000001s)]
*  How to deal with angry people [[02:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=7236.040000000001s)]
*  Yeah, what do you tell people in this? Yeah, so that book it's broken into two sections [[02:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=7238.4400000000005s)]
*  It's got one that really explains where anger comes from where [[02:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=7242.88s)]
*  Why people get angry some of those angry personality types we were talking about and then it goes through like ten [[02:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=7246.6s)]
*  specific suggestions [[02:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=7252.84s)]
*  For like how you can deal with angry people when you interact with them [[02:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=7254.84s)]
*  Some of it's like how do you deal with people that you run into online some of its how do you stay calm? [[02:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=7258.56s)]
*  Part of its you know, do you do you do you consider whether or not you really screwed up? [[02:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=7263.4400000000005s)]
*  Maybe the problem is that you blew it and you need to find ways to [[02:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=7268.360000000001s)]
*  Things like that is it is apologize and ever a bad idea do you think I mean what I usually say [[02:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=7272.32s)]
*  About apologizing is that I don't think people should do it if they don't mean it. I mean, I think you should mean your apology [[02:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=7280.4s)]
*  Yeah, and I think a lot of times we you know [[02:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=7286.5599999999995s)]
*  so I [[02:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=7290.4s)]
*  I think that's a good point [[02:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=7291.96s)]
*  I think that's a good point [[02:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=7293.96s)]
*  I think that's a good point [[02:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=7295.96s)]
*  I think a lot of times we you know, so I [[02:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=7298.52s)]
*  think that [[02:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=7302.2s)]
*  One of the things we've done is by especially with kids a lot of times we force them to apologize [[02:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=7303.4s)]
*  Oh, you got to go say you're sorry and and you know [[02:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=7308.12s)]
*  I think that actually sends a message of well apologizing is what you do to get out of trouble and that isn't necessarily [[02:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=7311.68s)]
*  Why we should apologize right? We should apologize if we're really sorry [[02:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=7317.36s)]
*  I actually don't want people to apologize to me if they're not actually sorry, right? That is just a meaningless gesture [[02:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=7320.68s)]
*  And it's weird too. Yeah, they're still calling you names, but they're apologizing right, right? [[02:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=7326.200000000001s)]
*  And so like I'm sorry. I called you a name you little yes [[02:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=7331.6s)]
*  And then you're like Jesus God and it cuz so if it doesn't lead to change behavior, then what's the what's the point? [[02:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=7334.72s)]
*  Yeah, so I think so I think but [[02:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=7342.4800000000005s)]
*  The flip side of that is when a person is sorry [[02:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=7347.52s)]
*  They should apologize and they should do it [[02:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=7350.6s)]
*  Well, you know like they should they should do it effectively they should you know [[02:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=7353.12s)]
*  Tell people what they're sorry for and they should they should make amends in a way that suggests that it won't happen again [[02:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=7358.64s)]
*  And I think that's where a lot of people fall short is that it's always a I'm sorry if or I'm sorry, but [[02:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=7364.72s)]
*  Instead of just I'm sorry. Yeah, what can I do to make it up to you? [[02:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=7372.76s)]
*  That sort of thing. Mm-hmm before you go. I wanted to [[02:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=7377.12s)]
*  Want to ask you why do people why is road rage such a thing? Why is that? Yeah? [[02:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=7382.84s)]
*  Driving is just the absolute perfect scenario for for leading to anger everything about it [[02:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=7389.52s)]
*  I mean truly if you were an evil genius and you wanted to create a situation that was gonna make people mad [[02:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=7395.54s)]
*  You would create one that that looked like driving right? I gotta get from here to here. Yep [[02:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=7400.68s)]
*  I got I got goals and there's people in the way of those goals those people who are blocking them are anonymous to me [[02:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=7405.2s)]
*  So I can think or say whatever I want right I can call them a total fucking idiot. Yeah, and [[02:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=7412.14s)]
*  And and I don't know that they might be a genius and I'll have no idea [[02:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=7417.82s)]
*  You've there's all these unwritten rules of the road [[02:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=7423.26s)]
*  I mean there's written rules, but then there's also like what speed should you be going right? [[02:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=7427.22s)]
*  I mean, right so there's vagueness in there too, which can yeah [[02:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=7432.1s)]
*  So it's the thing I often ask my students is what what speed should you go on the interstate? [[02:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=7435.08s)]
*  Because nobody says you know the speed limit. It's always five over ten over fifteen over right it's and so [[02:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=7441.94s)]
*  If we have if you and I are on the road and we have different what's your answer to that? [[02:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=7448.7s)]
*  My answer probably [[02:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=7452.7s)]
*  Eleven miles over okay, so I'm pretty close to that. I'm like nine okay. I [[02:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=7454.94s)]
*  Tend to set the cruise at nine over [[02:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=7459.54s)]
*  so if [[02:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=7462.14s)]
*  If you and I encounter each other on the road and you're behind me well you get mad because I'm not obeying your [[02:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=7463.5s)]
*  You know arbitrary rule right and I get mad because you're a hazard right here trying you ride my bumper or whatever because hey [[02:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=7469.94s)]
*  I'm already going fast enough. Yeah, so these arbitrary rules set people off [[02:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=7478.26s)]
*  All of that ends up and then on top of that. It's it's kind of a nerve-racking situation [[02:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=7483.42s)]
*  We don't actually think of it [[02:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=7488.06s)]
*  We've been driving long enough that we forget how anxiety provoking it actually is that but it's dangerous right and [[02:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=7489.26s)]
*  and so like real harm can [[02:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=7496.02s)]
*  Can happen and so all of that tends to exacerbate that [[02:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=7499.1s)]
*  That that likelihood of getting angry when people slow us down or get in the way [[02:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=7504.74s)]
*  then add to it that the consequences are so significant of people [[02:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=7510.46s)]

*  Window broke there. Yeah, but it's crazy. You would think you just leave if somebody broke your window that dude [[02:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=7629.46s)]
*  Yeah, that guy or whatever these incidents are everywhere now. I mean you you scroll through something [[02:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=7634.38s)]
*  That's the part of it. So I had a weird interaction right outside my my kids school one day where [[02:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=7641.74s)]
*  I was parked waiting for pickup and this woman came and she [[02:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=7647.22s)]
*  Parked her car in front of me and she was she was backing up and I got a little anxious that she didn't realize how close [[02:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=7652.86s)]
*  She was yeah, and so I honked but it wasn't I mean to me. This is what a horn is for actually, right? [[02:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=7657.66s)]
*  It's like to alert someone like hey, you're you might hit me. Yeah, not because I was mad [[02:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=7663.42s)]
*  I wasn't but wow, it made her mad like she was really mad that I'd honked at her [[02:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=7668.98s)]
*  but what was interesting is that she got out of the car and she came over to talk to me and [[02:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=7673.32s)]
*  She immediately started recording like she took her phone out and started like videoing the situation [[02:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=7677.98s)]
*  I think thinking that we might think I might escalate things might escalate and wanting it captured if it if it did and [[02:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=7684.299999999999s)]
*  I think that like which I do wonder sometimes what is do do phones [[02:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=7691.0599999999995s)]
*  I don't have an answer to this do phones de-escalate situations or do they escalate them? [[02:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=7696.9s)]
*  You know, like if if right once the show is on now do I have to perform right? [[02:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=7701.42s)]
*  I had a soccer coach come yell at me one day [[02:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=7706.179999999999s)]
*  I'm not just me like yell at the fans at a game and I've I've often won me he was out of control [[02:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=7709.639999999999s)]
*  I've often wondered what would have happened if I just taking my phone out and start recording what he have been like [[02:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=7716.0s)]
*  Oh, I should back away or what? Yeah, that was just exacerbated. Yeah, and I don't know dude. Yeah [[02:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=7720.24s)]
*  Wow. Yeah, because that's interesting. It's almost like art imitates life or whatever [[02:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=7726.94s)]
*  it's like we're just what like if we're watching something violent happen and [[02:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=7731.719999999999s)]
*  Then we get involved in something violent the first thing to do then a lot of times wouldn't even be to help it would be [[02:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=7736.0199999999995s)]
*  To record right, right because that's what we just saw if we just saw something recorded, right? [[02:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=7742.62s)]
*  It makes me I mean I truly wonder is that I mean there must be circumstances where [[02:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=7748.42s)]
*  That's the smart thing to do where that is gonna de-escalate right? [[02:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=7754.42s)]
*  You know where people are gonna start to sort of say like oh, I don't want to be I don't want to be famous [[02:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=7758.5s)]
*  Yeah, I think if someone is probably urinating in your yard or something, then you definitely [[02:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=7763.54s)]
*  I'm gonna record you and then like oh, I'm not gonna be doing this on that camera on the right camera [[02:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=7768.5s)]
*  I'm gonna put my pants up or whatever, but I think if it's somebody who's just like I [[02:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=7773.660000000001s)]
*  Don't know. That's a good question [[02:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=7779.9400000000005s)]
*  I think part of the question is how rational are they in that moment, right? You know, I mean if they're right [[02:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=7781.34s)]
*  They might be doing it as a safety mechanism. Yep. I'm gonna make sure things don't get out of control. Right, right. Yep [[02:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=7786.46s)]
*  But yeah road rage commonly characterized by aggressive driving is a factor in more than 50% of all car crashes that end in fatality [[02:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=7791.9800000000005s)]
*  According to AAA in fact in a separate years long study road raid episodes resulted in about 30 deaths and 1,800 injuries per year [[02:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=7798.3s)]
*  This is you know, it's funny. I [[02:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=7805.74s)]
*  One of the things that I oftentimes talk to people about it's like it's the time so I did a TED talk on anger a few [[02:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=7808.3s)]
*  You have seen it back a while ago. And so like the premise of that talk is that anger is good for you. There it is [[02:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=7814.82s)]
*  That anger is like good for you in all these different ways [[02:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=7821.9s)]
*  one circumstance that I would not [[02:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=7825.26s)]
*  Advocate anger is is behind the wheel, right? [[02:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=7828.5s)]
*  It's just it feels like there's no good outcome that it just puts you in a dangerous spot and [[02:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=7831.34s)]
*  Better to better to just back away and and let it go. Yeah, let it go [[02:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=7837.860000000001s)]
*  Yeah, what are good ways that anger? What is that? When is anger healthy? Yeah, I mean, I think it's a lot of it is [[02:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=7843.62s)]
*  you know if you grant the premise that [[02:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=7849.38s)]
*  Unfairness exists in the world that there are injustices in the world and I do grant that premise then you know feeling anger [[02:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=7852.62s)]
*  as a [[02:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=7860.820000000001s)]
*  is totally natural and healthy and [[02:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=7862.700000000001s)]
*  It's what we do with it. That is that is most recently [[02:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=7865.900000000001s)]
*  anger like any emotion it exists in us for [[02:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=7870.580000000001s)]
*  Because of our evolutionary history, right it exists in us because it it [[02:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=7874.780000000001s)]
*  Encouraged our ancestors to like fight back and so it was a survival mechanism. And so from that perspective, it's still valuable [[02:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=7881.14s)]
*  So the same way, you know, I get thirsty and I [[02:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=7889.14s)]
*  Get a sip of water [[02:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=7892.7s)]
*  Anger motivates me to confront injustice, right? And you're gonna need it, too [[02:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=7894.98s)]
*  I mean if they didn't if we got rid of anger completely would be then what if there were [[02:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=7900.1s)]
*  Tyranny or something we'd never be able to stand up to it, you know, what if there were yeah [[02:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=7904.62s)]
*  I mean anger is behind all these social movements in in really meaningful ways, right? [[02:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=7909.14s)]
*  And now we were talking earlier about protests and social media that [[02:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=7913.9s)]
*  But anger is what's motivating most of those in [[02:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=7917.68s)]
*  oftentimes in in in healthy ways [[02:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=7921.8s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah [[02:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=7925.28s)]

*  Yeah [[02:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=7934.0s)]

*  By an overly aggressive TSA agent. I think we've covered a lot. That's a lot of ground [[02:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=7942.12s)]
*  Dr. Ryan Martin, thank you so much man for coming in. Yeah. Thank you, man. This has been a absolute treat [[02:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=7947.4800000000005s)]

*  It's been interesting to just learn more a little bit about anger and the thing that has helped me at times [[02:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=7958.28s)]
*  Is that moment of thinking how do I want this to play out? Yep? [[02:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=7962.64s)]
*  That's good. If I can let that get me [[02:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=7967.4800000000005s)]
*  At that moment when you're about to open the card or whatever, you know [[02:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=7970.4800000000005s)]

*  How do I want this evening to play out this afternoon this next hour this next week? Yep [[02:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=7975.84s)]
*  Yeah [[02:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=7983.52s)]
*  Yeah, I agree. I mean I think that like that has to be thinking about that outcome you want [[02:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=7984.76s)]
*  What is your desired outcome in any situation? [[02:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=7990.4400000000005s)]

*  What is the thing I have to do to? [[02:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=7999.56s)]
*  Accomplish this and and you know and now that the second piece is be having the presence of mind to [[02:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=8002.4400000000005s)]
*  Deescalate yourself in order to have that thought and be intentional about that, right? [[02:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=8010.76s)]
*  Yeah, if you can get to that thought you're probably gonna be okay, right? [[02:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=8015.4800000000005s)]
*  I've noticed that it for myself if I can get to that thought I'm probably gonna be okay because most the time I'm gonna choose [[02:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=8019.12s)]
*  Yeah, let's find a way to get this [[02:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=8024.6s)]
*  Let's find a way to just get through this [[02:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=8027.4800000000005s)]
*  Yep, and and the I think for people who have real genuine anger problems [[02:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=8029.68s)]
*  There are they're not able to get to that thought. Hmm, you know that they're so [[02:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=8034.64s)]
*  Escalated in the moment. It's this righteous anger that is driving everything they're thinking about and they're not able to [[02:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=8038.96s)]
*  To to get to the place of okay. What's the rational healthy thing to do right now? [[02:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=8046.04s)]
*  Yeah, because I think preserving your peace is really key [[02:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=8051.8s)]
*  I mean, I there's just everything is loud everywhere. There's just everything is like [[02:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=8055.3s)]
*  Signaling or letting you know [[02:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=8059.820000000001s)]
*  Notification never ending now. I think just holding on to your peace and and if you can remember that how do I want this to end? [[02:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=8061.7s)]
*  How do I really want this to end? It's really good for any situation. Honestly, it's it's good for it's good for the the small day-to-day interactions [[02:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=8068.820000000001s)]
*  It's good for big life goals. Yeah business [[02:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=8076.7s)]
*  It's like if you're calling to make a deal with somebody [[02:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=8079.66s)]
*  Maybe they don't want the deal or maybe it's not but do you want to do deals with them for the next ten years? [[02:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=8081.46s)]
*  What do you how do you want things to look long-term? Right? You know, do you need to be you know? [[02:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwe31dYRtBI&t=8085.3s)]
