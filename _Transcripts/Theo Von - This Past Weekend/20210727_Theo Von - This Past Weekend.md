*  Itchery at the house I got you know, I got a bad detergent [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiXd2E5lKwU&t=24.0s)]
*  And I don't want to call out any shops or mercantiles but um 99 cent store [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiXd2E5lKwU&t=28.64s)]
*  You know [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiXd2E5lKwU&t=39.28s)]
*  Y'all give me some they gave me some tide [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiXd2E5lKwU&t=40.56s)]
*  And it's I think tied fresh and easy [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiXd2E5lKwU&t=44.0s)]
*  I think is the package and let me [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiXd2E5lKwU&t=47.120000000000005s)]
*  Be sure of that. I don't want to [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiXd2E5lKwU&t=50.16s)]
*  Send somebody on a bad route here tied fresh [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiXd2E5lKwU&t=53.120000000000005s)]
*  And clean [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiXd2E5lKwU&t=57.12s)]
*  Is the item I'm talking about and I don't know [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiXd2E5lKwU&t=59.519999999999996s)]
*  If they just got a hot batch or something, but it's got it's got me itching everything [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiXd2E5lKwU&t=64.32s)]
*  And at first I didn't know what was happening [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiXd2E5lKwU&t=70.88s)]
*  I didn't know you could have asked me what's happening. I said it like I don't you know, I don't know. I don't know [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiXd2E5lKwU&t=75.36s)]
*  Like I don't you know, I don't know I don't know and I was seeing kind of whelps around my ankles [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiXd2E5lKwU&t=81.27999999999999s)]
*  You know and I got a little bit of fat family and uh, [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiXd2E5lKwU&t=90.16s)]
*  Sometimes a lot of sugar will gather around your ankles down in your blood [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiXd2E5lKwU&t=93.67999999999999s)]
*  You know ankles just that that's that hearty swamp knuckle that's that last hitter [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiXd2E5lKwU&t=99.83999999999999s)]
*  When you really get down to the ankle that's really [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiXd2E5lKwU&t=106.96s)]
*  I [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiXd2E5lKwU&t=109.52s)]
*  Mean damn that's the lord's u-turn at each one of your legs. That's [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiXd2E5lKwU&t=110.64s)]
*  you know [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiXd2E5lKwU&t=114.8s)]
*  That's where the stream kind of stops and rebuttals [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiXd2E5lKwU&t=116.96000000000001s)]
*  So a lot of [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiXd2E5lKwU&t=122.16s)]
*  You know, like I said, I got family that's real [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiXd2E5lKwU&t=124.88s)]
*  Got a lot of grits in them if you know what i'm saying and uh, [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiXd2E5lKwU&t=128.72s)]
*  You know, they real, you know, they hearty [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiXd2E5lKwU&t=132.8s)]
*  They hearty you crack them open. They're gonna have a couple hearts in them, man [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiXd2E5lKwU&t=136.0s)]
*  you know, they hearty and uh [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiXd2E5lKwU&t=140.0s)]
*  And so the deal is that a lot of sugar gathers there [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiXd2E5lKwU&t=142.88s)]
*  At that little turnabout at the ankle [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiXd2E5lKwU&t=147.6s)]
*  So anyway, i'm thinking maybe i'm you know, i've had some bad, uh [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiXd2E5lKwU&t=150.79999999999998s)]
*  Chamomile tea or i've had a bad [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiXd2E5lKwU&t=155.67999999999998s)]
*  Donut or something [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiXd2E5lKwU&t=158.48s)]
*  You know, maybe I had me a couple, you know, I'll put a little [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiXd2E5lKwU&t=161.44s)]
*  You know, I like ribs I like rib meat and sometimes I'll put a little too much sauce on there [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiXd2E5lKwU&t=164.39999999999998s)]
*  So really i'm having sauce and i'm just eating it with a rib [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiXd2E5lKwU&t=171.35999999999999s)]
*  You know at some point i'm i'm the the entrée is the sauce so i've been there, you know [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiXd2E5lKwU&t=176.88s)]
*  sometime at a barbecue you'll see me sitting at that last, uh [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiXd2E5lKwU&t=185.35999999999999s)]
*  At the last picnic tables [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiXd2E5lKwU&t=188.72s)]
*  And i'm just dipping a bone in the sauce, you know, i'm just going with straight marrow to mouth, honey, you know [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiXd2E5lKwU&t=191.36s)]
*  I'm just hauling sauce, man [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiXd2E5lKwU&t=196.88s)]
*  so [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiXd2E5lKwU&t=199.6s)]
*  Um, so I thought maybe I'd had too much sugar. I'd had too much barbecue sauce or it was a condiment. That was real sweet heavy [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiXd2E5lKwU&t=202.32s)]
*  That was making me have too much sugar in my body making my ankles itch [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiXd2E5lKwU&t=209.52s)]
*  And so i'm trying to adjust my diet and [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiXd2E5lKwU&t=214.8s)]
*  I keep itching [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiXd2E5lKwU&t=218.56s)]
*  and then I saw a [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiXd2E5lKwU&t=220.96s)]
*  spider [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiXd2E5lKwU&t=224.56s)]

*  Um [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiXd2E5lKwU&t=1122.6799999999998s)]
*  Which might have given you the the the I but maybe if you're if if i'm corey sanhagen [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiXd2E5lKwU&t=1123.8799999999999s)]
*  I had the idea that i'm getting maybe it gives me the idea that i'm winning more that i'm it just visually it looked like that [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiXd2E5lKwU&t=1128.9199999999998s)]
*  So I could know that maybe that would have been off you had you had um sanhagen landed more strikes [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiXd2E5lKwU&t=1136.6799999999998s)]
*  You know, he hit him with more opportunities. I mean he was just damn throwing just [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiXd2E5lKwU&t=1144.36s)]
*  You know, he was out there like a damn battle bot [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiXd2E5lKwU&t=1149.9599999999998s)]
*  Now I think the part where it gets tricky [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiXd2E5lKwU&t=1153.9599999999998s)]
*  Is that dillashaw is that pressure bear? [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiXd2E5lKwU&t=1157.8s)]
*  You know what i'm saying? He's that honey hunter man. He's the second you let him [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiXd2E5lKwU&t=1161.4799999999998s)]
*  The second you open that zoo cage he is out there mauling people [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiXd2E5lKwU&t=1167.9599999999998s)]
*  Whereas sanhagen is more that sniper [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiXd2E5lKwU&t=1172.12s)]
*  You know, he kind of works for the electric company. He'll climb up the pole and kind of see what's going on and then he'll zap you [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiXd2E5lKwU&t=1175.3999999999999s)]
*  You know, he's really that um, you know, that's kind of how he is, you know [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiXd2E5lKwU&t=1184.28s)]
*  Uh, but damn dillashaw is out there beating the damn uh diet coke out of a child's hand [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiXd2E5lKwU&t=1190.44s)]
*  He don't you know what i'm saying? He's just he's the mauler [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiXd2E5lKwU&t=1195.3999999999999s)]
*  So I think I could see if visually there's kind of two different things going on you have dillashaw controlling [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiXd2E5lKwU&t=1198.28s)]
*  You know, we kind of held corey against the cage. He had that control time [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiXd2E5lKwU&t=1205.3999999999999s)]
*  You know that time of it was almost slow dance. You almost want him to put a song on [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiXd2E5lKwU&t=1210.2s)]
*  You know put on some garth brooks or put on a little bit of a [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiXd2E5lKwU&t=1215.3999999999999s)]
*  You know, maybe some really slow kodak black or something if he's ever done a ballad [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiXd2E5lKwU&t=1219.6399999999999s)]
*  Black or something if he's ever done a ballad or some early, uh [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiXd2E5lKwU&t=1225.08s)]
*  Or some early beaver [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiXd2E5lKwU&t=1231.32s)]
*  Some early jb, you know throw that on [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiXd2E5lKwU&t=1233.96s)]
*  But the control to like it's just kind of like [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiXd2E5lKwU&t=1237.8s)]
*  I don't know. I feel like sometimes you're just holding somebody there [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiXd2E5lKwU&t=1241.32s)]
*  Now, I know we did a lot of knees to him. He really need him up [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiXd2E5lKwU&t=1245.6399999999999s)]
*  You know, we need him up like a damn, you know kind of like the way a armless man would make a damn, uh [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiXd2E5lKwU&t=1249.48s)]
*  Would kind of prepare a dough or do veal [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiXd2E5lKwU&t=1256.1999999999998s)]
*  If you got somebody with no arms the way they do veal it's just [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiXd2E5lKwU&t=1259.8799999999999s)]
*  You know what i'm saying? They need that damn little animal in the submission [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiXd2E5lKwU&t=1263.7199999999998s)]
*  Until it's ready to you know [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiXd2E5lKwU&t=1267.3999999999999s)]
*  Be a damn macaroni grill entree [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiXd2E5lKwU&t=1269.3999999999999s)]
*  Me [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiXd2E5lKwU&t=1271.5s)]
*  But I just feel like and and so you had san hagen, uh [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiXd2E5lKwU&t=1274.06s)]
*  You had dillashaw pushed about he pushed about he came at him [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiXd2E5lKwU&t=1279.58s)]
*  But I don't think there's anything wrong with backing away from a guy to get into the position that you want the most [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiXd2E5lKwU&t=1283.34s)]
*  You know if a bee's coming at you [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiXd2E5lKwU&t=1290.94s)]
*  You don't just [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiXd2E5lKwU&t=1294.14s)]
*  Attack the beat you kind of reposition yourself [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiXd2E5lKwU&t=1295.9s)]
*  You move around [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiXd2E5lKwU&t=1299.42s)]
*  You might circle the block [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiXd2E5lKwU&t=1301.66s)]
*  You may put a mannequin out there that's dressed like you and then sneak around [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiXd2E5lKwU&t=1303.82s)]
*  Watch the bee see what it's doing and then come back at it [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiXd2E5lKwU&t=1308.14s)]
*  But [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiXd2E5lKwU&t=1312.62s)]
*  I don't think there's anything wrong with just [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiXd2E5lKwU&t=1314.94s)]
*  Reposition yourself if you look at how what san hagen did against, uh, frankie edgars who I love [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiXd2E5lKwU&t=1317.0s)]
*  Dear god, man. I wish he was my godfather if I could be [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiXd2E5lKwU&t=1324.14s)]
*  You know if I could climb back in my mother's vagina and you know email frankie before I would see if he would do that [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiXd2E5lKwU&t=1327.34s)]
*  For me, but san hagen did that against egory kind of just backed up and moved him into position [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiXd2E5lKwU&t=1333.02s)]
*  So you have to respect that just because a guy is kind of retreating [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiXd2E5lKwU&t=1338.54s)]
*  That can be strategy [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiXd2E5lKwU&t=1344.3s)]
*  So I thought it was really close [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiXd2E5lKwU&t=1348.46s)]
*  Um [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiXd2E5lKwU&t=1351.18s)]
*  I think it's interesting when a sport is also a business [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiXd2E5lKwU&t=1353.3400000000001s)]
*  There's going to become moments where if you let it be too close [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiXd2E5lKwU&t=1358.54s)]
*  That the business can [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiXd2E5lKwU&t=1363.98s)]
*  Help determine [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiXd2E5lKwU&t=1368.78s)]
*  What the future looks like [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiXd2E5lKwU&t=1371.5s)]
*  And it's a great look for the uh weight class. It's a great look for [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiXd2E5lKwU&t=1374.3s)]
*  Ufc [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiXd2E5lKwU&t=1379.56s)]
*  You know dillashaw was [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiXd2E5lKwU&t=1383.4199999999998s)]
*  you know, they kind of it almost felt like [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiXd2E5lKwU&t=1386.3799999999999s)]
*  San hagen had to prove himself more than dillashaw had to prove himself [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiXd2E5lKwU&t=1390.6799999999998s)]
*  So, I don't know if some of the judges went into it with uh, you know with that sort of mindset in the beginning [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiXd2E5lKwU&t=1397.26s)]
*  But I feel like the outcome was better for the business [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiXd2E5lKwU&t=1404.3s)]
*  And also look what do I know nothing [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiXd2E5lKwU&t=1408.86s)]
*  i'm a one stripe white belt that hasn't been in class in almost a month because I [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiXd2E5lKwU&t=1411.82s)]
*  My ribs kept getting fractured by women and men and women [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiXd2E5lKwU&t=1416.1399999999999s)]
*  But um [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiXd2E5lKwU&t=1422.2199999999998s)]
*  So I think that it was a great [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiXd2E5lKwU&t=1423.74s)]
*  It looks it's great for the business suddenly you got dillashaw's back in there and uh [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiXd2E5lKwU&t=1425.9799999999998s)]
*  You know, he's back in the in the bout structure [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiXd2E5lKwU&t=1431.34s)]
*  So you're going to get more fights out of him san hagen's still young, you know [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiXd2E5lKwU&t=1434.3s)]
*  He can you know, he'll be able to meander around in there before [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiXd2E5lKwU&t=1437.9s)]
*  Uh, you know, he'll be able to you know [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiXd2E5lKwU&t=1441.82s)]
*  You could insert him back in for that title shot whenever [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiXd2E5lKwU&t=1444.78s)]
*  Maybe you run it back [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiXd2E5lKwU&t=1449.26s)]
*  I don't know. I just don't see [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiXd2E5lKwU&t=1452.7s)]
*  I see how if i'm the business if i'm the business, uh, then I give it to dillashaw [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiXd2E5lKwU&t=1454.86s)]
*  But if i'm a judge I side with how anthony smith said it, you know the lion-hearted one [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiXd2E5lKwU&t=1460.88s)]
*  He said it after the show. He said I had it for one, uh [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiXd2E5lKwU&t=1466.5600000000002s)]
*  san hagen's [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiXd2E5lKwU&t=1470.16s)]
*  And that's how I had it man [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiXd2E5lKwU&t=1471.68s)]
*  I had san hagen's winning now brennan shaw would disagree with me but [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiXd2E5lKwU&t=1473.68s)]
*  Oh well [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiXd2E5lKwU&t=1479.6000000000001s)]
*  I don't have to agree with him all the time if I don't want to or anyone [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiXd2E5lKwU&t=1481.2s)]
*  And look, I don't know what i'm talking about [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiXd2E5lKwU&t=1485.3600000000001s)]
*  but [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiXd2E5lKwU&t=1487.8400000000001s)]
*  I believe I know what I saw [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiXd2E5lKwU&t=1488.96s)]
*  And I believe that corey san hagen did enough to win [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiXd2E5lKwU&t=1491.3600000000001s)]
*  So [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiXd2E5lKwU&t=1496.88s)]
*  What else man? What else do we have going on out here in the world? Uh, I [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiXd2E5lKwU&t=1498.32s)]
*  What else did I do? [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiXd2E5lKwU&t=1503.28s)]
*  Yeah, that john chris episode is just it's a good one [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiXd2E5lKwU&t=1505.6000000000001s)]
*  you know, we talked a lot about [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiXd2E5lKwU&t=1509.76s)]
*  sex addiction and just [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiXd2E5lKwU&t=1511.8400000000001s)]
*  Why we kind of [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiXd2E5lKwU&t=1515.6000000000001s)]
*  What young men are [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiXd2E5lKwU&t=1518.56s)]
*  How our early lives shape [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiXd2E5lKwU&t=1521.1999999999998s)]
*  How we interact? [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiXd2E5lKwU&t=1523.84s)]
*  with affection [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiXd2E5lKwU&t=1526.24s)]
*  As we grow older [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiXd2E5lKwU&t=1528.56s)]
*  Um [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiXd2E5lKwU&t=1534.08s)]
*  and john was really forthright talking about his journey and his struggles and [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiXd2E5lKwU&t=1535.36s)]
*  And sometimes you know, we get in the struggle space where it's like [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiXd2E5lKwU&t=1540.8799999999999s)]
*  Once you enter the struggle space you you kind of think everything is a struggle [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiXd2E5lKwU&t=1545.04s)]
*  And I recognize that you know [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiXd2E5lKwU&t=1551.52s)]
*  Sometimes things just are what they are. It's not necessarily a struggle. It's not necessarily a [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiXd2E5lKwU&t=1555.6799999999998s)]
*  A bonus or a bravado or a positive. It's just is what it is [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiXd2E5lKwU&t=1562.3999999999999s)]
*  um [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiXd2E5lKwU&t=1570.96s)]
*  But it was interesting man. We talked about the first time you ever eject out of your body [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiXd2E5lKwU&t=1572.72s)]
*  The first time you let that you know, you let god's trout just kind of fly out of your body out of you out of your body [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiXd2E5lKwU&t=1580.8s)]
*  And what that was like and the feeling from it [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiXd2E5lKwU&t=1591.3600000000001s)]
*  You know, I think I felt real ashamed the first time I really just sprayed out [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiXd2E5lKwU&t=1596.96s)]
*  I [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiXd2E5lKwU&t=1603.68s)]
*  Felt ashamed man [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiXd2E5lKwU&t=1605.28s)]
*  I felt excited and fired up. I felt like I had [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiXd2E5lKwU&t=1608.4s)]
*  It's almost like your thumb wrestling and you really win against yourself and one of your thumbs is [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiXd2E5lKwU&t=1612.32s)]
*  You know your pain is your wiener [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiXd2E5lKwU&t=1618.08s)]
*  Body wiener, you know, I remember being young and I found some liquor and some uh, titty mags, you know titty [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiXd2E5lKwU&t=1620.88s)]
*  You know literature titty literature [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiXd2E5lKwU&t=1629.1200000000001s)]
*  And I was up on his shelving unit. I climbed up there and found me a little the little jack stack [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiXd2E5lKwU&t=1633.3600000000001s)]
*  You know my brother had something [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiXd2E5lKwU&t=1637.68s)]
*  And he'd been touching himself and I didn't know it [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiXd2E5lKwU&t=1640.64s)]
*  And I shouldn't know it there's only you know, we had four children now if we got up to seven children [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiXd2E5lKwU&t=1645.2s)]
*  Then maybe we could have started writing a little note leaving notes for each other. But we was at four children in our household [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiXd2E5lKwU&t=1650.32s)]
*  And I just remember a pleasure in myself and then [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiXd2E5lKwU&t=1657.68s)]

*  Super academic in how they converse how they talk [[01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiXd2E5lKwU&t=3692.44s)]
*  I mean they know different things sure but my daughter knows things that she doesn't know and and she knows things that [[01:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiXd2E5lKwU&t=3695.08s)]
*  My daughter doesn't know but you neither feel like they know less or more, you know [[01:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiXd2E5lKwU&t=3700.28s)]
*  Like they don't know anything compared to the other right fascinating. Yeah, that sounds pretty fascinating. It's almost like an experiment in some ways [[01:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiXd2E5lKwU&t=3704.52s)]
*  That's what remi told me [[01:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiXd2E5lKwU&t=3711.56s)]
*  I'm the first phd and I was like man. I always wanted to do more but you know [[01:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiXd2E5lKwU&t=3713.56s)]
*  This is this is what i'm doing now and he's like you're living the experiment [[01:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiXd2E5lKwU&t=3717.72s)]
*  Yeah, it sounds pretty magical. I think they must be really proud of you. Is it is it uh, [[01:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiXd2E5lKwU&t=3721.64s)]
*  It must be really does it feel kind of empowering or does it feel exhausting to have to be like the teacher and the mom and everything? [[01:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiXd2E5lKwU&t=3726.36s)]
*  kind of [[01:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiXd2E5lKwU&t=3732.28s)]
*  No, I would say empowering. I mean sometimes it's it's a lot sometimes but it's a lot [[01:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiXd2E5lKwU&t=3733.56s)]
*  I would say in a good way, especially as they get older and you can really see [[01:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiXd2E5lKwU&t=3738.6s)]
*  the things [[01:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiXd2E5lKwU&t=3742.12s)]
*  That I had hoped would happen are happening, you know when they're toddlers and you're like god [[01:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiXd2E5lKwU&t=3743.4s)]
*  I hope this is gonna work out [[01:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiXd2E5lKwU&t=3746.92s)]
*  I know and all these other people are doing different things and they're like, oh no, that's totally gonna be bad [[01:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiXd2E5lKwU&t=3748.52s)]
*  because my kids don't they didn't learn to read early and [[01:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiXd2E5lKwU&t=3752.2799999999997s)]
*  And my daughter as I say now she's 13 and she's reading, you know [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiXd2E5lKwU&t=3756.44s)]
*  All the big thick, you know teen books whatever from the libraries and everything and [[01:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiXd2E5lKwU&t=3760.3599999999997s)]
*  But she didn't learn to read until she was 10 and the people that were just breathing down [[01:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiXd2E5lKwU&t=3764.8399999999997s)]
*  I'm like, she's not gonna learn to read and I was like no i've done my research and this is gonna work and [[01:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiXd2E5lKwU&t=3768.12s)]
*  And she got she reads perfectly. She reads brilliantly and she has no baggage about that [[01:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiXd2E5lKwU&t=3773.08s)]
*  She didn't learn to read when she was six or five or four or anything [[01:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiXd2E5lKwU&t=3777.16s)]
*  And so it's it's it's empowering when it works [[01:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiXd2E5lKwU&t=3781.7999999999997s)]
*  It's kind of a little bit scary when when you're doing it and you're like, well, I hope this is gonna work [[01:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiXd2E5lKwU&t=3784.6s)]
*  Yeah, I bet dang. That's cool though. I'm glad to see i'm glad to hear that it's working out. Uh, it really sounds like [[01:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiXd2E5lKwU&t=3789.96s)]
*  Yeah, it sounds like um fun [[01:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiXd2E5lKwU&t=3796.68s)]
*  It is you know, it is it is it's it is you have to I feel like to really embrace it you have to be pretty [[01:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiXd2E5lKwU&t=3800.68s)]
*  Um [[01:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiXd2E5lKwU&t=3808.6s)]
*  Just have fun with them [[01:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiXd2E5lKwU&t=3810.3599999999997s)]
*  Like I kind of just they just kind of do what they want. I i'm not relaxed like and we live near a river [[01:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiXd2E5lKwU&t=3811.48s)]
*  So we go swimming all the time like we walk over to the river and we swim and and you and I know my kids think [[01:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiXd2E5lKwU&t=3816.92s)]
*  I'm really casual because they don't wear life jackets and they can all swim and they're swimming the current [[01:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiXd2E5lKwU&t=3821.08s)]
*  It's a strong current. I mean it's not why but it's but the other day my one son [[01:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiXd2E5lKwU&t=3825.4s)]
*  He's eight and he wasn't paying attention and he just got swept a bit farther down [[01:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiXd2E5lKwU&t=3829.2400000000002s)]
*  And then I was like getting and his sister pulled and it was like it was fun [[01:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiXd2E5lKwU&t=3833.4s)]
*  I would have gone and got him but he sort of [[01:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiXd2E5lKwU&t=3837.4s)]
*  Was then horrified that I kind of like actually came down on him because most of them I don't like I don't get that [[01:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiXd2E5lKwU&t=3839.4s)]
*  We I I live by a philosophy of we have very few rules but the rules we have are [[01:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiXd2E5lKwU&t=3844.7599999999998s)]
*  Absolute, you know, you don't ever but pretty much everything else, you know, we're like you can bend on those things [[01:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiXd2E5lKwU&t=3849.08s)]
*  I I don't force many things [[01:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiXd2E5lKwU&t=3855.48s)]
*  but [[01:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiXd2E5lKwU&t=3858.2s)]
*  The it was kind of a wake-up call and then I think he maybe was a little bit more aware that I'm [[01:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiXd2E5lKwU&t=3859.16s)]
*  Actually as casual as I appeared [[01:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiXd2E5lKwU&t=3863.32s)]
*  I think well, I think some people you know the overprotective [[01:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiXd2E5lKwU&t=3866.12s)]
*  Well, yeah [[01:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiXd2E5lKwU&t=3869.64s)]
