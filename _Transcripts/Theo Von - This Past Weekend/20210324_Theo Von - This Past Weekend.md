Theo sits down with mid-sized animal control man, Marty Voiers, to learn what a day in the life of a wild animal wrangler is like. Marty tells us insane stories of being face-to-face with bobcats, just how sneaky these raccoons truly are and his thoughts on being the middle man between man and beast.

# Mid-Sized Animal Control Man  This Past Weekend w Theo Von #330
**Theo Von - This Past Weekend:** [March 24, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg)
*  Today's guest is an outdoorsman and indoorsman to hell if the animals have gotten indoors. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=0.0s)]
*  And he is, well he's a mid-sized animal control man. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=7.12s)]
*  And he can handle anything from, you know, I'm going to go on from mouse to bobcat style. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=13.68s)]
*  That includes woodpecker, flying squirrel, deer, hornet beaver, coyote, skunk, bats, and more. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=19.44s)]
*  That's this man. His company is titled Hawk Predator and Wildlife Control. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=29.84s)]
*  He has been in the game for a while since he was a child and animals were bothering him. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=37.6s)]
*  And now he bothers them. He's the dog the bounty hunter of mid-sized animals. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=43.2s)]
*  Ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Marty Voyers. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=52.879999999999995s)]
*  Mr. Vermin, do you need energy drink? [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=89.28s)]
*  I drink a lot of coffee. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=92.80000000000001s)]
*  Do you? [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=94.08000000000001s)]
*  Well I drink Mountain Dew, Diet Mountain Dew. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=94.72s)]
*  Okay, yeah. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=96.64s)]
*  I'm on a no-card kick. I've lost. I went from 260 down to 238 two days ago. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=97.28s)]
*  So I'm trying to get some weight back off. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=102.16000000000001s)]
*  Oh really? [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=104.16000000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=104.80000000000001s)]
*  And what are you leaning up for? To hunt animal? [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=105.12s)]
*  Oh, just to, I don't, to get rid of that. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=107.44000000000001s)]
*  Oh, see, oh okay. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=110.48s)]
*  Kind of hard to get through a crawl space and through an attic door if you're big as hell. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=111.12s)]
*  Well every space is a damn crawl space when you're big, huh? [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=115.68s)]
*  I guess. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=117.92s)]
*  Do we, is this, I mean, are you cussing? I don't know. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=118.88s)]
*  Oh yeah, we can say whatever you want. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=123.12s)]
*  Okay, I just don't want to. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=124.32000000000001s)]
*  No, I appreciate it, man. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=125.84s)]
*  I don't want to say something I shouldn't say. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=126.64s)]
*  Oh yeah, the only things I don't say in here usually are, I don't say, I guess, [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=128.88s)]
*  I don't say the N-word. I don't say like F-A-G-G-O-T. I don't say that. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=136.0s)]
*  And I don't say, I don't say like a lot of British curse words like C-U-N-T. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=141.36s)]
*  I don't say that. I don't say P-U-S-S-Y. I don't say, [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=146.64s)]
*  all right. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=152.24s)]
*  Like Labia. I don't say stuff like that. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=152.72s)]
*  I don't say none of that anyway. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=154.08s)]
*  Okay, yeah, but anything else is good. Or it's fine, you know, it's not good, [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=155.92s)]
*  but it is whatever you want it to be. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=159.28s)]
*  I've watched some of your, I've tried to study and watched some of your podcast. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=161.12s)]
*  Well, I don't know if that's good or not, man. I mean, all of it's a little bit different, [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=166.0s)]
*  you know. I think, you know, first of all, I appreciate you coming in. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=168.96s)]
*  How do you say your name so I know what I'm saying? [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=171.6s)]
*  Marty. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=173.84s)]
*  Okay. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=174.64s)]
*  Voyeurs. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=175.28s)]
*  Voyeurs. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=176.08s)]
*  Think, this is more than one peeping Tom. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=176.88s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=179.84s)]
*  Voyeurs. You have a voyeur or you have a voyeur? [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=180.64000000000001s)]
*  Oh, yeah, we had voyeurs usually where I'm from. We had, I remember we had to, if you wanted to [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=183.36s)]
*  go out Tom and or P-Tom and they called it, you had to get a ladder from a guy because [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=188.88s)]
*  nobody around us had a ladder. So we'd go over there and say, look, Wednesday, [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=193.44s)]
*  you know, about 4.35 PM, we want that ladder, you know. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=196.48s)]
*  And we'd get out there and peep in time. And I actually, [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=201.68s)]
*  I enjoy, I mean, as a kid, it was, you know, [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=204.56s)]
*  Where is this at? You're doing this? [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=206.88s)]
*  This, I'm from Louisiana. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=208.32s)]
*  Louisiana, okay. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=209.44s)]
*  So it reminded me of, we didn't have cable for a while. So I know you'd go over to some [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=210.32s)]
*  people's house and it was like watching, it was like watching television almost, you know, [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=214.4s)]
*  the windows even shaped like a dang television. So I remember sitting out there and just, you know, [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=218.32s)]
*  you know, the show isn't that good. It's just a family eating damn, [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=223.68s)]
*  you know, TV dinners and stuff, but it was still local programming, I guess. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=226.48s)]
*  But that's just a way to, I mean, I don't like to say that my dad cringes when I do that, [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=231.2s)]
*  but for somebody that didn't know how to pronounce my name, it's [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=235.2s)]
*  Voyeurs. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=237.76s)]
*  Voyeurs. Yeah, it's French. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=238.16s)]
*  So there you go. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=239.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=240.56s)]
*  And that's the only thing I just, I mean, on the youth is, I mean, I just don't like, [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=241.35999999999999s)]
*  because some people don't want to talk about, I say, oh yeah, if they're like, [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=245.28s)]
*  are you going to relocate him? I'm like, well, I'm going to take care of him. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=248.0s)]
*  That's, you know, I make the customer feel good. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=250.56s)]
*  Well, some animals, you gotta have to. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=253.2s)]
*  You relocate them to the Lord. You know what I'm saying? Like that's how I kind of see it. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=254.88s)]
*  You know, some of them, that's life, you know? [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=258.48s)]
*  Well, I mean, look, it's an interesting job you have. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=261.44s)]
*  So your name is French, I guess, and the French are notorious fur trappers, aren't they? [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=263.68s)]
*  Is that true or not? [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=269.36s)]
*  I guess they're fur trappers. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=270.40000000000003s)]
*  They are. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=271.6s)]
*  Do you feel that in your genetics ever? [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=271.92s)]
*  Well, I'm a fur, I'm a trap. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=273.84000000000003s)]
*  Oh, you do? [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=275.68s)]
*  Oh yeah. I sent them guys a ton of pics. I run a winter trap line, predator trap line. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=276.24s)]
*  Oh wow. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=282.32s)]
*  This year I ended up with 66 coyotes and four bobcats and a lot of other miscellaneous animals, [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=282.64s)]
*  foxes and raccoons. But I do that every year in the wintertime, starting in November to February [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=288.8s)]
*  28th. And it's, it's for, I'm slow. My business is slow in the winter and my farming is none in the [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=295.12s)]
*  winter, just the fact of feeding cattle and a fur trap. And I go and that helps my business. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=301.84s)]
*  And I do a lot in the wintertime. I'll do it for free. You know, I tell if you got coyote [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=307.03999999999996s)]
*  problems, I'll come take care of your coyotes and I'll do it for free. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=310.88s)]
*  Okay. So when you're dealing with a coyote, take me through that process. So somebody calls you and [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=314.08s)]
*  says, Hey bucko, we got a coyote out here. We got something. What's the usual complaint if they don't [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=320.08s)]
*  know that it's a coyote or that it's getting her, uh, they have something killing their calves. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=325.28s)]
*  Okay. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=329.76s)]
*  Which more than likely it's usually something the calf dies and the coyote is seen eating on it [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=330.32s)]
*  or tracks and he gets to blame. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=335.76s)]
*  Oh damn. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=337.52s)]
*  But I mean, they will, they'll get a newborn. They'll get a calf. Why cows having it? [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=338.56s)]
*  It's like the she's defenseless. I didn't mean to cut. She's defenseless when it's coming out of her [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=341.92s)]
*  and they'll sometimes they'll grab it then. She can't defend them. She can't fight, [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=347.12s)]
*  defend them and they'll eat the after birth, but they'll come after a sick, no nature. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=351.76s)]
*  They'll come after something sick. You know, if it's injured or sick, they'll come after it. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=355.68s)]
*  But, uh, you know, I get a lot of calls for that. Rating chicken houses, [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=359.92s)]
*  chicken coops or their ducks missing. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=363.12s)]
*  Oh yeah. That's just like on that cartoon. Remember that? [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=365.04s)]
*  Um, was in that cartoon where was always in the hen house. I'm trying to think of what it was. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=367.91999999999996s)]
*  That one with the big rooster. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=373.59999999999997s)]
*  Oh, I, um, you know, I'm talking about a little bit. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=376.0s)]
*  Yeah. The, the big head, the little drink. He had to bit the, I say, yeah, yeah. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=378.56s)]
*  I had a little, the little, yeah, yeah, yeah. You're running around a little, [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=382.64s)]
*  little itty bitty chicken. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=386.4s)]
*  These fellows right here. Yeah. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=387.52s)]
*  Falkhorn leg horn. Yeah. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=389.35999999999996s)]
*  And Falkhorn leg horn. I think that's Dutch, that name. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=391.84s)]
*  But yeah, he was in new, uh, yeah, he always had some ratio. Yeah. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=394.08s)]
*  It was something breaking in. So for coyotes, so, so that's fascinating. So [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=398.88s)]
*  we're talking to Mr. Boyers here and you deal with all types of [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=404.15999999999997s)]
*  basically animalia that are problems, right? [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=407.91999999999996s)]
*  Yes, sir. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=410.15999999999997s)]
*  Okay. And so I want to get immediately back into that coyote question because that's just, [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=410.64s)]
*  so is it kind of crazy to think that they'll attack during the birth, huh? [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=415.52s)]
*  Yeah, they'll, they'll, they'll go after a cow or an animal deer cow. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=420.32s)]
*  They're having their young, they're defenseless and they'll, [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=425.2s)]
*  they'll try to go after them. The ending cases, um, deer, the fawn, [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=428.08s)]
*  that's one of their main predators is coyote. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=432.56s)]
*  They'll for the mortality rate for a baby deer, it's a fawn, his coyotes. Um, [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=435.44s)]
*  they'll get the animals when they're weak, sick, and just kind of mother nature help, [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=440.8s)]
*  help them clean up and they'll, they'll get one when it's sick, take it out. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=444.71999999999997s)]
*  And do you see that as like, it's almost like that's like mother nature doing, or do you feel [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=448.8s)]
*  like that, that's like, damn, it's kind of cheating or do you feel like that's kind of just the way [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=453.12s)]
*  that mother nature works? I mean, you have something, it's like not going to make it through [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=456.56s)]
*  the winter. It's going to starve to death. Mother nature's taking out something to feed the other [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=460.40000000000003s)]
*  and it's not going to suffer. It's, it's mother nature. Yeah. But I mean, it's sometimes mother [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=465.6s)]
*  nature's cruel. She's very cruel sometimes, but she is, she's really step mother nature almost. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=469.68s)]
*  Yeah. There you go. I feel like, you know, I mean, I love my step-bobs. I got a great step-bobs though. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=475.04s)]
*  I've got a great mother and a great step-bobs. Oh, you do? Oh yeah. Oh, you, [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=482.08s)]
*  oh, your dad picked some good ones, huh? Oh yeah. I love my parents. They're the best. They raised [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=485.28000000000003s)]
*  me up good and they're the best. So now did you, were you in the dealing with animals at a young [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=488.8s)]
*  age? Because if you're a real animal man, then you, I'm guessing you really got into animal, [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=494.08000000000004s)]
*  you're pretty young, huh? My grandfather got me into trapping when I grew up on, grew up going [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=499.12s)]
*  over to the farm every weekend when I was a youngster and he got me in a trap and groundhogs [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=503.52s)]
*  getting rid of the groundhogs and started trapping there and just worked my way up over the years. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=508.24s)]
*  And he bought me my first traps at the feed store and it just worked up over time. And what kind of [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=512.56s)]
*  traps were those, those first traps? My first traps were one and a half leg holds, like foot traps. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=517.6s)]
*  Bring that up, son. I just want to see what that looks like. So we got an idea of it. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=524.24s)]
*  So now tell me how this thing works here. How does this kind of trap work? [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=528.9599999999999s)]
*  Uh, it's a spring trap. You, when you compress the sides of whichever one you're looking, [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=533.5999999999999s)]
*  we're looking at, you compress the sides of it and it's got a latch and a pan. And when you get, [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=539.4399999999999s)]
*  when you latch the pan and then you'll cover it up, I bed the trap, you bed the trap down, cover it [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=545.3599999999999s)]
*  up. Sometimes I make a bait hole. Sometimes I don't or it's a walk through set and or if it's [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=550.3199999999999s)]
*  a groundhog, you know, I'll place it down in the, in the den for the groundhog. I don't use that [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=557.52s)]
*  method in my business, but growing up trapping, that's how I got rid of the groundhog. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=561.68s)]
*  And now why would you do, so, so when you say bedding, you put like a leaves and stuff over [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=565.76s)]
*  some kind of camo? In essence, I, I bed the trap down to where they don't see it. Okay. I kind of [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=570.56s)]
*  dig out, you kind of dig out a hole you and you place a trap down, covered up to where they walk [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=574.9599999999999s)]
*  in. They don't see it, but they step on it and they're going after, like if it's a, a coyote [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=580.16s)]
*  or a predator, I use a bait hole, which I'll make a dig a little hole in the ground and put a lure, [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=584.72s)]
*  commercial lure bait in it. So the coyote's concentrating on that and we'll dig it out [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=590.0s)]
*  and then get the trap while he's working the set, going after the bait. Okay. So what kind of bait [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=595.12s)]
*  do you use? So for groundhog, you won't use a bait. You'll kind of just wait for their weight to hit [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=600.64s)]
*  it. Well, I mean, if you loot now, I don't, and in my younger, when I was a kid, I'd use a leg [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=604.4s)]
*  hole trap. But if I'm at a customer's house, can't really use a, a foothold trap in somebody's front [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=609.28s)]
*  yard. I have a, we use a good cage as I use as a comm stock cage, a double door cage. And I'll set [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=614.72s)]
*  it, bed it in front, set it in front of the hole and make it a posit to where when the groundhog [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=622.64s)]
*  comes out, he has to go in that trap. He has no option but to go in there to get outside. So that [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=627.76s)]
*  way I can say I catch three groundhogs and we don't catch anything for a week. I can say there's no [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=632.88s)]
*  more groundhogs in that hole and then we can seal the hole up and we're done. So this trap right [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=638.72s)]
*  here, this is a single door trap you said? Yes, sir. It's double door, single door, but comm stock. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=644.1600000000001s)]
*  It's one of my favorite traps. One of the most popular traps with the wild nuisance wildlife [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=648.72s)]
*  operators. So that's just pretty basic. It looks like it has like kind of this, uh, like almost a [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=653.2s)]
*  teeter totter door where once you go through it, it just closes back and you can't get out. It's [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=657.36s)]
*  spring loaded door on it and it's got the triggers in the middle. So when raccoon groundhog comes [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=661.36s)]
*  through, he hits those triggers in the middle and it's a spring loaded door and it's not like a [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=666.4s)]
*  tractor supply cage trap. It's spring loaded. It goes down, it goes down hard enough to where if one [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=672.0799999999999s)]
*  gets caught in it could kill it underneath of it. It could get it. Wow. Okay. So what animal, honestly, [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=676.72s)]
*  when you see an animal that and you trap one, which one is seem like the happiest to get trapped? Is [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=682.64s)]
*  there any that's like, thank God for getting me out of this thing. Oh, no, no, we're very happy. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=687.36s)]
*  Really? No. Um, cause some of them, I wonder sometimes if there's animals out there that are [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=691.04s)]
*  ready to be domesticated and then it's like, praise God coming to somebody, take me out of [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=695.6s)]
*  this damn food chain, you know, because I'm sure for some animals, it is just, it's a, it's a dirty [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=700.24s)]
*  world out there. Probably the most laid back creature that we trapped from the die trap is [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=705.9200000000001s)]
*  probably a possum wise. I mean, it'll, you come up to it. If it's in a cage, it'll be curled up asleep [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=710.0s)]
*  usually playing possum or if it's in a, I'll have them get into my trap when I'm predator trap and [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=716.24s)]
*  you can catch anything in these traps. I know anything, um, a possum's a scavenger. Okay. I [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=723.2s)]
*  call them ground buzzards. What I call them. They don't eat anything dead or whatever on the ground. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=729.2800000000001s)]
*  Oh yeah. For a shrimp. They call them sometimes. Yeah. And they'll, I mean, I've had them, [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=734.08s)]
*  I mean, it sounds nasty. The dead cow I'll set sometimes around it and I've seen them cut. They'll [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=738.88s)]
*  go in, they'll eat your way inside of the cow. And how do they get in through like the butt? [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=744.08s)]
*  Really? Yeah. Through the, through the rear end. They eat their way right in. I mean, it's kind of [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=748.4000000000001s)]
*  gross, but when you deal with, I mean, when you're dealing with the, I mean, it didn't really bother [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=752.24s)]
*  you, but that's, I raised cattle too. I've been around cattle all my life. That's, that's just [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=757.36s)]
*  part of mother nature. When you, my, the old way we did it, you know, you dragged the cow to the [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=761.36s)]
*  holler and let mother nature consume it. Yeah. Give back, give back to her, let her consume. Yeah. No, [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=765.52s)]
*  now you should take it, you know, really to the landfill, but we usually have a holler dig a hole [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=771.28s)]
*  with loader, maybe tractor loader and bury it, cover it up. Wow. But they're one back to a possum. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=777.2s)]
*  To get them, they're the most docile. I mean, I can, you can catch him. I can pick them up and [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=783.0400000000001s)]
*  hold them. They're mainly their main defense is they, they snarl, which they show those teeth, [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=787.2s)]
*  don't they? Yeah. It's a lot of them call them greeners. So right before you hit them, right [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=793.5200000000001s)]
*  before they get run over, they grin real big at you. Cause that's their main defense. They just [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=798.0s)]
*  grin and hiss at you to scare you away. Oh, damn. They can't fight or do it. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=801.6s)]
*  You can't, but they can't defend themselves anyway. And that's what, and they are actually [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=807.6800000000001s)]
*  marsupial marsupial. And they're, I mean, they're rather cool. They had the pouch like a kangaroo. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=811.6s)]
*  I mean, they're a really neat animal. Wow. So, so, uh, they have the pouch. Can you bring up that [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=816.24s)]
*  pouch on? So they have the pouch. It's, uh, I didn't know that, um, that they had that. Yeah. Yes, sir. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=821.36s)]
*  Yep. They carry their, they carry their young in a pouch. And now can you get like, is there like, [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=828.5600000000001s)]
*  uh, do you know how many they could fit in there? No, I, I mean, I did later probably five or six [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=834.1600000000001s)]
*  about an average litter. Okay. But I mean, they, they'll stay in there to whether so till they get [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=840.1600000000001s)]
*  so big, Nate, no, it's obviously too big. Then they'll stay with her right on her bike. Like you [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=844.72s)]
*  got the pictures. Okay. But they're, I mean, they're the most, they're a pretty gentle creature other [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=848.8000000000001s)]
*  than, you know, raccoon, not happy to see a coyote, not very happy. Even a groundhog, not happy to [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=853.84s)]
*  know. Really? They'll chatter their teeth. They'll grab, they'll bite your teeth at you. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=859.52s)]
*  I don't just like a little noise, try to scare you. That's their defense. That's everything. The skunk [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=863.6s)]
*  sprays, um, raccoon just mean they'll just come after you. Now tell me this, sir, is the, um, [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=868.72s)]

*  When does it go from pest to vermin to when it is a swamp thing or whatever your house? [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=892.64s)]
*  When, you know, raccoons are, I mean, they don't bother you in nature. You know, you, you see [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=897.9200000000001s)]
*  raccoons all the time in the road or running around. They're not a pest until they make their way in [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=903.44s)]
*  your house. They get in your attic to go through your soft food or chimney or whatever and get into [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=908.1600000000001s)]

*  you get that dumped out to you. Not what you want to do. I had a bad attack. Me, I was trying to make [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=952.5600000000001s)]
*  out with a girl. I was about 14 in an attic and, uh, and I don't know if this bat knew her or what, [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=956.72s)]
*  but that thing came after me boy. That might've been her honor for dad had passed and this was, [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=962.8s)]
*  it was a spirit. Yeah. Come back as a damn bat boy. But this thing did not want me putting my [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=969.1999999999999s)]
*  fangs in her neck. That's for sure. You were just in his house. You're invading his area. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=975.3599999999999s)]
*  I probably was. Yeah. You know, we wandered up into an attic of a semi, uh, not abandoned house, [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=979.92s)]
*  but a house that hadn't even been built yet. So pre abandonment. Um, now raccoons though, get the, [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=984.8s)]
*  they really, I feel like kind of get the, they get looked at. I feel like as mother nature is [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=992.24s)]
*  kind of hit man a little bit. They really have come into their own as being just burglars. You [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=997.92s)]
*  know, like I think every time you see them, they look so guilty. They look like they're, they call [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=1002.48s)]
*  them a bat and you're a bandit. So they had that kind of a mask on them. I mean, they, when they [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=1007.52s)]
*  see our houses or your house, they just see a tree. They see, you know, every, you know, the [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=1011.52s)]
*  neighborhoods and subdivisions are tearing down more woods and more environment to build the houses. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=1017.76s)]
*  So they're running out of places and they don't have really their main predators, man. Wow. And [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=1023.4399999999999s)]
*  so they, they, when they look at your house, just like any of these animals, they just see a, they [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=1029.12s)]
*  just see a big tree, a funny looking tree. You know, they can climb right up this side and right up a [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=1033.2s)]
*  downspout and they'll find a way in and they'll make, they'll make your home, their home. So they [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=1038.0s)]
*  just see their house, your house is a tree, really? That's it. I mean, that's what they see it is, [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=1043.68s)]
*  you know, just, just a different type of structure. They want to be the, the female raccoons. They want [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=1047.12s)]
*  to be a pie. They want, you know, if you're not in like a cavity of a tree, it's where they know would [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=1052.7199999999998s)]
*  be in the nature because they want it. They want to be a pie. So when they had their young, they're [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=1057.52s)]
*  away from predators. They're away from things that could hurt their babies. One of their main, [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=1061.52s)]
*  one of their main concerns when they're having their babies is male raccoons. Another one of [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=1066.32s)]
*  mother nature's things is a male raccoon will search out the female and kill those babies [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=1071.04s)]
*  to make her come into heat again, which is another nature, another cruel way of mother nature. It's, [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=1077.76s)]
*  it's just a cycle. Just, it's just mother nature. And so the mama raccoons or sow [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=1083.3600000000001s)]
*  raccoons that we call them, they'll, they'll go, they get hide up in the attics and that's, [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=1089.6000000000001s)]
*  they'll make their dens trying to keep away from everything else and the male raccoons. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=1094.32s)]
*  So even there, could it even be the own male that knocked them up? [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=1098.4s)]
*  I mean, it could be. I don't know. Oh my God, dude. It sounds like a damn John Grisham. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=1102.3200000000002s)]
*  I mean, it is possible. Some of the one technique that we use, um, eviction fluid, which is mainly [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=1108.0s)]
*  raccoon piss. And you can take it. I'm not a big fan of it because I like to catch the raccoon and [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=1114.72s)]
*  remove it. No, I've removed it out of your house, but you can take eviction fluid and put around [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=1120.72s)]
*  their entry hole and in the attic and the female raccoon will think there's a male present and take [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=1124.96s)]
*  her babies and shy guy there. Okay. So you mean if you want to get her out of there, some, some places [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=1131.1200000000001s)]
*  they, if you use like all humane, no, no trapping, they can use eviction fluid and that that's something [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=1136.72s)]
*  that can make the female think there's a male present and she'll get her babies and get out. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=1143.3600000000001s)]
*  But you still have, there's a raccoon there, right? It's going to go somewhere else. It's going to be [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=1148.0s)]
*  somebody else's problem. I mean, I like to trap them and get rid of it. That way I can tell the [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=1152.0s)]
*  customer, Hey, we got, I've got mama. I got five kits out of your attic and sealed up and we're good [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=1156.88s)]
*  to go. And we got, yeah, we got the problem solved. Otherwise you just, once you put that piss down, [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=1162.96s)]
*  they're just looking, you're just, you're scaring them off. You don't know where you're scaring them [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=1167.76s)]
*  to. Yeah. I mean, you haven't really solved the problem. They can, they'll either leave or they'll [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=1171.52s)]
*  just go even deeper. You just carry in the one. Yeah. You haven't really solved the problem. Now, [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=1175.6s)]
*  what about this? Uh, I want to get back a little bit to this. I mean, it's almost like a Shakespeare [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=1179.6s)]
*  story that the, so the, the female can have children, have babies, raccoon can have babies [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=1186.3999999999999s)]
*  and a man raccoon will come and kill the babies while they're being born. Well, after she has, [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=1195.1999999999998s)]
*  after she has them, will the male raccoon eat them or just kill them? He usually just kills them. [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=1202.1599999999999s)]
*  Okay. Kill them and then kill them just so the female will go back in the heat. So then he can [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=1207.84s)]
*  get laid basically. Yeah. I mean, yeah, you can put it that, I mean, it's not the only, all animals [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=1212.72s)]
*  do it. Uh, lions, you know, the, they'll kill the cubs, you know, and other animals like it'll kill [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=1218.32s)]
*  their offspring or the offspring. It just hurts me, man. To make her, to make them come back in the [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=1223.6s)]
*  heat. So that's, it just hurts my feelings. I mean, that's not, I don't come across it very often, [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=1228.48s)]
*  but I mean, I've found it where I come to an attic inspection and just find a blood bath, [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=1234.08s)]

*  Same way as a little baby groundhogs, cute and cuddly looking, but they're going to grow up to [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=1948.88s)]

*  really causing a disruption in their world. We're the one invading their territory. [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=1983.68s)]
*  Yeah. Like you buy a piece of land. It's like, you know, it's not like you get to go to the [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=1989.28s)]

*  Right. And they're going to come up to your front porch, under your bushes, [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=2001.28s)]
*  up against your barn or garage. And they're going to dig their holes because you're in their [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=2005.3600000000001s)]
*  world. That's their area. And then that, and then they're cute and cuddly and not really a big harm [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=2010.88s)]
*  when they're out in nature, other than the cow or horse, you know, stepping in the hole, maybe [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=2016.88s)]
*  breaking their leg, something or, you know, something like that. But then when they invade [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=2020.8s)]
*  your house, then they're a pest and then they got to go. Most people don't ever encounter something [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=2024.88s)]
*  like that until they become a pest. Right. Right. Yeah. Cause you don't notice it really. Yeah. [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=2029.52s)]
*  They're neat. Oh, look at the groundhog in the neighbor's yard over there. And then next summer, [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=2033.84s)]
*  when that groundhog had babies and some of their babies come to your house or grown, start digging, [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=2037.76s)]
*  then it's not cute anymore. Then they, then they call us. It is interesting how animals go from [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=2042.6399999999999s)]

*  do little shit in the garage. And suddenly things have gotten out of control. Had a couple. It [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=2120.0s)]
*  mainly happens on like a rental property where somebody's had a pet pet raccoon. Okay. So it [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=2125.36s)]
*  starts with the right. So it's usually raccoons. Yeah, it's usually a raccoon. Sometimes squirrels, [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=2130.88s)]
*  they know somebody finds a young raccoon. Oh yeah. You know, kit something happens. They find a [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=2135.1200000000003s)]

*  which I mean is what do they do? I don't know about Tennessee's laws. I'm not licensed here, [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=2144.16s)]
*  but in, in Kentucky, it's, it's against the law to keep to have a pet, any animal, it's indigenous [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=2148.96s)]
*  to the state deer, raccoon, turk, no. Okay. So taking it back home and slow that down for me [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=2154.96s)]
*  and for our listeners. But so what does that mean? Any animal with indigenous? Well, I mean, [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=2160.08s)]
*  it's a common animal in the state, no raccoon possum, fox, squirrel. You cannot have those as [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=2164.56s)]
*  pets. Yeah. You're not allowed to, you're not allowed to keep the wildlife as a pet. Even [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=2170.88s)]
*  like rehabilitate. Even if you think you're doing it, you're not, you're not supposed to not saying [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=2174.7999999999997s)]
*  they're going to come get you. Right. But there's some laws. I mean, they do know I'm, I have some [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=2178.64s)]
*  conservation officer friends and they do receive calls and complaints about people, pet deer, pet [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=2183.92s)]
*  raccoons. And you, I mean, they're still a wild animal. The, the raccoons, they can be, I mean, [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=2189.04s)]
*  you can have a raccoon and if you, if you Google it, they'll, they'll turn, you know, a raccoon [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=2195.44s)]
*  might be fine for a couple of years. And then they've turned into attack children, toddlers, [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=2201.6s)]
*  babies in their sleep. I mean, they, they're still a wild animal. Just, you know. So what usually, [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=2206.32s)]
*  like how do people first, let me get into how, what people have a raccoon, what do they try to do to [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=2211.84s)]
*  have it really be part of their little life? Like I see sometimes they'll put a little diaper on it [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=2216.08s)]
*  or they'll put a damn little necklace on it or something. You see them maybe get a little bit of [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=2219.92s)]
*  you know, I've seen one had a little even somebody made it a little damn amulet thing for its wrist. [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=2225.68s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? Like you see people really try and make them human in some way. Have [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=2231.36s)]
*  you come into somebody, you ever, you know, if you had to go and you find something and it's wearing [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=2237.04s)]
*  a damn, you know, a eyes odd shirt or something, or, you know, have you ever found anything like [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=2240.24s)]
*  that where somebody's got a damn homemade outfit, you know, got some, you know, little baby, uh, [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=2244.96s)]
*  Birkenstocks on a damn, uh, on a raccoon or anything like that. No, I mean, I've run across [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=2250.0s)]
*  people, pet raccoons and then it's cool. I mean, they, that's their prerogative. They got them [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=2255.04s)]
*  dressed up or not? No, they don't. I mean, they'll have, I've seen them with collars on them, you know, [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=2259.6s)]
*  a little decorative collars, but not dressed. I mean, if you put something on a raccoon, [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=2263.2s)]
*  it's a go pull it off. I mean, they're, they're pretty, they're pretty, they're very smart animal. [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=2266.4s)]
*  They're going to pull it off. I mean, I've seen people pet squirrels and you get them as a baby. [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=2270.64s)]
*  I mean, they're, but they're still a wild animal. And do it. So is there a, is there something you [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=2275.12s)]
*  can do to keep it domesticated so it doesn't turn wild again? I mean, everything can turn. I mean, [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=2280.08s)]
*  I don't personally know. I've, I've raised a few deer up for a small, a little bit of time. Uh, [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=2286.96s)]
*  as I had one that we, that we, that got on a job and I kept it for a while. And then it turned. [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=2293.2s)]
*  Well, I took it to the rehabilitator and I get dough or a phone call baby deer get abandoned. [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=2298.32s)]
*  I mean, like on a deer, I'm forgetting off the subject here. The worst thing to like, [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=2304.56s)]
*  people say, I found a baby deer is mama. When she takes her, when she has her baby, [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=2309.2000000000003s)]
*  she'll place it away from her to keep. She keeps away from it as much as he can, [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=2313.52s)]
*  not to put any sin on it. That way a predator won't find it. So when she beds the baby deer down, [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=2318.0800000000004s)]
*  she'll put it down and she'll leave and go away from him. And she just couple hundred yards away. [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=2324.0s)]
*  But that way, if something comes, it don't get her baby and people, if all here's an abandoned [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=2328.8s)]
*  deer, I'm going to help it. I'm a say, once you touch it, it's done. She's not going to take that [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=2333.1200000000003s)]
*  baby back. It's got your human sin on it. And then they'll call it. They'll try to raise it themselves [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=2337.28s)]
*  or they'll call me or call a game warden. And then we take them, you know, I've kept them for [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=2342.1600000000003s)]
*  several weeks, you know, just getting them back on their feet, bottle feeding them and then take [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=2346.96s)]
*  them to a rehabber in which they are, they're a licensed rehabber and they raise them up. [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=2351.04s)]
*  They'll raise them up to where they can survive on their own and release them back in the wild. [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=2354.96s)]
*  And they do that with all, I mean, they do that with all animals. I mean, [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=2358.72s)]
*  baby raccoons, we can take him to a rehabber and they can rate the bottle feed him, [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=2362.3199999999997s)]
*  raise them up and release them back into the wild. [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=2366.96s)]
*  Okay. Okay. Let's get a question that came in from one of our listeners here. We've got a lot of [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=2368.8799999999997s)]

*  I got a question for you guys. What's harder to catch in the streets? One of these young cats [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=2387.6s)]
*  or one of them dog dogs out there. What's harder to catch out in the streets when you're working? [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=2395.92s)]
*  By the way, Theo, thank you for that gang merch just came in. Oh man. Official, that new edition [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=2400.88s)]
*  with the hit her in the front, baby. People make a lot of bootleg merchandise [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=2409.8399999999997s)]
*  and sell it and that's bootleg brother. Sorry. That's unbelievably bootleg. Dear God. [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=2416.24s)]
*  So that's a good question, man. That is a, that's a good question. A lot of [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=2423.9199999999996s)]
*  wildlife operators will not touch a cat. Okay. We don't normally ever fool with a canine because [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=2430.16s)]
*  you have dog pound dog warden, but there's no cat warden. Oh, okay. And I, I myself, I do cat work. [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=2435.8399999999997s)]

*  I'm sure if you drive around, I mean, most towns and cities driving, you'll see cats running [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=2460.56s)]
*  everywhere. Oh yeah. We said, they just, they just scavenge off whatever they can find. You [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=2464.8s)]
*  can't touch them. They're just wild. Oh dude. I grew up in the stray animal belt, man. We had [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=2470.0s)]
*  cats everywhere. We had animals passing through town. We had damn parakeet. I mean, everything [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=2473.44s)]

*  Well, that's, I mean, you get a, oh, for instance, like a townhome community and they'll go from one [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=2482.56s)]
*  or two cats and you know, little old ladies feeding them. She feels sorry for them to 60, 70 cats and [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=2489.6s)]
*  they attack her while she's asleep. Well, a couple of female cats, they get bred. They have kittens [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=2495.36s)]
*  within, you know, less than a year. Those kittens will breed. And then another year, those kittens [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=2500.08s)]
*  from those kittens will breed. So it's like that story can go really, then you've got all these [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=2504.56s)]
*  cats that are living, they're going to get disease because there's so many of them. They get all over [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=2509.36s)]
*  your cars. They crap all and pee all around your bushes and stinks. And then, but you can't get [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=2513.84s)]
*  close to them. So that's when they, they get up, you know, I'll do fair. I'm not going to turn down [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=2519.84s)]
*  work. I try to help my community. You know, sometimes it's hard, you know, trying to find [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=2525.36s)]
*  homes for them. Some, you know, I have to struggle sometimes to find shelters. It'll take the cat. [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=2529.6s)]
*  And when you pick them up, you put them in the back seat or front seat? Where do you put her? [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=2534.8s)]

*  this is a true story. So when I was growing up, I was real scared, right? We grew up in a pretty [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=2628.0s)]
*  scary area. And I remember hearing when I was young, and I've talked about this a bunch on this [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=2631.3599999999997s)]
*  podcast, but I remember hearing when I was young, if, if animals smell urine, they won't come by, [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=2636.0s)]
*  you know, that's what I remember hearing. So I was so scared that I would pee or I would stand on my [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=2641.44s)]
*  bed at night and pee around it in like a semi-circle so that no animals came to get me. Cause I was so [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=2645.6s)]
*  scared of like, huh? Yeah. I never got attacked by anything, you know, or anything, uh, indoors. [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=2650.8s)]

*  you know, just that you hear stuff like that and, and, and how to heart you can take it as a child. [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=2660.56s)]

*  jurisdiction issues. Do you ever run into jurisdiction issues where the dog catcher [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=2670.3999999999996s)]

*  a good point too. That's why you don't want to get near. I mean, a lot of my friends, they won't touch [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=2719.6s)]
*  a cat job just for that fact. I, I'm picky about my, I get a lot like factories, uh, power plants [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=2722.88s)]

*  it's a health risk. Usually you drop them at the power plant. They're going to go somehow. [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=2740.1600000000003s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? I feel like that's kind of that, you know, a lot of people used to do that. [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=2744.1600000000003s)]
*  They dropped them off at the power plant and let, you know, and let, you know, let it happen, [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=2747.92s)]
*  you know, let it kind of work out that cat scratch fever right there, but how about this? So what I'm [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=2754.0s)]
*  trying to figure out is, um, so when it comes to the domestic animals, that's not really your line [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=2758.64s)]
*  of work. No. How did you get from your, the, your grandfather gives you the trap and you're trapping [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=2765.2000000000003s)]
*  stuff around the way. How do you then get into the echelon where you stay in that vein for most of [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=2770.48s)]
*  your youth and childhood and, uh, and then you just get into it as a profession. When did that [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=2776.0s)]
*  start? Well, I grew up hunting, fishing, trapping. My grandfather taught me everything. And then I [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=2781.68s)]
*  get into the job world, work a couple of jobs. And then I worked for, uh, my last one was for a rock [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=2788.16s)]
*  mine close to where I live, underground mine. And I still trapped, you know, on this, you know, [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=2793.92s)]

*  of them, it taught me a lot of stuff. My mentor, Ronnie Vincent, which is about 150 miles away from [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=2831.52s)]
*  me. And he kind of took me under, told me how to get me started. What, no, just kind of get tips [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=2838.16s)]
*  where new guys get into the business and just evolved from there. Went from trapping, loving [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=2844.64s)]
*  the trap. You got to be a trapper to do this. You just hate, I mean, you can't just go by trap. [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=2849.36s)]
*  You could go by traps and do it, but you got to know how to lure the animal in what baits work [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=2854.32s)]
*  best, what areas they're going to use to come, you know, runways or travel away. You got to have a [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=2860.4s)]
*  little bit of background in it where it really helps to do that. So it just evolved from trapping [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=2865.6s)]
*  as a kid, loving animals to wanting to change your career. So I quit my other job as a miner [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=2871.84s)]
*  and was already farming. So farming full time. And then I started my wildlife business. [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=2879.28s)]
*  And so, um, so Ronnie was, you kind of worked as an apprentice in some way under, you know, Ronnie, [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=2884.4s)]

*  it on a house, you know, and I got to, you know, I had to take, I had to study and take my tests [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=2902.64s)]
*  through the state, fish and wildlife to be a nuisance control operator and had to study guide. [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=2907.04s)]
*  And I bought a new co-op, which is just a, um, an organization for the wildlife operators [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=2912.08s)]
*  and some of their core online courses and some of their books and literature to just get more from [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=2918.64s)]
*  animal trapping in the wild to adapt into your house. Okay. Right on. The difference [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=2924.64s)]
*  of trapping a raccoon in somebody's barn to, to making a positive set on a house and it's in your [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=2929.6s)]
*  soffit and you're 25, 30 feet off the ground with a trap upside down under the soffit. We'll try to [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=2935.36s)]
*  screw it down, attach it to your side of your house. Do you ever have to like finger print or [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=2943.04s)]
*  dust for prance or do any kind of like track? Like, is there any detective type style work, [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=2947.44s)]
*  you know? Yeah. Um, one thing that we use a lot now is cameras. Um, I use a spy point cell cameras [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=2952.8s)]
*  to go send the pictures to your cell phone. There's other ones, uh, are low cameras that do video [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=2960.8s)]
*  and we use that. I've got three going on jobs now. I mean, we all use that to monitor, um, say I, [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=2966.4s)]
*  are they coming and going here? So I'll put that camera up and now it'll send an alert to my phone. [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=2972.8s)]
*  I know when that raccoon is coming and going and their motion sensitive. Well, yeah, it's motion, [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=2978.0800000000004s)]
*  motion sensitive. Uh, another trick that we use that I've used, um, if I suspect something's [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=2982.5600000000004s)]
*  coming and going, don't really know what it is. I'll take flour, put some flour down on a piece [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=2989.36s)]
*  of cardboard and when they step through that, they'll lead their tracks. We do that. We, yeah, [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=2994.1600000000003s)]
*  we, we do that for Santa, you know? Yeah. I had to see a static come through. Yeah. And one time [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=2998.32s)]

*  urinating on stuff, he urinated on something. Um, what type of animal has the most sex out there? [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=3006.6400000000003s)]
*  I wonder when people think, cause a lot of animals, you see a lot of animals and you'll see them with [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=3012.88s)]
*  their children, but you don't hear about the sex a lot of times. Um, is there a lot of animals [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=3017.12s)]
*  where animal, the actual mating becomes a problem for a homeowner where that is the issue a lot of [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=3022.4s)]
*  times? I mean, I, I don't think that's really an issue. I mean, I've never, I've never had somebody [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=3028.64s)]

*  something they're probably not going to do in your front yard for you. But I know what I like. Yeah. [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=3049.52s)]
*  But I mean, I guess when they get into the house to mate, I guess we'd do, [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=3056.4s)]
*  well, they'll be mating a raccoon or mate. They'll mate. They won't go in the house to mate. [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=3059.6s)]

*  down. I reached down and grabbed the trap. I picked it up from the top. I had it sitting [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=3198.7200000000003s)]
*  horizontal, up and straight up and down. And I grabbed the end of it and stuck my finger [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=3203.92s)]
*  into the cage where, where she could find it. And she grabbed a hold of me and knew this to say, [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=3208.56s)]
*  I let out pretty good scream and a few words I shouldn't have in front of the [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=3214.6400000000003s)]

*  and I'll put my hands through the end of it where the door is. There's nothing there. So I'll just [[00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=3243.76s)]
*  put my hand fingers through the cage and pick it up. Right. Well, I was talking to her and [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=3248.4s)]
*  looked away as I was reaching it, reaching for the cage and just wouldn't look in just stupid [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=3253.2000000000003s)]

*  When I was growing up, rabies was a big deal. It was just popular. You would constantly hear [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=3504.7200000000003s)]
*  about it, the fear of it, what was going on. Then I get a text from somebody maybe a year ago and [[00:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=3511.76s)]
*  they said rabies is kind of making a comeback. Have you heard of this? Yeah, rabies in Kentucky [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=3518.5600000000004s)]
*  in my area of the state, it's gotten worse over the last couple of years. Oh, Christ. [[00:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=3525.36s)]
*  As in not, I don't know of people cases, but animals getting tested and getting the rabies at [[00:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=3530.7200000000003s)]
*  Fox, Raccoon, Skunk and Coyotes are all in the rabies vector and we have to euthanize those now [[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=3538.08s)]
*  because there's such a high number of rabies cases with them. Now you roll up on one of these, right? [[00:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=3544.6400000000003s)]
*  You know, something that's rabid. How do you know out of the gate? [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=3550.7999999999997s)]
*  I got a call last week from a car dealership at home. Hey, we got this raccoon or excuse me, [[00:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=3555.84s)]
*  excuse me, it's Skunk. They're getting animals micked up. It was a Skunk. They said, oh look, [[00:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=3561.92s)]
*  if a Skunk gets its nails done, it's almost a damn raccoon. I'll tell you that. Well, [[00:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=3565.92s)]
*  it's in the middle of the parking lot at 12 o'clock in the afternoon at lunchtime. Yeah. [[00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=3568.7999999999997s)]
*  And it's walking around in circles. It's falling down. It's stumbling. It's stomping, [[00:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=3573.92s)]
*  which is what's the, something they do when they're threatened. They'll stop there. [[00:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=3580.08s)]
*  They'll rear up and take their feet and stop the ground. It's basically like seeing like somebody [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=3583.1200000000003s)]
*  that's cracked out on drugs and it's spraying. It is spraying some, it is spraying some scent. [[00:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=3586.96s)]
*  Oh, spray it. Spray it. It's a essence, which I call it. It's Skunk spray and it's doing that. [[00:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=3591.36s)]
*  And I thought, well, it's, it's, it's, it's showing signs. It's either got this temper [[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=3596.7200000000003s)]
*  or rabid. Damn. And so I come out and I ended up, I just, I put my gloves on, I brought a cage, [[01:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=3601.2s)]
*  put a cage down over next to it and I took some six foot tongs, which is like just big grabbers [[01:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=3609.68s)]
*  and just kind of forced it into the, pushed it into the trap, shut the lid and done deal. But that, [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=3614.96s)]
*  I mean, you don't know if it's right. It's, it's showing signs of either being this temper or [[01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=3620.24s)]
*  Now a rabid animal has to be euthanized or taken, taken control. Like there's, you can't, [[01:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=3627.12s)]
*  because there's no cure for rabies. I have to, in my part of the state, I have to euthanize the [[01:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=3633.68s)]
*  skunks because there's so many of them have been found with rabies that if I capture one, you know, [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=3639.2s)]
*  one in the wild is one thing, but if I, once I capture one, we have it, they want me to euthanize [[01:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=3644.88s)]
*  it. Right. Because then it could really infect a person at that point. Yeah. I mean, it's, [[01:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=3650.56s)]
*  it's not afraid of people. It's coming around your house. You don't want to let that one go. [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=3654.16s)]
*  So you don't want to relocate it because it could have rabies. It could have another disease. And [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=3658.4s)]
*  then you would transmit that to the rest of the population in that area. Yeah. So I mean, it's, [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=3662.96s)]
*  Oh yeah. If it's out there stomping his feet in a parking lot at noon, I mean, it'll be washing [[01:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=3667.92s)]
*  your windows at fucking 4pm on Main Street. Not a normal animal. You see a raccoon at the daytime. [[01:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=3671.44s)]
*  That's a big sign. Now. So once you get that animal, now to euthanize you guys have, you take it to a [[01:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=3678.3199999999997s)]
*  certain place. Is it like, kind of like a bag and gas kind of vibe? Or is it, I mean, we have the [[01:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=3685.2s)]
*  state lets us do different types of euthanasia, gas chambers and most popular, which is the CO and [[01:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=3689.92s)]
*  no, it just pain, you know, puts them to sleep. Oh yeah. We used to have a carbon monoxide leak [[01:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=3697.68s)]
*  over at my buddy Jeff's house, dude. And so his, nobody knew, right? This was in 94 or five, baby, [[01:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=3702.64s)]
*  you know? And, uh, and we just started smoking weed. We didn't even know about doing huffing gas, [[01:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=3710.56s)]
*  you know? And next thing you know, man, we go over there, we fall asleep on Friday, wake up on Sunday, [[01:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=3716.7999999999997s)]
*  baby boy. I mean, dude, I woke up, I felt damn nine months old, dude. I felt so good, man, [[01:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=3720.8799999999997s)]
*  because he had a gas leak in there, you know? So every now and then a little bit isn't, [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=3728.72s)]
*  it's not horrible, but it's a lot of kill you. Yeah. A lot of kill you. Now if you have, so that's, [[01:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=3732.7999999999997s)]
*  so that's a raccoon being rabid. Well, how do you know some of these other animals are rabid? Well, [[01:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=3738.56s)]
*  I mean, a raccoon will act the same way. Um, what, what they'll act? No, you said, we already said [[01:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=3742.7999999999997s)]
*  raccoon. What are you talking about? Oh, that was a skunk. Yeah. The skunk is the one I captured the [[01:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=3747.68s)]
*  parking lot. Oh, that was that, that, uh, that it's showing signs of being sick, either distemper [[01:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=3752.16s)]
*  or rabies. You know, you, I treat, I kind of treat them all like they got something just like, [[01:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=3757.6s)]
*  in, uh, in the fire, in my EMS fire department setting, like on a wreck, I treat, you treat [[01:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=3763.8399999999997s)]
*  everybody like they got something that way you're always covered. You always wear PPE, you always [[01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=3770.0s)]
*  wear your gloves. You don't say, well, he don't have it. Don't need them. You treat everything [[01:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=3774.08s)]
*  like it's got it. So whenever I hang to the animals, I always got my gloves on. You treat all of them [[01:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=3778.48s)]
*  like they would have rabies just so you don't, so you don't take the chance. Um, now when you, uh, [[01:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=3783.84s)]
*  when you're going on these house calls and stuff, well, how about this? What's the, uh, love life [[01:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=3793.84s)]
*  like? Is it hard to meet a woman when you're in the animal world? Do you ever meet a woman on a call [[01:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=3799.6800000000003s)]
*  that you ended up taking on a date sometime? I could imagine. So I can take to me on dates. [[01:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=3803.52s)]

*  She just laughed at me. Here we are. Been married 23 years and we were together for about two years [[01:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=3839.92s)]

*  She, I'll tell you a quick little story. She, I had a bunch of, when we were allowed to relocate [[01:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=3857.28s)]
*  still, I, we got a 500 acre farm. Okay. And I would let- Now when you say you're allowed to relocate, [[01:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=3862.16s)]
*  just to clarify, so I know what we're saying. Was that mean you're allowed to take animals? [[01:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=3868.24s)]
*  Yeah. Like if I had some raccoons, I could relocate them on an approved area. They had to be a hundred [[01:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=3871.9199999999996s)]
*  plus acres and had to be landowner permission and I could release them. And so that was something [[01:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=3876.3999999999996s)]
*  that was allowed by the state by your area for your job in your area. It's no longer allowed. [[01:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=3881.3599999999997s)]
*  No, not on those certain animals or rabies vector animals. Okay. So I mean, if I get your groundhog, [[01:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=3885.6s)]
*  I can release it. Right. Get your squirrel. I can release it. But some animals you cannot. [[01:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=3890.56s)]
*  I can't release them. Not anymore. So anyway, so I had about six or seven raccoons and I was [[01:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=3894.88s)]
*  letting, I had my wife with me. I said, well, you video this and make a good video. So I said, [[01:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=3901.44s)]
*  you video it and I'm going to let them go. And so she's all here. He is sitting here and I get the [[01:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=3905.52s)]
*  trap out and I set it down and it runs off and she's video and all it runs off in the wood. [[01:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=3909.84s)]
*  And I do two or three like that. And then I get one up and I said, this was for you, baby. I turn [[01:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=3914.7200000000003s)]
*  around, let it go. And it went right after went right next to her feet, scared her to death, [[01:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=3918.96s)]
*  screamed. That was the last time she went with me when we let animals go. She's a little bit upset [[01:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=3924.0s)]
*  over that. She just scared. Now my daughter be right there. I'll bring in kit raccoons and my [[01:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=3929.68s)]
*  daughter, you know, she'll play with them and hold them and she's all into animals. But if I liked [[01:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=3934.08s)]
*  letting them go, I mean, that was the better alternative. Yeah. I had to do what they, I had [[01:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=3940.8s)]
*  to do what the state requires me to do. Right. So some of it's not always good, but. What's an [[01:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=3945.44s)]

*  time they chew a new hole, we we nail a soup can lid over top of it. So I knew this was going to [[01:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=4268.4800000000005s)]
*  be a bad job. I mean, it was such a bad infestation that I catch a rat and it would get eaten before I [[01:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=4274.72s)]
*  got there. Like she get up in the morning and check all the traps and say, okay, we got some rats. [[01:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=4282.8s)]

*  ground right now? It's caught in a foot trap. Okay. And I like the red fox. I don't like the, [[01:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=5041.12s)]
*  so this is a red fox. This isn't a bobcat. Yeah, that's, that's a red fox. I like the red fox. They, [[01:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=5047.6s)]
*  they are on the euthanasia list in the nuisance part. Now this is, this is for trapping just [[01:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=5052.16s)]
*  regular. I'm trapping under my trappers license and I'll release all them when possible because [[01:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=5058.24s)]
*  they're just don't see as many of them. And I just use a choke pole. And so I let him loose and bam, [[01:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=5063.599999999999s)]
*  he's, he's off to live another day. There was a girl, I ran into a girl a couple of months ago [[01:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=5070.48s)]
*  in Los Angeles and she had a fox fur coat and she was kind of wearing it late at, she didn't want to [[01:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=5075.68s)]
*  tell everybody. She told everybody it was fake, but then I felt like it wasn't fake. You know, [[01:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=5080.48s)]
*  I touched it and I felt like I said, I don't know. I felt some fake stuff before and it felt like [[01:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=5084.4s)]
*  real stuff. Oh, they're very nice. So she admitted to me secretly she'd been doing drugs, but she told [[01:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=5089.2s)]
*  me secretly that it was real. So there's, I mean, there's a lot of the fur industry is really gone. [[01:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=5094.24s)]
*  You'll see more actors, actors, singers, sporting fur, sporting bobcat. That's the biggest thing. [[01:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=5100.16s)]
*  I have several bobcats that I've been, that I've held onto that I want to have made into a vest or [[01:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=5107.2s)]
*  coat. And I have some black bar or black coats that I've held that I've trapped over the years. [[01:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=5112.88s)]
*  Wow. Now when I have a kind of like a black coat backing and bobcat front, I'd buy something like [[01:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=5118.0s)]
*  that from you. I mean, it's, I mean, there, you can, I mean, the fur coat, the, like the bobcats, [[01:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=5124.64s)]
*  I see all the fur goes to, for the fur industry. Most of it ships to like China and Russia for, [[01:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=5129.2s)]
*  liners for fur coats or jackets. But like the bobcat, there's a guy that would used to buy mine [[01:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=5136.08s)]
*  and Alexa in Kentucky that makes custom furs coats and stuff. And he buys the bobcats for that. [[01:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=5141.360000000001s)]
*  Yes. I don't know if it's secretly still a pretty big business or not. You know, I mean, it's, [[01:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=5148.16s)]
*  I mean, a lot of people are down on it. I mean, but a lot of people like it too. And a lot of [[01:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=5154.400000000001s)]
*  people are down on what we do. You know, people don't like the trapping. Yeah. I mean, it, [[01:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=5158.4800000000005s)]
*  it injures them sometime. You know, it, it catches them by the foot. No, it does hurt. [[01:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=5163.04s)]
*  No, it does do more. The more they fight, the more they might hurt themselves. But I've actually [[01:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=5168.0s)]
*  got in places to trap before farms, a trap in the winter by taking a trap and sticking my hand in it [[01:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=5173.6s)]
*  and just usually like a number two, one's not real hard, powerful. It don't break the bones, [[01:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=5179.76s)]
*  break the, it don't feel good, but that lets somebody know, okay, well, if a dog does get [[01:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=5184.8s)]
*  caught in, it's not going to break its foot off. Right. And if I'm willing to stick my hand in it, [[01:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=5189.04s)]
*  they're willing to let me track because they don't fear what the cat gets. It is not going to kill [[01:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=5193.76s)]
*  the cat. Right. It just won't like it very well, but it'd be able to be released unharmed. I mean, [[01:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=5197.36s)]
*  it's kind of strange. You know, I do that, but some people do that. You do trapping is getting [[01:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=5201.44s)]
*  harder and harder to find places to trap. Well, it's weird that we're part of nature, [[01:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=5206.48s)]
*  but we sometimes act like we're this, but we're this more conscious part of nature, [[01:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=5211.68s)]
*  I guess, because it's not like you probably have some raccoons that won't come in and kill the babies [[01:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=5218.8s)]
*  to get the mother to go back in it. You know what I'm saying? It's not like you don't have these [[01:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=5226.24s)]
*  other dirty parts of nature that run its course. You know, I have a friend who does some big game [[01:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=5228.88s)]
*  hunting and he talks about how a lot of times the conservation, the place you go to hunt, [[01:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=5235.44s)]
*  whatever it is, you have to pay like half a million dollars to do it. And the money you pay, [[01:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=5241.44s)]
*  it's usually a sick animal that you're killing or an old animal that's not procreating. [[01:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=5248.48s)]
*  Yes. And so the money you're going to pay is going to take care of 500 other animals. You know, [[01:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=5254.4s)]
*  like it's just interesting sometimes like how one news article, you know, sometimes just won't give [[01:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=5261.28s)]
*  you all the facts. So at least you can make, have a little bit more information. They'll feed, [[01:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=5268.8s)]
*  like they'll take that animal too and they'll feed the whole village. Right. Oh, totally. Yeah. Yeah. [[01:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=5274.32s)]
*  They won't even, they might take a, they might get some part of the animal taxidermied or get a photo [[01:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=5278.4s)]
*  or something like that for their relic, but they're going to, yeah, but that, that the food from that [[01:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=5283.2s)]
*  could feed the entire village and also, but the money for the conservation group is going to, [[01:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=5289.2s)]
*  it's going to bring to, it's going to help so many more animals live. It's almost unbelievable. You [[01:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=5294.96s)]
*  know, I mean the hunters have been that money goes for the preservation, the, to keep the poachers [[01:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=5300.16s)]
*  away. Totally. You know, the fancy or whatever. I mean, you need it. Look, I'll tell you this. I was [[01:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=5305.44s)]
*  in South Africa. This is probably maybe eight years ago, seven years ago doing comedy shows over there [[01:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=5310.16s)]
*  and we met a man one day and he was rich. This man was rich man. He, his wife had run a diamond [[01:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=5315.28s)]
*  mine or mine and they, or hell, maybe it was a diamond mine. Maybe it was damn Indiana Jones, [[01:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=5323.44s)]
*  but they had run something where they had made a ton of money, but they owned a nature preserve [[01:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=5333.36s)]
*  their own. I mean, and this dude took us in the helicopter over there and I actually ended up [[01:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=5338.96s)]
*  hooking up with his girlfriend. One time I still feel pretty bad about that, but, but anyway, [[01:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=5342.4s)]
*  this man took us over to their nature preserve and, and he took us around to, I mean, the biggest [[01:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=5347.28s)]
*  animals that he might've had, damn dinosaur. I don't remember what he had, but I mean, he had [[01:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=5352.96s)]
*  rhinoceros, everything, you know, just we pulled right up next to him and they were his in his [[01:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=5358.24s)]
*  damn yard. I mean, his yard, I'll admit was probably 50,000 acres or something, but it was [[01:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=5363.92s)]
*  a yard fast forward two weeks. He sends me a picture. The two rhinoceros we'd seen [[01:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=5368.48s)]
*  somebody broken in and sawed their horns off with a, a chainsaw and just left the bodies right there [[01:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=5375.44s)]
*  to rot. And he said poachers had gotten in and gotten them and it was trying to protect them and [[01:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=5380.639999999999s)]
*  get the people there poaching just to sell that little bit of ivory off of them. Right. So it's [[01:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=5385.679999999999s)]
*  just interesting. It's like one thing's going to happen. It's just nature. It's like this part of [[01:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=5390.719999999999s)]
*  nature is going to happen. Sometimes you have to do another part of it. You have to just, [[01:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=5395.6s)]
*  it's about managing nature. Yeah. So that's what my, I mean, it's gotta get in the way from the [[01:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=5400.8s)]
*  noose, the wildlife part, like my trap and my daughter doesn't, she doesn't like me getting [[01:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=5405.76s)]
*  all the animals that, you know, but she, she loves animals, right. But I, we keep them in check. [[01:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=5410.160000000001s)]
*  You know, this year, um, I trapped 66 cots and over the course of the four month trapping season, [[01:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=5415.68s)]
*  you know, think how many coyotes I took out of the population, all those females, which over half of [[01:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=5422.8s)]
*  them were females and they're going to have all those young, you know, all the baby deer that I [[01:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=5428.8s)]
*  saved, all the young turkeys that I saved, all the, I do a lot of work for a sheep farms and all the [[01:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=5433.68s)]
*  baby sheep. Oh, sheep will get attacked and sheep is just a damn fucking throw pillow full of dinner. [[01:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=5439.68s)]
*  They'll get them bitches immediately. So I just, we gotta keep it in check. You know, everything's [[01:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=5444.72s)]
*  got to be kept in check or if not, it'll, um, like the deer. I mean, that's why they have deer seasons [[01:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=5449.6s)]
*  and they keep up in the quota. If they didn't have a deer, if you weren't allowed to kill a deer, [[01:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=5455.92s)]
*  I mean, your insurance, that's what makes your insurance cost so much. Now is all the wrecks. [[01:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=5460.0s)]
*  I mean, where I live at deer, deer collisions are horrible. I mean, I've got friends have hit [[01:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=5464.240000000001s)]
*  10 different deer in their life, told them cars. I mean, it's there and if we didn't have these [[01:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=5469.4400000000005s)]
*  seasons to keep them in check, there'd be just that much more of them on the roads, crossing the [[01:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=5473.92s)]
*  roads. It was like all the other animals if there wasn't, but it's all in a, um, a balance, [[01:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=5478.08s)]
*  right? The groundhogs are starting to come make a comeback. And why are they doing it? What's going [[01:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=5484.32s)]
*  on? Their main predator was the coyote. Oh, so if you take too many and messes up the cycle, [[01:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=5488.72s)]
*  you take too many coyotes out and then the groundhogs are going to get overpopulated. [[01:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=5496.24s)]
*  Damn. So I mean, everything's got a spot. Everything's got a little spot net food chain, [[01:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=5501.36s)]
*  but I mean, they have to be kept in check. I mean, people know it's, it's part of it. [[01:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=5506.8s)]
*  Mother nature does it herself with disease and stuff. And now we're just giving her a little [[01:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=5510.96s)]
*  helping hand. No, look, I think it makes perfect sense. Like you're saying, if you don't take those [[01:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=5515.2s)]
*  coyotes out, then how many more turkeys do they get into? How many more baby deer do they kill? [[01:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=5519.76s)]
*  How many more, uh, chicken houses? Just different things. How many more different circles will they [[01:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=5526.24s)]
*  mess up? I mean, bobcats, they'll, they'll a bobcat take down a full grown deer. Damn. I mean, [[01:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=5532.8s)]
*  they, a bobcat goes for the neck. Well attack. No, a cat goes for the neck. Canine usually go for [[01:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=5537.84s)]
*  the rear. They bite. No, they, they tack from the rear, but you know, a bobcat, they'll take down [[01:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=5544.16s)]
*  and pets, both of them will take down. Coyotes are big pet killers because cats, if you, we got [[01:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=5549.52s)]
*  cats that around dogs, I have a little healer to cats, not scared of the dog. So a coyote could [[01:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=5555.68s)]
*  walk right up to a cat and just chomp, just take it with it. Cause the cat that's scared of it. [[01:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=5560.4s)]
*  Oh, cause they're the same species. Well, I mean, where they're, they're used to, my cats used to, [[01:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=5565.36s)]
*  no, most cats are used to cats that are outside are used to, I'm talking, I'm not talking about [[01:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=5569.92s)]
*  bobcats. Now I'm like a domesticated house cat or used to dogs. And so if a coyote walks through [[01:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=5573.759999999999s)]
*  your yard and the cats there, the cats like, Hey, what's up? Oh, you see, it's a dog. Yeah. [[01:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=5580.5599999999995s)]
*  And thanks to just a dog and bam, no coyotes are starting to come into our neighborhoods and eating [[01:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=5584.32s)]
*  the pets because they're easy meals. And they'll eat, they'll eat small dogs. They'll eat that. [[01:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=5588.48s)]
*  Bobcats don't know what they're real. They'll eat another cat. If it's out and you know, [[01:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=5592.799999999999s)]
*  if they can get to it, they're, they'll eat, they're a hunter. They'll eat whatever they can [[01:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=5597.679999999999s)]
*  come across. My God. But they, they kill. I mean, I've seen videos on cameras where coyotes were [[01:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=5600.959999999999s)]
*  attacking deer, bobcats were attacking deer. Do you feel sometimes like we're kind of ruining [[01:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=5610.0s)]
*  the world and that we, it's like kind of a bummer that we're in it, not in a bad way, like, [[01:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=5614.96s)]
*  but just, do you ever like have that moment where you're like, man, nature would be so much better [[01:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=5619.2s)]
*  in our world. We're, we're asking them to live in their area. That's your, after, I mean, no, [[01:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=5623.12s)]

*  Yeah. He don't. It's not on anymore. [[01:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=6744.4s)]
*  He would go into ponds and actually grab them. [[01:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=6747.04s)]
*  Yeah, there you go. He is actually a good friend of my good friend, Ronnie Vented. [[01:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=6750.64s)]
*  He helped me get started in the wildlife business. [[01:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=6756.08s)]

*  Damn. [[01:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=6760.8s)]

*  get rid of him for him. [[01:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=6769.04s)]
*  But it's interesting that the whole field, it seems like, you know, your grandfather [[01:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=6770.72s)]
*  kind of got you into dealing with animals. And it's just interesting that like [[01:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=6774.56s)]
*  in the same way that there's kind of the food chain and mother nature that [[01:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=6781.36s)]
*  the way that we learn things from each other and a lot of it is by [[01:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=6784.8s)]
*  another human showing us something, you know, it's like anybody could give you a book or [[01:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=6788.24s)]
*  send you a link to a video. But unless you really have somebody kind of showing you [[01:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=6792.64s)]
*  a lot of times, it's really how you get into things. [[01:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=6797.2s)]
*  It's like the trapping part of the dine thing. [[01:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=6799.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=6801.84s)]
*  I've had a buddy, he didn't know him at the time. Several years ago, he messages me, [[01:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=6802.24s)]
*  hey, man, I like I watch your I post all my catch pictures in the wintertime on my Facebook page. [[01:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=6809.44s)]

*  All right, we'll put a link. [[01:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=6825.12s)]
*  Then I have my business page. [[01:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=6825.84s)]
*  Hawk Wildlife Controls on Facebook also. [[01:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=6828.72s)]
*  So he messaged me is wanting to say, I like your stuff. Can I get in? Will you help me? [[01:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=6833.360000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=6838.08s)]
*  And so for about the next two years, he went try and we became real good friends. [[01:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=6838.56s)]
*  We trapped I showed him he didn't know a thing. I mean, his name was Josh Byron. [[01:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=6842.4800000000005s)]
*  Maybe you get to see this. And we became good friends and I taught him all about trapping [[01:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=6847.04s)]
*  everything that I've learned over the years and went out and trapped together for a couple [[01:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=6852.16s)]
*  years and then he went on his own night traps. And hopefully he'll pay. He's got two daughters. [[01:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=6856.0s)]
*  And hopefully maybe he'll pass that down to one of them or get to pass it on to I've helped several [[01:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=6861.04s)]
*  kids know he's not a kid, but I've helped several people like that pass that tradition on. [[01:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=6865.36s)]
*  Right. [[01:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=6870.0s)]
*  Which is a dying tradition. [[01:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=6870.24s)]
*  Is it? [[01:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=6871.76s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, you just don't see it in him. I mean, who do you know it goes out and traps [[01:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=6872.16s)]
*  coyotes in the winter. It's just a dying tradition. Nobody. I mean, it's kind of a, you know, one year [[01:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=6876.24s)]
*  my wife let me grow a beard. I mean, I had a mountain man, a pretty big, big, full beard, [[01:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=6881.68s)]
*  fun, Kate, do it no more. She won't let me. [[01:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=6887.84s)]
*  She won't. [[01:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=6889.52s)]
*  Nope. [[01:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=6890.0s)]
*  Why? What happens? [[01:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=6890.4800000000005s)]
*  She just don't like the beard. [[01:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=6891.360000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=6892.320000000001s)]
*  Oh, I can have a beard if it's neat and trimmed. [[01:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=6893.200000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=6895.4400000000005s)]
*  She's going to kill me for talking about her, but I can, if it's all neat and trimmed, I can have it. [[01:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=6895.68s)]
*  But rules is rules. We need rules, man. We need rules. [[01:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=6899.92s)]
*  Happy wife, happy life. [[01:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=6903.12s)]
*  There you go. That's what they say. I believe that man. [[01:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=6904.4800000000005s)]
*  Now, but tell me this. So a trapper, what does a trapper do? I just want to finish her. So I know [[01:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=6907.280000000001s)]
*  exactly clearly what a trapper is and what it does. [[01:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=6911.28s)]
*  I mean trapper versus wildlife, nuisance wildlife. [[01:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=6914.08s)]
*  Right. So when you say like you go trapping coyotes, like what do you like? [[01:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=6917.679999999999s)]
*  So when, when I'm trapping, I'm fur trapping there. Let me put it for nuisance wildlife, [[01:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=6920.88s)]
*  getting rid of animals that say I can't, I don't keep those first. If I catch a raccoon, [[01:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=6926.4s)]
*  it's out of season. I don't keep those animals. [[01:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=6930.08s)]
*  Right. [[01:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=6932.88s)]
*  And fur trapping is in the winter months from November to end of February is fur bearer season [[01:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=6933.5199999999995s)]
*  when I can go out and trap, you can go out and trap ground or go out and trap coyotes, raccoons, [[01:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=6940.32s)]
*  fox, beavers, bobcats. [[01:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=6947.12s)]
*  So it's just the same as hunting season, but it's fur- [[01:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=6950.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's fur bearer season, fur trapping season. [[01:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=6951.84s)]
*  Okay, cool. [[01:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=6954.32s)]
*  It's a lot of young kids, you know, a lot of people do it, old timers and pass it on and just [[01:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=6954.96s)]
*  people learn. I mean, there's a million YouTube videos about it. I mean, I'm still learning [[01:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=6959.599999999999s)]
*  stuff every day. I watch new techniques and new methods. You know, everybody's got their own [[01:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=6964.8s)]
*  method on how they trap or baits they use or bait and lure business is a huge business. [[01:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=6971.2s)]
*  Is it? [[01:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=6976.400000000001s)]
*  Trapping. Oh yeah. I mean, they all make the similar baits, but everybody's got their best bait. [[01:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=6976.64s)]
*  What's that top bait? You use a lure? What do you use? Chicken liver? [[01:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=6981.84s)]
*  No, it's like on my predator trapping. One of my favorite lures is Jeff Dunlop lures. [[01:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=6985.28s)]
*  He's just a big hardcore trapper and has developed his own lures, baits and lures. [[01:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=6991.36s)]
*  And now what kind of meat, if you use a meat or something, you use a- [[01:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=6996.16s)]
*  Well, most lures are made with, baits are made with like muskrat meat, tainted muskrat meat. [[01:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=7001.36s)]
*  It's aged, then it's got preservative in it. Or a beaver meat that's tainted a little bit to give [[01:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=7008.0s)]
*  off that, to give off the smell for that predator. [[01:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=7014.88s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[01:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=7018.08s)]
*  So they're like, like bobcat, you know, they, the muskrat meat based bait. [[01:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=7018.56s)]
*  They like that scrat. [[01:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=7024.8s)]
*  Pardon? [[01:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=7026.72s)]

*  Yeah. I mean, it's one of the things they eat. [[01:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=7028.320000000001s)]
*  Right. [[01:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=7030.72s)]
*  You know, I mean, they're beavers, bobcats love beavers. [[01:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=7031.04s)]
*  So let me name something and you tell me what eats it. All right. Groundhog. [[01:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=7035.28s)]
*  Coyote. [[01:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDy0UzL1sNg&t=7041.92s)]
