*  I'll sit and tell you [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=60.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah, Burke Chrysler, oh man, I love that guy. Yeah, he's so funny did he is an animal [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=79.72s)]
*  Or the machine they call him. He's everything. Yeah, he's [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=85.88s)]
*  He's like and he laughs all the time every time he's he reminds you of like Winnie the Pooh like if Winnie the Pooh went to [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=90.04s)]
*  College and was like in a fraternity for a really long time. Oh, yeah, you know like just like [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=96.14s)]
*  Yeah, he's one of a kind man [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=103.8s)]
*  So you live over in Tucson? Yeah, nice man. I went to Santa Rita High School for a really for a semester [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=106.6s)]
*  Yeah, my mom used to live out on Pantano. Oh my gosh [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=112.28s)]
*  So I used to be out there and people would fight in the car washes and stuff like that after school [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=115.72s)]
*  So we didn't have any border control. We could use some border control [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=120.72s)]
*  We could have used some border control out of Santa Rita High School man go Eagles [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=124.96000000000001s)]
*  So Roy via real, let's say you say your last name nailed it. Yeah, so your position with the border. What was it exactly? [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=131.44s)]
*  So I recently retired from the Border Patrol served for 32 years [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=138.72s)]
*  My position at the time was the chief patrol agent of the Tucson sector. Okay, and that sector is about how big? [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=141.92s)]
*  260 miles of border with [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=149.07999999999998s)]
*  Arizona border with Mexico [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=151.24s)]
*  Okay, and so when you're in charge of that, are you in charge of both sides of it? [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=152.96s)]
*  Or just one side just the one side so we have control over the US side [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=156.72s)]
*  Do they have do you know the person who's in charge of the other side? [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=161.6s)]
*  Like is there someone in charge of the other side? Well, yes to a degree dealing with the Mexican government [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=164.54s)]
*  You're dealing with different entities [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=169.44s)]
*  Their customs their immigration [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=171.44s)]
*  Federal police local police. There's a whole myriad of entities you have to deal with in Mexico. Okay [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=173.72s)]
*  So like on a day-to-day basis kind of what were some of like your kind of responsibilities? [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=179.96s)]
*  Like what are you guys's responsibilities over there? [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=184.48s)]
*  So Tucson sectors is the largest sector in the Border Patrol and so I had about 4,000 employees under my purview [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=186.24s)]
*  Wow, and that was about [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=191.57999999999998s)]
*  3,400 sworn law enforcement officers and then the rest were administrative folks mechanics [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=194.64s)]
*  Technicians Intel analysts radio operators, you name it. There's a full gambit behind it the day-to-day operations [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=199.5s)]
*  in the height of [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=206.54s)]
*  Operations there in Tucson. We were arresting about 500 to a thousand people a day and that that includes [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=208.54s)]
*  Like looking at the news right now. You're dealing with unaccompanied children [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=215.02s)]
*  Families and then that's about 30 maybe 40% of the work of the workload right now, right? [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=218.46s)]
*  And then the rest are all single adults criminal aliens. You've got everything from [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=224.06s)]
*  Pedophiles rapists narcotic traffickers heading in coming in. Yeah Wow. So is it and so man [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=229.26s)]
*  there's just it's so much like such a [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=237.42s)]
*  It's just a lot it seemed it just seems like a lot is it [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=241.06s)]
*  Or so someone comes into the country, right? [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=244.46s)]
*  Someone's coming in illegally and I say that just because that's the you know [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=246.98s)]
*  These are the there's a lot where you have to have some rules and the rules are if somebody's in a place for not supposed [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=250.72s)]
*  To be then we're just gonna use the term illegally. So is that okay with you? Absolutely. Okay, that's I mean that's and that's the appropriate legal definition [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=256.24s)]
*  You've entered the country illegally, right? [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=263.18s)]
*  Yeah, like if I went somewhere they would say that to me if I went to a country where I wasn't or I wasn't like didn't [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=265.2s)]
*  Have the paperwork done to be and then they would say you're here illegally [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=269.92s)]
*  So if someone comes across and you guys apprehend them is it apprehend like what do you guys do you guys take them in you? [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=273.72s)]
*  Facility do you immediately like take them back across the border like what kind of happens? [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=281.44s)]
*  So it's interesting about border enforcement is I think what happens with middle America is there's there's a perception [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=286.59999999999997s)]
*  I don't know if you've been down to the border or what you take on the border is but I think a lot of America looks [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=292.94s)]
*  At the border through the eyes of what they've seen on the news [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=297.71999999999997s)]
*  You know, you look at San Diego you look at El Paso and they show an urbanized border [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=300.5s)]
*  You got cities on both side and fencing and demarcation a lot of what the Border Patrol deals with is [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=305.2s)]
*  Everything in between out in the middle of nowhere rugged mountains desert it just [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=310.28s)]
*  There is [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=316.36s)]
*  I've worked in places where there's next to nothing out there in regards to infrastructure [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=317.84s)]
*  It's just you and your closest backup is 10 or 20 miles away and you're in the middle of nowhere Wow [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=321.52s)]
*  And so we employ and I have to get away from the Wii because now I'm retired [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=326.12s)]
*  But the Border Patrol employs a whole myriad of tools [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=329.56s)]
*  infrared cameras ground sensors [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=332.96s)]
*  We've got one of the largest air fleets and then the US government and the law enforcement realm [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=336.56s)]
*  So you've got blackhawks? [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=341.24s)]
*  assortment of helicopters [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=343.4s)]
*  Unmanned aerial vehicles and so I mean you're using all these different assets to track somebody [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=345.4s)]
*  Hopefully to prevent but to track them once they enter the country [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=350.8s)]
*  So you see someone say say someone's out on patrol right on an actual patrol and then they see someone crossing into the country [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=353.4s)]
*  Do they like tag them or like do they [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=360.84s)]
*  What do you do like do you apprehend them is it I mean I would it almost has a [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=366.76s)]
*  Like a freeze tag type of vibe. I feel like at a certain point it is it's almost like a game of cat and mouse, you know [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=371.84s)]
*  So I'll give you two scenarios. Okay in an urbanized area where we've got [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=378.44s)]
*  You've got fencing or no El Paso. You're saying like El Paso even places like Douglas, Nogales, Arizona [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=382.64s)]
*  Douglas Nogales, Arizona. Yeah, San Diego. You've got fencing or wall [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=389.24s)]
*  You know under the Trump administration to change from fencing to wall, right? [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=394.28s)]
*  And those locations we've got a lot of fixed cameras [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=398.2s)]
*  these are cameras that are up on on large poles and so you've got agents that are monitoring and watching and [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=401.12s)]
*  Some of the technology that plays into these cameras also detects does change detection [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=406.56s)]
*  So if it's watching the fence and all of a sudden there's a change in that picture [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=410.84s)]
*  The operator who then will call the agents out in the field and then that agent he or she [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=414.6s)]
*  Will respond to the area or maybe they're watching with binoculars and they see him crossing over the fence through a hole [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=420.04s)]
*  So they'll respond and then they'll make the arrest [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=425.16s)]
*  It's [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=427.68s)]
*  Apprehension arrest it's all the same thing. Okay [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=429.16s)]
*  And then the second scenario is as I described about the middle of nowhere and that's more of the norm [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=432.52000000000004s)]
*  you're out there and what happens is you may have a ground sensor that goes off somewhere near the border and [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=437.72s)]
*  You learned [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=442.84000000000003s)]
*  Psychologically as human beings you're looking for the easiest path of resistance [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=445.84000000000003s)]
*  So you learn the psychology of where people are going to try to cross? [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=450.08000000000004s)]
*  Okay, and then you're also dealing with one of the things that we can talk about this shortly is you're dealing with a criminal element [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=452.88000000000005s)]
*  That's very [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=458.0s)]
*  Effective and I use the term the professionals at what they do smuggling people. Okay, and so they'll begin [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=459.40000000000003s)]
*  Trekking north into the US and what agents will do is they'll find a spot where they can make the arrest [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=465.96000000000004s)]
*  It's it's beneficial to them [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=470.82s)]
*  And they'll track them the sensors are lined up in such a manner that you can track the movement of a person or a group [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=472.86s)]
*  of people [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=477.82s)]
*  You may use infrared scopes [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=479.02s)]
*  You may call on someone up in the air to track the group of people as they move along and then you're rolling to make [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=480.66s)]
*  That arrest [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=486.7s)]
*  So if there's a so it sounds like there's a lot of capabilities to know when and where people are coming [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=487.8s)]
*  So it sounds great, right? It sounds like all these tools all these assets [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=493.18s)]
*  But until you're out there and you get a true idea of just how [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=497.88s)]
*  It really is a needle in a haystack because some of the areas that we work in I'll speak to Arizona [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=501.52000000000004s)]
*  you have these arroyos and canyons and [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=507.36s)]
*  Brush and so you may have I may have a camera an infrared camera [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=510.68s)]
*  That's gonna pan this way and if the ground was flat and there was nothing to obstruct the view [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=514.52s)]
*  Easy, right? [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=519.36s)]
*  but because someone can drop into a canyon these canyons can go for miles or [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=520.44s)]
*  Climb up into a mountain and hide in a cave your window of opportunity for arrest is very short [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=524.6s)]
*  So the agents when I say they position themselves [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=529.7199999999999s)]
*  they're finding an area where they have great technology coverage and they know the ins and out of that area so when they [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=532.1999999999999s)]
*  They go to arrest these people if they scatter and run which happens quite often [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=537.36s)]
*  They know where to work towards to bring them into custody. Wow. It's got to get you out there. Yeah, you thought you would love it [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=541.4399999999999s)]
*  I've heard yeah, I've actually got all four we had Tommy Lahren came on as a guest one time and she is like, you know [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=547.88s)]
*  She's like real [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=553.88s)]
*  She's big on the border on border control, you know, she's a favorite of border patrol [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=555.56s)]
*  She's one of the first that went out to the border and invested herself [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=559.0s)]
*  And excuse me invested herself and got to know the border the border patrol what's going on, right? [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=562.72s)]
*  She's a strong advocate and a lot of the agents really really love her. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, she's a strong [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=567.4399999999999s)]
*  Yeah, she's definitely strong advocate, but she offered me to go sometimes. So yeah, I would love to go sometimes [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=572.12s)]
*  so I have an idea because I just see like [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=576.72s)]
*  snippets here and there and it seems like [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=579.84s)]
*  You know a lot of the border gets politicized a lot, you know, like you see a lot of [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=582.5600000000001s)]
*  like you'll you hear a lot of like Oh caravans are coming or [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=587.0s)]
*  Children are being separated from their parents or their families like take me into some of that scenario [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=592.0400000000001s)]
*  So like if you apprehend a family then what happens? [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=597.9200000000001s)]
*  So everyone who's apprehended and I'll walk you through from the point of apprehension to getting into the station and in some cases [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=600.5600000000001s)]
*  Criminally prosecuted or released or returned? [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=606.5999999999999s)]
*  There's a couple scenarios as soon as that arrest is made the agent and what we have to recognize is that [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=608.68s)]
*  We're still dealing with a criminal element, right? [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=614.4399999999999s)]
*  So it's just like any law enforcement officer [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=616.68s)]
*  He or she goes to that whole procedure of pat down checking bags and whatever else and you're dealing with people from not only [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=619.3199999999999s)]
*  Well, I think most people think about [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=626.0s)]
*  Illegal immigrants as being from Mexico or Central America and that's that's the focus right now, right? [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=628.56s)]
*  But the reality is is we see people from [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=632.8s)]
*  Everywhere throughout the world really Syria Somalia Egypt Russia you you you excuse me Ukraine you name it [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=635.4s)]
*  People from those countries are coming here [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=643.28s)]
*  And and they're coming to the boat through the through the southern border. Yeah [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=645.64s)]
*  The [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=652.0799999999999s)]
*  And I often say this [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=653.68s)]
*  What gets lost on the public is border security is truly national security, right? [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=655.5999999999999s)]
*  We're dealing with cartels and this is a multi-billion dollar industry [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=660.52s)]
*  It's not a couple hundred dollars or a few million [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=664.8s)]
*  It's billions of dollars that are generated in trafficking and smuggling of people and narcotics [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=666.88s)]
*  Wow, the power and the leverage that these these trafficking organizations have is tremendous, you know [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=671.0799999999999s)]
*  And we can talk about this in a little bit [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=676.8399999999999s)]
*  But on the Mexican side one of the things that we have to contend with is corruption, right? [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=678.16s)]
*  And when you have an organization a criminal organization that's pulling in billions of dollars [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=682.12s)]
*  You know dropping five thousand or ten thousand dollars in the pockets of a Mexican official to look the other way is nothing [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=686.4s)]
*  Yeah [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=691.5999999999999s)]
*  So this multi-billion dollar industry [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=692.28s)]
*  Has a drive has a need to keep that that that money coming in [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=695.4399999999999s)]
*  Yeah, so the agents are contending with you've got unaccompanied children [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=700.0799999999999s)]
*  And and when we say this I want to paint the picture a lot of these unaccompanied children are young men between the ages [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=704.0s)]
*  Of 15 and 17. Okay, I'd say about probably half of them and then the rest [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=708.8s)]
*  Are everything from a 12 year old? [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=713.28s)]
*  One of the things I see frequently is you'll have [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=717.0s)]
*  Eight or nine year old with a younger sibling who's about five or six and sometimes a two or three year old with them [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=719.2s)]
*  And they're traveling thousands of miles by themselves [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=724.42s)]
*  To our border and then coming across and it blows my mind. I've got an eight year old and I could imagine [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=728.22s)]
*  Yeah saying here. Here's here's a phone number when you get to the US call this number and somebody's gonna come and find you [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=735.88s)]
*  I couldn't imagine sending my child out on this journey by himself [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=741.0600000000001s)]
*  Oh, we had a four-year-old when I was growing up that that wandered over to our house like from the neighbors [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=743.76s)]
*  they used to do a bunch of drugs next door and [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=749.4s)]
*  He knocked on the door. He said he was going to the dollar general. He's like four years old [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=752.2s)]
*  We're like, you're not going to the dollar like this gives out of his mind [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=755.76s)]
*  It's like two miles away, right? This guy's you know, so we sent him home man [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=758.4s)]
*  But so but yeah, I can't even imagine like a kid going a really far distance out it and it's hot over there [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=761.9200000000001s)]
*  I mean I lived in Tucson for a while dude. It is it's spicy. Oh, yeah, take it back [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=767.1s)]
*  So if you're leaving from Guatemala El Salvador Honduras, you're traveling a couple thousand miles two to four weeks [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=772.0s)]
*  Think about a six-year-old or an eight-year-old doing this by himself or maybe with a group of other kids [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=778.32s)]
*  What happens between the the moment they leave their house till they get to the border and when you get to the border you're right [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=783.32s)]
*  There's the dangers of just the environment by itself the Rio Grande the desert the heat well the heat and the cold it'll kill you [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=788.28s)]
*  Either or that's a good point. Then you have people that will take advantage of these kids [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=794.44s)]
*  Yeah, and one of the things that just breaks my heart because I've seen this countless times [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=798.24s)]
*  You get kids that are rented because one of the things that happens is if you present as a family unit [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=803.4s)]
*  Here's Roy mom a couple kids. I'm gonna get released and so what we're seeing was kids being rented [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=808.8s)]
*  mmm, and and so you've got a [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=815.6800000000001s)]
*  Parent back in Guatemala who rents their child for $1,500 and that's a tremendous amount of money in Guatemala. Yeah [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=817.96s)]
*  and so the kid is brought to the border put in with [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=823.52s)]
*  Pseudo family sits in detention and then is released and then a handler a smuggler picks up this child [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=828.4s)]
*  Plyas and back to Guatemala Wow, that's that's the best case scenario, right? Right [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=835.04s)]
*  What happens with kids that just disappear and we saw this happen? [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=839.2s)]
*  As soon as you identify that child because it would take one or two sometimes three times before the the system would pick them up [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=843.0s)]
*  Because not all children are fingerprinted [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=849.2s)]
*  And once you've identified them in you, you know, you latch onto this group and you expose it [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=851.8s)]
*  If you can control and get that child back into the hands of the parent [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=856.7800000000001s)]
*  When if you can't if that child happens to get released with that family and then the smuggling organization realizes that the child is now blown [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=860.5s)]
*  Right. I don't know what happens to them [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=867.1800000000001s)]
*  Yeah, it's like is it worth to them fly get him out getting them a plane ticket or a bus ticket back to? [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=869.7800000000001s)]
*  Guadala Guatemala. Is it worth or is it just? [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=874.94s)]
*  Cheaper for them, especially after they've already been doing a lot of dirty business, you know [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=878.86s)]
*  To just well not care or get him into something else even worse. It's a business that doesn't care about the person [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=884.3s)]
*  It's it's it's a business that's driven by money. So [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=890.5s)]
*  Whether it's trafficking whether it's returning to the family best-case scenario and or becoming an indentured servant [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=893.42s)]
*  You know working in some sort of industry being sexually trafficked. All of those are realities of what we see at the border. Yeah [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=898.84s)]
*  Yeah, I've met I mean I've I myself have [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=905.18s)]
*  Been involved with escorts and you know that sort of thing. We had a sex worker on here one time [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=908.22s)]
*  I've met [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=912.9s)]
*  girls before [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=914.62s)]
*  That have been presented as escorts and you can that I've just been like, oh there's something is not right with this scenario [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=917.54s)]
*  You know, this is not um [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=923.66s)]
*  This is not somebody who's involved in this because they want to be involved in this, you know [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=925.8199999999999s)]
*  That kind of sounds kind of sad to say yeah [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=929.8199999999999s)]
*  And it's interesting because we'll have such adamant like people speaking so outspokenly about sex trafficking in America [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=931.22s)]
*  But the same people that seems will be speaking about opening the borders up [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=938.1s)]
*  But it's like it just seems so uh, I don't know. It's like it. How do you know that the people coming across aren't [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=942.26s)]
*  Like yeah, it could be pretending that that that's their daughter, you know [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=950.14s)]
*  I'm pretending that that's their mom like you just don't really know the scenario, huh? [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=953.86s)]
*  No, and the thing about it when I talk about these criminal organizations each [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=957.42s)]
*  trafficking organization [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=961.8199999999999s)]
*  Cartel owns a certain segment. They've got [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=963.9s)]
*  The [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=965.9s)]
*  Cartel bosses that own plazas their plaza bosses [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=968.14s)]
*  So, you know, it could be five miles or ten miles of an area [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=971.18s)]
*  And so when you come up to the border you're paying a tax in order to cross in that area on that side on yeah [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=973.86s)]
*  From from the Mexican side of the US side. So I mean and when I talk about billion dollar industry [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=979.48s)]
*  So Mexican national he or she is gonna pay between the cheapest would be about 2,500 all the way up to about five grand [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=984.26s)]
*  Central American five to ten grand an Indian national the tax they're paying on the Mexican side [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=990.06s)]
*  Well, this is to get smuggled, right? Oh, you get smuggled. So you get to the border [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=996.42s)]
*  This is part of your smuggling fee. You're paying a total fee of let's say it's ten ten grand, right? [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=1000.2199999999999s)]
*  Okay, but then when I show up at the border this plaza boss says [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=1004.06s)]
*  You know, I know you paid Roy to come across but you haven't paid my tax yet [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=1007.5s)]
*  So now you owe me five hundred or three hundred eight hundred dollars to cross here [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=1011.5s)]
*  So you have to keep that money on you on your person while you're going across the border [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=1015.66s)]

*  The thing is [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=1122.58s)]
*  With each segment as you're getting paid along well, you're not in other words. I'm paying you you're the organizer, right? [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=1124.78s)]

*  And if you can hear birds this is our new studio so there's our first attempt in this new place here gorgeous [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=1148.46s)]

*  Hey, hey Roy, I'm visiting the great free state of Texas from Michigan and my question is [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=1157.52s)]
*  What is one thing that you want people to know about the border that the media won't tell you? [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=1163.64s)]
*  Gang, maybe so that's a good question. Yeah, what do you what's something that that people don't know? [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=1169.4s)]
*  What's something we don't know is like a regular citizen? [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=1175.2800000000002s)]
*  Unfortunately, there's so many things but I mean realistically the [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=1179.3600000000001s)]
*  The greatest thing that I think the public needs to understand is that it's not just about [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=1182.16s)]
*  Illegal migration. It's not just kids or families [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=1188.5600000000002s)]
*  It's the the greater threat that's posed by these criminal organizations [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=1192.8400000000001s)]
*  I mean when you've got a multi-billion dollar organization that [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=1196.5600000000002s)]
*  Controls the border that can move people commodities freely. That's problematic. Yeah [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=1200.48s)]
*  It feels very problematic as like a someone who's just in a place like [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=1207.08s)]
*  Yeah, be scary if I left like a window open at night [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=1210.7199999999998s)]
*  And I knew that people outside of the window had a very strong business and wanted things to come in my window [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=1213.52s)]
*  Oh, absolutely, and they're gonna do whatever it takes to get it done. Wow [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=1219.1599999999999s)]
*  These aren't [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=1223.1999999999998s)]
*  They're not doing it for altruistic, you know good-natured purposes. They're doing it for the mighty dollar [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=1224.9599999999998s)]
*  Do you have uh, do you ever have a problem with the border? [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=1229.7199999999998s)]
*  Mighty dollar do you have uh, do you ever have compromised employees on your side? Yeah, unfortunately it happens [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=1233.04s)]
*  The reality is again get back to you be hard to do [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=1242.9s)]
*  So I'll give you two scenarios. The reality is the money is there [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=1246.68s)]
*  and so [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=1250.68s)]
*  People that are recruited in the border patrol and we've got people from all over the United States [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=1252.56s)]
*  Some some of which such as myself who were born and raised near the border [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=1256.52s)]
*  See and you work in the border environment you got folks that come from back East [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=1259.78s)]
*  Michigan places like that that I've never experienced the border and they get down there and it's just this culture shock and [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=1264.78s)]
*  we [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=1270.42s)]
*  in in border patrol parlance, we used to call it a [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=1271.78s)]
*  10-4 scenario which is a police code for everything's okay 10-4 [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=1275.38s)]
*  But you call it a 10-4 because here I am [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=1279.82s)]
*  I'm a four walking into a bar and this 10 comes up and starts hitting on me [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=1281.92s)]
*  Well, what she's doing is she's working you to corrupt you and so I've seen a couple [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=1285.6599999999999s)]
*  Circumstances where that's happened. So the reality is is there corruption or can corruption happen? Yes, right, but the it's easier in [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=1290.3999999999999s)]
*  Mexico than it is in the US [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=1298.34s)]
*  Simply because of the pay is different. It's also culturally accepted in Mexico [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=1300.34s)]
*  One of the sayings down there's plumo plata [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=1305.62s)]
*  Give me a [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=1309.1399999999999s)]
*  Give me a silver or give me a bullet [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=1310.78s)]
*  Silver being money right and so, you know Mexico's been changing working towards getting away from corruption [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=1312.74s)]
*  But it's still a reality of the environment down there. Yeah [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=1318.3400000000001s)]
*  We've also had it's a real dark force over there. You're not really just up against the people that are coming across [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=1322.7s)]
*  You're up against the possibility of those people [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=1328.38s)]
*  Not just being like people fleeing for a better life. You're up against the possibility of those people being criminals [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=1331.9s)]
*  and then you're up against the the [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=1337.9s)]
*  The both of those being fortified and supported by [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=1341.4599999999998s)]
*  By billions of dollars by by a really a strong running business by dirty money. But yes, absolutely Wow [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=1345.6999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, you know the other aspect too is we've had cartels pay people [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=1352.1999999999998s)]
*  To join the board of clean record get them to join the border patrol and then and then use them for information [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=1356.26s)]
*  Enforcement routes and stuff like that to pass goods. So it's it's an everyday threat. It really is so [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=1363.8999999999999s)]
*  What about like so Trump had a plan to build the wall, right? [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=1371.1799999999998s)]
*  So that was like a thing that was really big that he spoke a lot about did they start building the wall? [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=1375.06s)]
*  Do you feel like the wall was gonna be effective? So looking at Trump's wall [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=1381.5s)]
*  Again 32 years of doing this when I first came into the border patrol [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=1387.3s)]
*  There was very little infrastructure along the border. It was strands of barbed wire if it was even up, right? [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=1390.4199999999998s)]
*  I remember being in a high-speed pursuit and I'm driving down off the freeway [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=1395.7s)]
*  We get into into the the dirt and we're driving through these ravines and stuff and had it not been for another agent yelling out [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=1399.98s)]
*  To me to stop I would have driven right into Mexico [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=1405.5400000000002s)]
*  Oh really there was nothing to demarcate the US in Mexico. Wow, this is late 80s early 90s [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=1407.5400000000002s)]
*  So is a different world then gonna Oh, absolutely. Absolutely [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=1412.74s)]
*  We were arresting anywhere from a million a million a half people a year and every night it was high-speed pursuits [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=1415.3000000000002s)]
*  Foot chases we were catching a thousand people a night and that's just in one little station, right? [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=1420.46s)]
*  I used to laugh because when I first joined the border patrol [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=1424.74s)]
*  I remember walking into a station and there was a somebody had a shirt up shirt for sale on the back of it was an [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=1427.34s)]
*  Agent laying face down with footprints on his back [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=1432.18s)]
*  What does that have to do? And he's like just get out in the field. You'll see and sure as heck you're just getting overrun [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=1434.78s)]
*  Every day it was really crazy. Absolutely crazy. So almost like playing Red Rover or something and they're just coming. Oh, yeah [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=1439.6200000000001s)]
*  Yeah, they would so if you [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=1445.6200000000001s)]
*  Google it or look on YouTube and you go back to late 80s early 90s in San Diego [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=1448.6200000000001s)]
*  That was the epicenter of everything illegal migration and what the [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=1452.8200000000002s)]
*  migrants would do and the smugglers would do is they'd line up on the Tijuana side of the border and [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=1458.18s)]
*  They would watch the agents and there weren't a lot when I came to border for about 2,500 of us when I retired in December [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=1462.42s)]
*  There are about 20,000 of us. So we've grown tremendously but even that's you know, it's just it's not enough to cover the border [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=1468.8600000000001s)]
*  So it's increased bomb was 10 by 10 fold and that's along the entire border [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=1474.5600000000002s)]
*  Yeah, both the southern border and the northern border [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=1480.1799999999998s)]
*  So we've got about 16,000 eights on the southern border and just under 2000 on the northern border and that gets forgotten, too [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=1482.6399999999999s)]
*  There's a threat up there on the northern border. It's different, but there's still a threat up there. Right? Do you [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=1488.62s)]
*  When you have like a family that comes in oh it let me get back to that just to the Trump wall [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=1494.7s)]
*  So the wall was it being built it was right one of the things and this is often [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=1499.94s)]
*  I think we talked about the media and you know you get a certain sound bite [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=1504.22s)]
*  So the media doesn't give you the full understanding or picture what we're talking about, right? [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=1508.3s)]
*  When we were talking about the border wall, what it is, it's a border enforcement system [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=1512.2s)]
*  It's the wall. But more importantly, it's access to the wall. It's infrastructure. It's a road that leads to the wall [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=1517.56s)]
*  It's a road that parallels the wall so you can patrol its power its technology [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=1523.1399999999999s)]
*  It's it's this full package, right? And so people often again they think about the border as being this [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=1527.74s)]
*  Urban area that you can just drive it up to and and patrol very easily [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=1535.26s)]
*  When you go out into the mountains in the deserts you need access and what building the the wall did was it gave us access to [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=1538.9s)]
*  certain locations [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=1544.86s)]
*  So looking at Trump's border wall [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=1545.9s)]
*  There was some new wall that was built and then more importantly there was replacement wall and I often laugh because people like well [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=1548.74s)]
*  It's not wall. It's not new wall. Well when you get a new pair of shoes, you don't call it replacement pair of shoes [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=1554.7s)]
*  It's right a new pair of shoes, right? [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=1559.5s)]
*  So we we have new wall built was about I think was 450 miles of wall that was built [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=1561.1s)]
*  Wow, yeah, that's a decent amount [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=1566.4199999999998s)]
*  It's a decent amount and the thing about this too is what the wall does is we looked at and we analyzed the border patrols [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=1568.1s)]
*  Where can we put wall that effectively shapes the environment for us so that we can make a we deter people from coming into the US [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=1575.1s)]
*  Mm-hmm [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=1581.54s)]
*  And then more importantly if they do elect to come into the US where can we shape it so that it's advantageous to us? [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=1581.9399999999998s)]
*  To make an arrest right? [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=1586.8999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, cuz there's so much cost to that go into like just getting people out of like the middle of nowhere and getting them back [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=1588.82s)]
*  to a location [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=1595.54s)]
*  And I just can't even imagine all the costs that go into a lot of that [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=1597.8999999999999s)]
*  So the wall now are they finishing the wall? Are they stopping the wall? Do they know? [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=1601.1799999999998s)]
*  No, so so the when Biden came into into his presidency the new administration put a stop to all wall building [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=1606.1s)]
*  Which is very short-sighted and I say it because of this so in building the wall [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=1614.4199999999998s)]
*  It's not like they start at point a and then to be and then to see what they did is it's a and B here [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=1619.1s)]
*  And M&N over there so that you have areas that are open [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=1624.12s)]
*  So, you know, they'll go in the clear out existing fencing or they'll grade for new wall [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=1626.6s)]
*  And then they're building in certain segments and building to finish the wall [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=1631.1s)]
*  So we've got in just in Arizona itself. They're probably about 300 gaps [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=1635.32s)]
*  Some of which were [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=1640.74s)]
*  as small as [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=1642.34s)]
*  50 feet some as wide as a quarter mile [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=1644.3799999999999s)]
*  And other areas where the wall was built up to a point where you put a gate in and you need gates [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=1646.46s)]
*  To go back and forth because you have to do maintenance on the fencing on the walls and sometimes rescues and I'll talk to you about [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=1651.6599999999999s)]
*  That here shortly, so they didn't finish these gates. So now you've got 300 [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=1657.06s)]
*  gaps in the wall, which means 300 vulnerabilities Wow 300 places that smugglers can push people across and [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=1661.3799999999999s)]
*  One of the tools that smugglers use and [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=1667.7199999999998s)]
*  Really upset me [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=1671.6799999999998s)]
*  So we had families and unaccompanied kids coming across what these organizations would do is they would charter [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=1672.7199999999998s)]
*  Three to six buses they drive them out to the desert because on the Mexican side their freeway parallels the border [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=1677.12s)]
*  On the US side other than the cities. There is nothing on our side of the border nothing, you know anywhere from jeez [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=1683.56s)]
*  I would say 30 to 80 miles before you hit any sort of infrastructure from the US-Mexico border [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=1690.56s)]
*  So these smugglers they'd hire chartered these buses [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=1696.3799999999999s)]
*  They drive up 100 300 families and kids and they drop them off in the desert and push them into the US [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=1699.02s)]
*  Knowing that our technology was gonna pick up this this event and then it would take us [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=1705.58s)]
*  24 to 40 hours because it's again in places they were dropping off in places where we had very little access or infrastructure [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=1711.74s)]
*  So it would take us 24 to 40 hours to get four by four vehicles into these areas and load up the kids load up the families [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=1718.1s)]
*  Drive them to a place where we could then get a van or a bus and then drive them to a station [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=1724.4399999999998s)]
*  And so when this happens and it's done strategically again, this is about making money, right? Right? It's done strategically [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=1727.76s)]
*  So you drop this group off here and then I've got to close [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=1734.3799999999999s)]
*  Operations for in this particular location. I shut down a whole station, which is about [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=1738.36s)]
*  450 agents and I dedicated all of those agents to getting these kids and these families out of the desert because [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=1743.08s)]
*  What's gonna happen the heat or the cold is gonna kill them [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=1749.2399999999998s)]
*  And so when your manpower is dedicated to this then you get segments of the border that are wide open and what happens [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=1751.96s)]
*  They run drugs through there. They run criminals through there. So it's all about making money. It's it's it's a cat-and-mouse game [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=1758.2s)]

*  uh, I was in san diego prior to going to tucson and uh, [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=1962.8200000000002s)]
*  San diego at one point was accounting for about 60 of all hard narcotics meth coke fentanyl. Oh, wow san diego [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=1966.5s)]
*  Crazy a lot of it come through the ports and then some of it come between the ports [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=1972.9s)]
*  But in arizona it started to pick up and the difference in arizona's was they're making these little blue tablets fentanyl tablets [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=1976.26s)]
*  Which is much easier to smuggle and transport than you know bricks of the stuff [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=1982.5s)]
*  So you would get and the way these guys operate is it's just phenomenal [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=1987.1399999999999s)]
*  Um, so the scenario described right here's the diversion. I send a group of three guys [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=1990.58s)]
*  Three to five all of them with the backpack all of them carry well [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=1995.14s)]
*  The way they would work it is the first guy would have [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=1998.66s)]
*  20 30 pounds of marijuana, right? [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=2001.54s)]
*  Next guy food and supplies the third guy would have the fentanyl and he would be carrying [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=2003.38s)]
*  Probably 10 to at the most 20 pounds of fentanyl and then the other two guys maybe meth coke something else [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=2008.66s)]
*  And so this group of five would come running across the border [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=2015.14s)]
*  We would hope that we would pick them up [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=2018.26s)]
*  You know if we're not [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=2019.54s)]
*  What we try to do is not get so distracted that we have completely avoided everything because you again we had air assets technology [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=2020.74s)]
*  until you'd see this group and then [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=2027.54s)]
*  the the the group had the five guys the first guy his job was to get arrested right so that [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=2030.02s)]
*  You have to deal with then [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=2036.98s)]
*  Dealing with him and the and the guy with the fentanyl his job was to get away and the other [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=2038.18s)]
*  Four guys would do everything in their power to make sure that he got away. Dang [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=2042.42s)]
*  It's like plenty of kids in city chiefs almost kind of [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=2045.86s)]
*  You know, it's almost like planning against andy reed in a way, you know what i'm saying like they're coming with a plan [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=2048.74s)]

*  Spit it out here and my mind's racing because there's so much I like to say but you know [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=2065.94s)]
*  I talked about the industry but one of the things that that also happens like these five guys that are coming across [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=2069.46s)]
*  they're gonna hike for [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=2074.18s)]
*  30 to 80 miles through the desert [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=2076.3399999999997s)]
*  So these cartels have logistical [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=2078.66s)]
*  Waypoints along there where they they pay somebody to haul in food and water fresh batteries [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=2081.54s)]
*  And so they're set up in the desert in the mountains there. So as this group comes along they're watching [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=2087.06s)]
*  So they got two jobs one is to resupply and then the second job is to watch us [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=2092.1s)]
*  And it is it's it's a bear to catch them [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=2096.5s)]
*  I mean in order to to arrest these guys at one point we did surveillance for probably four to six months [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=2098.8199999999997s)]
*  Identifying all the spots right and then we brought in um, we brought in a whole slew of air assets [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=2104.7400000000002s)]
*  Blackhawks and everything else and we brought in our boar tack, which is like our swat team [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=2113.2200000000003s)]
*  Yeah, and a boar star which our search and rescue team all these guys are badass. Yeah [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=2117.62s)]
*  And uh, so we pinpointed all these locations. We coordinated with the mexicans and you know, I mentioned corruption [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=2121.94s)]
*  So we had to coordinate with mexico city to bring out a a vetted unit that we could trust [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=2126.98s)]
*  And so that you know, they they did the blocking on the mexican side that so these guys couldn't run south and get away [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=2131.94s)]
*  And then we flew all these teams in at each of these spots and they'd repel down [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=2137.7799999999997s)]
*  And they're running the mountains and make these arrests [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=2141.22s)]
*  But you know the amount of money and effort that goes into it's insane men this but the unfortunate part is [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=2143.54s)]
*  You give it a week [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=2148.9s)]
*  Maybe maybe a month [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=2150.1s)]
*  And then they're right back in business and so then you have to replicate this you have to start watching them and tracking them [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=2152.18s)]
*  And it's just crazy [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=2156.18s)]
*  Can you tag them or something or shoot them with like a dart so you know where they are they don't allow that no [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=2157.78s)]
*  No, see that's ridiculous to me a little bit like it's almost like especially for the guys who are doing the smuggling [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=2162.5s)]
*  Can you uh, because we'll tag a goose, you know what i'm saying to find out where he's having an egg [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=2168.82s)]
*  But you won't tag somebody who's freaking just running [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=2173.3s)]
*  You know like anything across the border [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=2176.42s)]
*  Um, do they have what about the smugglers if you catch a smuggler? [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=2179.1400000000003s)]
*  Can you prosecute them is there prosecution against them? There is [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=2182.7400000000002s)]
*  So one of the things that's evolved over time is it used to be the smuggler [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=2186.18s)]
*  Or the guide would come across with that group and you'd make the arrest and then you could work towards a prosecution [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=2189.94s)]
*  Uh, we also you have to recognize that we're competing with all the other federal agencies to get a prosecution [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=2194.26s)]
*  So, you know probably one out of three cases gets prosecuted [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=2198.42s)]
*  Why because some of them and there's water right there too if you need it, right? [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=2201.7000000000003s)]
*  Um, because so you're competing with them to get a prosecution. Yeah, in other words, so the u.s attorney [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=2204.66s)]
*  um [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=2210.58s)]
*  His or her office can only they only have so many attorneys so they can only present so many cases [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=2211.54s)]
*  So they're looking for the best of the best cases [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=2215.3s)]
*  And you're dealing you're competing with dea fbi u.s marshals, but they all want the clout from it. You mean well [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=2217.7000000000003s)]
*  You want a winning record, right? If i'm a uh, u.s attorney [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=2224.26s)]
*  I want to have a record that's 100. No, I want to win every doggone case [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=2227.62s)]
*  I present right and I also want to take the sexiest cases, right? [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=2230.42s)]
*  I don't want the simple joe blow case. I want a case that gets headlines [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=2233.46s)]
*  I want a case that's going to make me look good, right? So when you've got [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=2236.5s)]
*  And every day, I mean you've got a tremendous amount of cases you can come up with [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=2240.58s)]
*  I want to hand pick i'm going to cherry pick the best case because I want to win [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=2244.34s)]
*  And I want to get a good a good name behind myself. Oh the smugglers [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=2247.94s)]
*  So they'll try and prosecute the best smugglers the best smugglers or [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=2250.34s)]
*  A smuggler that's tied to a particular organization. Um, you know, so that again [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=2254.02s)]
*  This is back in the day when you get these guides in these smugglers now what's happening with technology everybody has a cell phone [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=2258.02s)]
*  Uh, and some of the locations the cell phone service has gotten to the point that it [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=2263.78s)]
*  Virtually touches every part of the border now [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=2267.86s)]
*  Which means they can communicate they can pull up they can track as they're moving along [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=2269.86s)]
*  So smugglers will sit in mexico [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=2273.94s)]
*  And uh, they'll text okay, you're gonna walk for a mile. I'm watching you when you get to this [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=2275.94s)]
*  Point you're gonna turn left. You're gonna walk for three miles and then you'll get to this mountain [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=2280.5s)]
*  You're gonna get you're gonna get door dash. Yeah, like yeah, it's just getting it's crazy. And you know, we we try to employ technology and there's [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=2283.94s)]
*  um [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=2290.9s)]
*  There's certain types of technology some of which I can't talk about but [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=2292.02s)]
*  That we employ when we when we're working cell phones and stuff like that stuff that can jam cell phones track cell phones [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=2295.38s)]
*  and more importantly, um [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=2301.06s)]
*  One of the things that happened with with the trump administration is he so the president gets to declare [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=2303.86s)]
*  His uh his top priorities and for the longest time immigration and border enforcement was it wasn't even on the radar screen [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=2308.9s)]
*  With president trump it was in the top five. I think it was number three [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=2315.62s)]
*  and as a result of that we got access to um [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=2318.98s)]
*  a bunch of agencies that have [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=2322.82s)]
*  Techniques skills tools technology that goes well beyond what we've ever experienced [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=2325.38s)]
*  Wow that really enabled us to start painting a better picture along the border [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=2329.8599999999997s)]
*  um, you know everything from looking at uh [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=2333.22s)]
*  It was kind of very frustrating because you would look across the border because a smuggler sits here [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=2336.98s)]
*  And he's watching you knowing that you can't do anything to arrest him unless [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=2340.8199999999997s)]
*  I shouldn't say that [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=2345.7799999999997s)]
*  Very far fuel between you get to arrest that guy because you have to work with the mexicans [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=2347.3799999999997s)]
*  And like I said, some of these guys are paid off and then you have to build up a case go to mexico city [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=2350.98s)]
*  and then sometimes you get the arrest but um [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=2354.8999999999996s)]
*  The the ability to do is just [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=2357.06s)]
*  I wish it was better [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=2359.62s)]
*  Um to be able to actually process these guys. Yeah, because really it's just a lot of return. So is it a lot of just returning them? [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=2361.62s)]
*  It is so so you know going back to the beginning of our conversation [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=2367.86s)]
*  Unaccompanied children. There's a process for them that you know, we [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=2372.18s)]
*  Take their information a lot of them show up. They have a phone number [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=2375.7s)]
*  Uh written down somewhere a piece of paper [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=2379.14s)]
*  You'll contact that person and then you start and you work at the consoles of those countries whether it's mexico or or [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=2381.14s)]
*  Guatemala and you start backtracking to identify who the child is if they have family in the u.s [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=2386.98s)]
*  And how you can connect them with that family and they're they're released from our custody into um [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=2392.5s)]
*  Another organization that does the housing and the feeding until they can get them into a relative or a parent's hands [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=2397.94s)]
*  Okay [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=2403.38s)]
*  And in some cases when it can't be done then they work towards getting them back to their [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=2403.86s)]
*  Their uh family and whatever country they're coming from. Okay, that's kids family units are usually processed and then they're released into the u.s [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=2407.62s)]
*  Um, so like if a mother and a couple of two children come in and a father [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=2415.2999999999997s)]
*  then they're processed and released into the u.s. Yeah, and [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=2420.5s)]
*  Where do they have to go back to max or they can just stay so and this is what's uh [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=2425.46s)]
*  Looking at 2014 looking thinking about the the viewer's question there [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=2430.42s)]
*  One of the things that's happening right now is that up until about 2010 2014. I think is more realistic [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=2434.3399999999997s)]
*  Most people coming across are single adults, right? Yeah, so they're arrested [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=2440.5s)]
*  Um, some are prosecuted some were just simply returned back into mexico [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=2444.26s)]
*  In 2014 people began to realize that they could exploit the asylum loophole [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=2447.94s)]
*  In other words, I come here and I say theo I want asylum, right? [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=2452.26s)]
*  And because of that i've got to process you and then i've got to release you and when I release you now you have access to [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=2455.54s)]
*  state aid [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=2461.06s)]
*  Uh, you get a work authorization and you may not have a hearing for five years [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=2462.1800000000003s)]
*  And that's if you elect to show up and a lot of people don't show up for their hearings [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=2466.9s)]
*  So they don't necessarily qualify for asylum. Um, and I think that's [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=2470.02s)]
*  It's one of the shortfalls of this because you you've really [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=2474.82s)]
*  um you [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=2478.1s)]
*  Bastardize the definition of asylum and for those that truly need asylum now [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=2479.78s)]
*  They've become one of a million people asking for it and you've you've taken that away from them, right? [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=2483.6200000000003s)]
*  And at the same time now these folks are using the system against [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=2488.7400000000002s)]
*  The system in order to benefit from them from it. Excuse me. And so the family units they come in they ask for asylum [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=2492.58s)]
*  Uh, they get into the u.s and they disappear [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=2498.42s)]
*  Wow, you know your criminal aliens they get prosecuted and again, we have folks that um, [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=2500.98s)]
*  Robbers rapists narcotic [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=2506.66s)]
*  Traffickers you name it and you know, they'll get prosecuted for what's either illegal entry or reentry [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=2508.82s)]
*  Um or being an ag felon and they can get anywhere from a year to some upwards of 10 years [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=2514.18s)]
*  In uh in prison. Yeah, but then that's we have prison that we have to take care [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=2519.46s)]
*  It's like it's still on the american tab really. Yeah [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=2524.5s)]
*  Um, have you had to release people that you know or crimp it like release people just into the country and you're like [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=2527.14s)]
*  This I should not be releasing this person [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=2532.8199999999997s)]
*  But there's nothing I can do about it like that's out of your [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=2535.94s)]
*  Yeah, they're um [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=2539.22s)]
*  I've never had to release like a hardcore criminal, right? [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=2540.9s)]
*  You're gonna do everything in your if you've got a hardcore criminal and you know, that's a bad dude, right? [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=2543.06s)]
*  You can do everything in your power to make sure that he's either returned to mexico or there's some [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=2547.22s)]
*  Legal resource you can use i.e. maybe he's got a warrant [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=2552.66s)]
*  Some sheriff department or something so you can get them picked up and held and then prosecuted, right? [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=2555.54s)]
*  You do everything in your power to do that. But I think what uh, like looking at today right now with the situation at the border [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=2560.5s)]
*  um [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=2566.42s)]
*  It's a crisis. Is it a crisis? Oh, absolutely. And i'll tell you why it's a crisis [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=2567.54s)]
*  There's a focus on kids. There's a focus on family units. Um, so in 2019 we had [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=2572.82s)]
*  We had a border crisis then and what made it a crisis was these two populations families and kids [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=2578.98s)]
*  What they do is they cause the system to just come to a complete grinding halt, right? [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=2584.1800000000003s)]
*  Because there is no law enforcement entity in the world that's designed to house [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=2588.82s)]
*  Or care feed children and families, right? You know, so we often heard, you know negative backlash about all [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=2592.98s)]
*  You know, it's inhumane treatment and x y and z but nobody's situated for that. But when you get [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=2600.1000000000004s)]
*  I think it was 100 almost 200 000 family units and something like 80 000 accompanied children when you put that into the system [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=2606.7400000000002s)]
*  That's not designed for it. It just it stops. It's gridlocked and then everything else falls apart behind it [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=2613.22s)]
*  You can't prosecute you can't house criminal aliens [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=2618.66s)]
*  So the system will collapse [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=2622.2599999999998s)]
*  It's a crisis on multiple fronts first and foremost [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=2625.3799999999997s)]
*  Because it's not being addressed [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=2629.3799999999997s)]
*  The flow is going to continue right? You know the unfortunate part and for the border patrol [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=2631.22s)]
*  We're apolitical, you know, we're we're [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=2635.94s)]
*  Worked for 32 years under different administrations [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=2638.3399999999997s)]
*  Every administration, you know you you give them the facts you tell them what what's going to what you think is going to work [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=2641.2200000000003s)]
*  What's going to benefit and then you step back and then you know you fall in the line [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=2645.94s)]
*  This administration was briefed on if you reverse these programs if you take these steps [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=2651.1400000000003s)]
*  This is what's going to happen and uh, unfortunately sure shit. That's what happened [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=2657.38s)]
*  so so we're in a space right now where it's uh, do you feel like it's [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=2662.02s)]
*  How how bad is it right now compared to what it's been like during your tenure? [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=2666.7400000000002s)]
*  so in 2019, um [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=2670.82s)]
*  So like you mentioned the caravan earlier and that was the first of its kind [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=2673.2200000000003s)]
*  We had something like 10 20 000 people. This is a few years ago [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=2676.34s)]
*  You remember that honduran caravan there was all of this like there was pictures and there was like some of the pictures were even [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=2679.54s)]
*  stolen images from um [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=2685.3s)]
*  Hotel rwanda. I remember I remember seeing one and it was like a bunch of black guys with machetes [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=2687.46s)]
*  And i'm like, I don't think this is the same thing [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=2691.94s)]
*  but um [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=2694.34s)]
*  That was a big thing [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=2695.38s)]
*  How much of that was just like a political football kind of being kicked around and how much of that was like an actual [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=2696.42s)]
*  Group of people on the way. Oh, so it started out [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=2702.42s)]
*  It was multiple groups of a couple thousand and then the biggest group was something like 8 000 [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=2707.06s)]
*  And then they they convened together first it was honduras and then al salvatore got on board then guatemala [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=2710.98s)]
*  And so when these groups convened together they they were close to 20 000 [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=2715.7000000000003s)]
*  When they hit the mexico border and this is when uh, the u.s put pressure on mexico [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=2720.02s)]
*  Mexico made an effort to stop them [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=2724.58s)]
*  But it wasn't a concerted effort. It wasn't like we're absolutely going to do it [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=2727.14s)]
*  And then there was some writing at the mexico guatemala border and then eventually the crowd pushes through [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=2729.86s)]
*  and then what happened as they progressed through mexico was um [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=2734.82s)]
*  Cities decided that they didn't want you know, who wants 20 000 people camped out in your city [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=2739.06s)]
*  So cities started um chartering buses and they would start moving these folks along [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=2743.38s)]
*  and then when they got to mexico city they housed them in a big stadium there in the style and uh, [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=2747.46s)]
*  Medical care food everything else and that was and offering them jobs [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=2752.74s)]
*  That was one of the things that they that they did was hey look if you're looking for work [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=2756.3399999999997s)]
*  We've got work. We'll give you a work permit. We'll get you set up [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=2760.18s)]
*  And everybody was pretty much in town on getting to the u.s [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=2762.8999999999996s)]
*  um [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=2765.7799999999997s)]
*  So then they began and this was all being organized and it was i mean facebook and people were giving them cell phones [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=2767.3799999999997s)]
*  So then they got on the move again so wild and la bestia the the train that goes comes up from southern mexico [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=2773.62s)]
*  To the tip of south southern texas mccallan rio grande in that area [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=2780.82s)]
*  That's what this group was planning on taking free ride dangerous as hell, but free ride to the border [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=2784.98s)]
*  So we got the mexican government to stop the train. Wow, and then that caused this group to [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=2790.02s)]
*  To rethink what they were going to do so they started moving towards, uh, arizona towards california [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=2794.7400000000002s)]
*  And so when they got to california, I was in san diego at the time they got to san diego it was [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=2800.5s)]
*  Along the way they had broken up some went into south texas some went into um, [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=2804.82s)]
*  Arizona and then a large group went all the way up in san diego and it's about 12 000 strong [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=2809.22s)]
*  And uh, they were held up in tijuana a lot of the mexican people didn't want them there. Wow [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=2813.7799999999997s)]
*  And again, it's just it's this large group of people that are showing up on your border that you're having to house and feed [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=2819.06s)]
*  And care for yeah, and then what comes with it crime, right and some of it's directed at the migrants [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=2823.4599999999996s)]
*  I mean there it's a population that can be easily exploited [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=2828.2599999999998s)]
*  so, you know when we talk about what are some of the things that happen, I certainly [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=2831.14s)]
*  I worry about you know, it's a population that we're having to contend with we're gonna have to arrest [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=2835.14s)]
*  But you also worry about these people because right because they're still human human beings. Yeah [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=2838.58s)]
*  A lot of times what I saw in the span of my career when I first came on board the border patrol [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=2844.34s)]
*  We were kind of vilified, you know, there were coritas mexican songs written about these hard ass border patrol agents [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=2849.14s)]
*  And you know fast forward 30 years [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=2855.54s)]
*  Before I left I was at the border with some of my agents and there was a group of uh, [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=2858.98s)]
*  Hondurans and this mom and her two daughters came across [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=2863.78s)]
*  And brought them to cusp and I walked up just to talk to him [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=2866.9s)]
*  I want to keep you know right from the horse's mouth in regards to what was it like [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=2868.98s)]
*  And I started talking to mom and she starts crying and the little girls run up and they grab my leg [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=2872.82s)]
*  And uh, you know, it chokes me up thinking about it [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=2878.1800000000003s)]
*  It was and after she calmed down I said why are you crying and she goes [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=2882.34s)]
*  Because I know i've made it and I know that i'm safe because i'm in your arms [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=2885.7000000000003s)]
*  So the the mentality of these folks is they're doing this dangerous trip from wherever they're coming [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=2890.0200000000004s)]
*  But they know that the minute they get into our custody the minute they see the border patrol [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=2895.06s)]
*  They've made it to the u.s [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=2898.7400000000002s)]
*  And that they're safe and going to be cared for and it was just it was the crazy [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=2900.1000000000004s)]
*  Craziest experience for me because I again when I first started it was like, well, I don't want to be there to the border patrol [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=2904.02s)]
*  To i'm running for you and I i'm embracing you. It's just crazy [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=2908.98s)]
*  man, it's uh, [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=2913.6200000000003s)]
*  Yeah, it's so tough because it's like [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=2915.86s)]
*  I have so much like human empathy, you know, just like you know, like um [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=2918.5800000000004s)]
*  Sometimes almost too much I feel like and then it's also tough like um [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=2923.3s)]
*  You know a business that doesn't because america really is a business, you know [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=2928.34s)]
*  As much as we like to think that it it's also a group of people who are trying to [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=2931.46s)]
*  You know, it's a society. It's a structure, but it's definitely has its ledgers for sure where everything is, uh, [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=2935.6200000000003s)]
*  You know accounted for but then you get into this [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=2941.46s)]
*  It's you know this it feels like just a lot of inventory that nobody kind of really [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=2944.98s)]
*  Is writing down, you know [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=2950.58s)]
*  Are we getting a lot of people in that we don't really know that you know, we don't have like paperwork on um, absolutely [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=2954.5s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely. So [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=2961.14s)]
*  One of the things that you have to look at is you're talking about an unfettered flow of migration in the u.s [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=2963.46s)]
*  Prior to 2018 2019 [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=2970.82s)]
*  Annual apprehensions were three to four hundred thousand. Okay a year a year across the whole border across the whole border [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=2973.38s)]
*  Okay. So again looking back to 80s and 90s when it was over a million million and a half [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=2979.14s)]
*  Tremendous improvement, right now. We're almost we're in that 700 to a million a year again [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=2984.2599999999998s)]
*  So this is this unchecked unfettered population surge that's coming across every year and that's what we encounter and apprehend, right? [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=2989.54s)]
*  You know, it's it's hard to guesstimate what's getting away from us [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=2996.58s)]
*  When you're distracted when you have agents that are distracted [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=2999.62s)]
*  On families and kids that are giving up and then caring for them [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=3002.18s)]
*  What's getting by us right so you know every year there's probably [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=3005.94s)]
*  Minimally 500 000 maybe upwards of 2 million people that are coming across illegally [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=3010.9s)]
*  And coming into the u.s that we don't know who they are [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=3015.3s)]
*  Um, you know one of the things with the current situation in covet is we also have to recognize that covet has impacted these countries [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=3018.1s)]
*  Probably much more severely than it has the u.s. You know, the medical capabilities aren't aren't the same as they are here in the u.s [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=3024.82s)]
*  right [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=3030.98s)]
*  So you're getting a population of people that are coming into the u.s [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=3032.82s)]
*  We're not doing covet testing on them. So you have the the potential of [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=3036.5s)]
*  Another resurgence of covet in the u.s [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=3042.1800000000003s)]
*  Part of what happened when covet started back, you know last year [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=3044.98s)]
*  Is we implemented what's known as title 42 which is the ability to when you come across I make the arrest and I expel you [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=3049.3s)]
*  Immediately, I don't bring you into a station [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=3055.46s)]
*  I my goal is to get you back across the border and out of the u.s as quickly as possible to minimize that exposure [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=3057.2200000000003s)]
*  And they that was started during covet. Yeah. Okay. So prior to that it was you're arrested [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=3063.78s)]
*  Driven to a station processed and with covet it was you don't even come into the station and we get you out of there [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=3068.98s)]
*  It was that kind of nice. That's great [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=3074.9s)]
*  But the only problem with it is that so when I came to the border patrol in 88 [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=3076.9s)]
*  We were just arresting people you'd process them and you'd return them right back to mexico [[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=3081.94s)]
*  And then you'd see them again in the same shift or the next day [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=3085.94s)]
*  So it was just a constant revolving door [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=3088.3399999999997s)]
*  With with title 42 we're kind of there again because all the courts are shut down. So there's no prosecution [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=3090.98s)]
*  There's no deterrent. You can't house them. So you put them back on the border and the smuggler says hey [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=3096.5s)]
*  I'm taking you back across, you know, you paid me [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=3102.8199999999997s)]
*  I'm going to get you back across and they just keep on doing this [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=3104.58s)]
*  So until we get the the court system turned back on [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=3107.2999999999997s)]
*  and then I think unfortunately until the biden administration recognizes that [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=3111.22s)]
*  They are [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=3115.3s)]
*  Their actions and their words [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=3116.74s)]
*  Are having an impact they're driving illegal migration until that changes this is going to continue [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=3119.06s)]
*  So when we talk about crisis, I mentioned the system coming to a grinding halt, but the bigger issue is that [[00:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=3123.78s)]
*  There isn't enough from this administration saying [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=3129.38s)]
*  You can't come here, right? You know, you're going to be prosecuted or [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=3133.14s)]
*  the the reality behind this whole thing is and people may find this [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=3136.18s)]
*  Quizical thinking you know, here's an enforcement officer, but our immigration system has to be revamped [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=3140.98s)]
*  And you have to think about this as it's it's a whole system the enforcement part and the legal part [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=3145.94s)]
*  If you fix the legal part [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=3151.46s)]
*  Then that enables the enforcement part to focus on the true criminals the really bad elements when you have a legal system that's [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=3153.2200000000003s)]
*  Messed up and it's not working [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=3160.6600000000003s)]
*  Well, that's when you get all these people that take the illegal route and then it just burdens border security [[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=3161.78s)]
*  So, you know i'm a strong advocate of whether it's this administration or the next one [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=3167.38s)]
*  Somebody has to come in and fix our immigration system as a whole really but they can't do it half-assed [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=3171.7000000000003s)]
*  You can't focus on the legal part not the enforcement part or you can't take apart the enforcement part [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=3176.42s)]
*  And then bolster the legal part you need to do it simultaneously so that you've got this [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=3181.14s)]
*  Immigration system this umbrella that works. Well [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=3185.46s)]
*  So it's a really a two-armed deal, huh? Oh, absolutely. Does it feel uh, [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=3189.3s)]
*  Futile sometimes like the how do you guys maintain that morale if it seems yeah, what does it feel futile? [[00:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=3193.38s)]
*  it does one of the things i've been talking to some of the agents that are still out in the field and [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=3200.1800000000003s)]
*  It's uh, you know [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=3204.6600000000003s)]
*  It's the antithesis of what you've been trained and what you've been doing for your careers [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=3206.02s)]
*  Arresting people and removing them from the country or prosecuting them and now you're arresting them and you're releasing them into the country [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=3209.84s)]
*  The other thing too is when you release them a lot of what's what's not being reported is the impact on the border communities [[00:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=3217.38s)]
*  Right. Oh, I think about that a lot of times like if you're a family that has a house there [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=3222.6600000000003s)]
*  20 years ago or something and you you know worked hard in a town and you you know provided for your family and you bought a home [[00:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=3227.38s)]
*  And then what's that like for them? Yeah [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=3233.94s)]
*  Yeah, so I mean you have the potential of driving the value of the home down, but the the greater impact is [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=3236.6600000000003s)]
*  When we look at the the title 42 thing [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=3242.7400000000002s)]
*  It was also about preserving our medical system in the u.s [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=3245.1400000000003s)]
*  Because we wanted to make sure that we had ample medical care for u.s [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=3248.6600000000003s)]
*  Residents right right right if you allow this population to come in it can overwhelm the medical system [[00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=3251.46s)]
*  Um, but when we have people being released at the border [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=3255.86s)]
*  So now you have to house feed care for you have to provide medical care for them [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=3258.42s)]
*  So some of these border communities are not equipped for that, you know [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=3263.1400000000003s)]
*  Not equipped for a surge of a thousand or twenty thousand people coming in on a daily basis [[00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=3265.6200000000003s)]
*  And so it overwhelms them. You know, they don't have the deep pockets to pay for this stuff [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=3270.98s)]
*  And right now the government's not doing anything to help them out [[00:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=3274.1000000000004s)]
*  Oh man, here's a question we had that came in right here [[00:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=3276.74s)]

*  It could even be emotional dangers that you feel so there's a whole realm of dangers [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=3318.58s)]
*  I mean honestly, so the cartels the criminals that's one in of itself [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=3322.8999999999996s)]
*  Uh, you're dealing with the environment. So if you're out there in the desert and you're hiking around [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=3326.42s)]
*  dehydration [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=3330.7999999999997s)]
*  hypothermia i've uh tragically [[00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=3331.92s)]
*  I've had a number of agents that have died from from uh dehydration. Um at age and hiking up [[00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=3334.32s)]
*  Patagonia mountain had a heart attack and died really. Oh, yeah [[00:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=3340.32s)]
*  So I mean the elements in of themselves [[00:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=3343.04s)]
*  Are danger and then you get the criminal aspect [[00:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=3345.52s)]
*  Um some of these guys they carry weapons some of them. Oh, yeah, I don't want to be taken into custody, you know, um [[00:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=3348.2400000000002s)]
*  And at one point particularly in arizona [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=3354.08s)]
*  We had ripoff crews. These were gang bangers coming from phoenix down to the border [[00:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=3357.12s)]
*  Laying in in the mountains or the deserts out there to rip off [[00:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=3362.08s)]
*  The uh the mules coming across with the dope and so, you know [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=3366.48s)]
*  We had an agent who got caught up in the middle of a firefight and got killed [[00:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=3370.4s)]
*  Um, and then you know, he mentioned wild animals, man. We're dealing with [[00:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=3373.76s)]
*  rattlers out there [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=3377.52s)]
*  um [[00:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=3379.2000000000003s)]
*  Pumas there's some serious animals out there. Yeah some buzzards [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=3380.64s)]
*  Oh, yeah [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=3384.0s)]
*  And then you got the you know, you go down to texas [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=3384.4s)]
*  You got the real ground and some places you walk right across at other places you it's dangerous as hell [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=3385.76s)]
*  Yeah, so I mean there's a whole bunch of things that can unfortunately law enforcement as a whole it's a dangerous job [[00:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=3389.7599999999998s)]
*  But there's a bunch of things that can kill you out there [[00:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=3394.72s)]
*  um [[00:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=3397.52s)]
*  what uh [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=3398.88s)]
*  when you [[00:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=3400.16s)]
*  It is it hard for border patrol agents like some of them whether they're to set aside any political beliefs [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=3401.92s)]
*  They may have and just do their job [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=3408.48s)]
*  Do you see any of that or most of the guys like you said administration just changes over time? [[00:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=3409.92s)]
*  And um, and you guys just kind of stay on the task at hand [[00:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=3414.56s)]
*  You know, it does bother you personally, of course, you know, you want somebody that's supporting your endeavors [[00:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=3418.2400000000002s)]
*  Um, but you don't take it to work. Um, you know again because we're gonna every four years [[00:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=3423.28s)]
*  You have the potential for working for a new boss, right and the rules can change every four years [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=3428.32s)]
*  What's uh, I think what's what's fortunate for the agent in the field is that you know [[00:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=3433.76s)]
*  You're tasked with enforcing the laws that have been legislated by congress, right? [[00:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=3437.84s)]
*  And so even though the president may not like those laws [[00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=3441.92s)]
*  It's the law and it's hard for him to change it or her to change it. Maybe someday [[00:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=3444.1600000000003s)]
*  Um, so you you try to stay apolitical, but it certainly bothers you when you're not getting support [[00:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=3447.6800000000003s)]
*  Does it um? [[00:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=3453.1200000000003s)]
*  does it [[00:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=3454.8s)]
*  So yeah [[00:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=3456.32s)]
*  So obviously laws have to change and it's a lot for things to actually change that would affect the way that you guys operate [[00:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=3456.88s)]
*  But you're saying that if it's not like maybe more vocal support [[00:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=3463.36s)]
*  uh from the media or from a president or from an office then [[00:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=3467.52s)]

*  Yeah, that colon cane that used to be the big thing people would like like swallow cocaine balloons. Do people still do that? Oh, yeah, so [[01:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=3663.68s)]
*  uh [[01:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=3671.12s)]
*  Every mechanism when I was working in el centro, this is uh, southern california [[01:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=3672.32s)]
*  They were uh, so every day across the border and the borders it's such a dynamic place [[01:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=3677.04s)]
*  If you haven't been there you need to go down there experience it [[01:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=3681.04s)]
*  And uh, but every day hundreds of kids cross the border to go to school [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=3684.1600000000003s)]
*  And so what these organizations had done is they took their school books [[01:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=3689.36s)]
*  They hollowed it out just big enough to put a key in there. And so here come these little kids every day [[01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=3692.96s)]
*  They'd walk across [[01:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=3697.6000000000004s)]
*  They'd walk a block down and there was a car, you know, they tell the kids you walk down [[01:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=3699.2s)]
*  There's gonna be a red Mazda windows gonna be down shove your book in there on the way [[01:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=3702.24s)]
*  Home from school walk through here. There's gonna be a blue Mazda doors open grab your book [[01:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=3707.12s)]
*  And so you would see this, you know until you catch on that trend, right? [[01:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=3712.7999999999997s)]
*  Here's these little kids dropping off a book, you know, it was an astute agent who's like what the hell are they doing? [[01:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=3716.08s)]
*  Went over looked in and there's you know, a dozen books in there. Yeah [[01:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=3720.72s)]
*  So so so kids get used a lot, huh? Yeah, because they're not going to get prosecuted. Uh, [[01:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=3724.08s)]
*  So they'll get used and uh to to bring that stuff over [[01:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=3729.68s)]
*  Uh, what's unfortunate in these kids that you know, they migrate to the next level right because they're already caught in the game [[01:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=3733.92s)]
*  It's not the game. Yeah. Yeah, and it's it's not it's not a pleasant game [[01:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=3739.12s)]
*  It's not the type of game where you can be like, yeah, i'm not gonna do it today [[01:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=3742.64s)]
*  You know, there's consequences on this other side and these aren't nice people. Yeah [[01:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=3745.2799999999997s)]
*  Man, it must be such a trying position that you guys are in then [[01:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=3750.72s)]
*  um [[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=3754.88s)]
*  Because you're the human [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=3756.16s)]
*  Element that's right there at the front [[01:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=3758.48s)]
*  so you [[01:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=3760.8799999999997s)]
*  it's like [[01:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=3762.72s)]
*  Do I have to follow these laws? [[01:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=3764.16s)]
*  But sometimes you're going to have to turn a kid over to an organization or to a country to an environment to a structure [[01:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=3766.96s)]
*  that doesn't [[01:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=3773.68s)]
*  Really care about it as much [[01:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=3775.3599999999997s)]
*  um [[01:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=3777.3599999999997s)]
*  Is there enough like [[01:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=3778.7999999999997s)]
*  by allowing [[01:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=3780.7999999999997s)]
*  Like some of the leniencies that we have here [[01:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=3782.3199999999997s)]
*  Are we [[01:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=3784.88s)]
*  Making it harder. Do we make it easier on these countries? Like do we make it less responsibility on these countries to police their own? [[01:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=3786.0s)]
*  you their own like um, not really police but to [[01:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=3794.6400000000003s)]
*  to run their own societies. Well, like are we [[01:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=3798.32s)]
*  alleviating like pressures on them to [[01:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=3801.42s)]
*  like if we stop things are they gonna have to [[01:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=3804.1600000000003s)]
*  Deal with would that leave more on their plate to deal with to actually get their get like a better act together [[01:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=3807.2000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, so there's cause and consequence. Um [[01:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=3813.6s)]
*  Sorry, it took me so long to ask too. I just it's hard to be smart sometimes and it's hard [[01:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=3816.4s)]
*  No, it hurts my neck [[01:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=3821.44s)]
*  There's certainly cause and consequence and one of the things you have to understand also is there's a culture there [[01:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=3823.36s)]
*  You know, you're you're you're dealing with a culture that doesn't necessarily match up [[01:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=3827.6s)]
*  Line for line with the u.s culture, right? You know what's acceptable there may not be acceptable here [[01:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=3832.4s)]
*  Um, you know migrating here from from mexico for the longest time. It was just part of [[01:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=3836.64s)]
*  Growing up you hit 15 16 you were expected to migrate to the u.s start working and send money back home, right? [[01:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=3842.64s)]
*  um, so there's a cultural thing that we're dealing with and then [[01:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=3848.48s)]
*  Anything we do on the u.s side certainly has a trickle-down effect is going to have some sort of reaction to mexico [[01:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=3851.44s)]
*  I dealt a lot with uh, again [[01:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=3857.3599999999997s)]
*  Mexican government from uh, their u.s attorney's office their federal police mexican military has a big part on border enforcement down there [[01:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=3860.16s)]
*  um, you know one of their complaints was when you know when you [[01:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=3867.2s)]
*  when you do [[01:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=3870.0s)]
*  Enforcement, you know, it's very one-sided and it has been for years and I felt guilty when I finally recognized it was mexican general [[01:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=3871.42s)]
*  we were we were at a meeting in tijuana and uh, [[01:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=3877.84s)]
*  I gotta tell you I always love meeting with mexican generals because it's it's just a [[01:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=3881.6s)]
*  it's a different world the level of treatment you get and we'll talk about culture in a second on that but um, [[01:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=3885.44s)]

*  You don't take the time and look at what's coming south. In other words, we're gonna send drugs north [[01:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=3898.56s)]
*  And this money is coming south and these weapons are coming south [[01:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=3903.12s)]
*  And the combination of the weapons and the money which buys the weapons [[01:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=3906.64s)]
*  Is messing up my my society. Mm-hmm. And tijuana was just it was a horrendous place for border violence for cartel action [[01:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=3910.32s)]

*  Okay, and we need the government, uh to step. I'm not about the government. We need congress [[01:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=3947.2799999999997s)]
*  We need the white house but more I think congress more anything kind of to [[01:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=3952.56s)]
*  To get in the game, right? Um, you know if I can be blunt it's congress needs to get its head out of his ass [[01:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=3956.32s)]
*  And start doing something right they have the power of the purse and the power to legislate, right? [[01:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=3960.96s)]
*  They need to apply [[01:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=3965.92s)]
*  The purse towards addressing this um helping with the kids and the family units they need to legislate [[01:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=3967.28s)]
*  They need to revamp the entire immigration system [[01:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=3972.6400000000003s)]
*  And uh, you know, I I applaud the bite administration for looking at you know, what do we do to invest in? [[01:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=3975.44s)]
*  The source, you know, where are these people coming from? Right? [[01:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=3981.28s)]
*  That's great and we always try to do economic redevelopment these countries [[01:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=3984.08s)]
*  But they have to recognize that you could you can't put a billion dollars [[01:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=3987.04s)]
*  In el salvador today and expect it to stop this flow, right? [[01:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=3990.4s)]
*  You have to recognize that it's going to take 10 or 20 years before that plan comes to fruition [[01:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=3993.84s)]
*  So in order to make things better, it's it's revamping the immigration system. It's helping some of these sending countries, but it's also having a very [[01:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=3999.28s)]
*  strong effective [[01:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=4007.12s)]
*  Immigration system that includes the border enforcement, right? [[01:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=4009.12s)]
*  You know, you just you can't undermine it and whether it's technology more agents more infrastructure, whatever it may be [[01:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=4011.6s)]
*  You need to secure that border [[01:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=4017.44s)]
*  Man so so you have to have the border you have to have the actual boots on the ground [[01:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=4020.64s)]
*  They need help and then the legislate you have to have better ways to legislate and just process things [[01:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=4025.12s)]
*  Congress has to do its job. I mean it really hasn't done anything towards [[01:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=4031.2s)]
*  um addressing the problem and a lot of what's going on right now is uh, [[01:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=4034.64s)]
*  Congress's fault from the last two or three years because a lot of the funding that was earmarked for um detention for remodeling detention facilities [[01:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=4039.44s)]
*  Was removed from the budget because part of the intent was to ensure that people were being released [[01:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=4046.2400000000002s)]
*  Okay, so now you fast forward two years and what's happening? We can't hold these people so we have to release them [[01:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=4050.72s)]
*  so it's it's a vicious cyclical game and [[01:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=4056.16s)]
*  I would just hope that our elected officials just focus on the problem it [[01:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=4058.96s)]
*  Not only for the humanity of these kids and these families but also for the bigger aspect of the border security [[01:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=4063.68s)]
*  You know one thing we didn't touch was terrorism. Yeah, I assure you [[01:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=4068.72s)]
*  And I can't speak to specifics because there's there's classifications behind it [[01:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=4072.64s)]
*  But there are folks that have terrorist ties terrorist training that are intent on hurting us that have come across our southern border [[01:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=4076.16s)]
*  So you're seeing so you definitely see people that you're like, oh, this is not a mexican person looking for asylum you see [[01:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=4082.56s)]
*  Right, yeah [[01:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=4089.36s)]
*  And you know and I mentioned the the amount of money that's charged these guys are paying big bucks [[01:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=4090.6400000000003s)]
*  And for like right after 9 11 a lot of the smugglers [[01:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=4095.76s)]
*  Refused to have anything to do with anybody that that came from the middle eastern country [[01:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=4099.42s)]
*  Just because they kind of painted everybody with a wide brush. You're probably a terrorist, right? [[01:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=4103.360000000001s)]
*  So even the smugglers had like a there was sort of a code of honor, right? [[01:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=4107.6s)]
*  But uh, you get away from 9 11 [[01:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=4111.84s)]
*  We kind of forget about it like man if you smuggle that guy and he's gonna blow up the country will have no place to smuggle [[01:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=4113.68s)]
*  Yeah, exactly [[01:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=4117.92s)]
*  But uh, but now it's just really open range, huh? It is to a degree [[01:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=4120.4800000000005s)]
*  I mean there are it's funny to think about this because it [[01:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=4124.0s)]
*  it to a degree it's almost a symbiotic relationship because you do have some smugglers who [[01:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=4127.68s)]
*  One thing that everybody despises is a pedophile, right? [[01:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=4132.8s)]
*  And uh, if they know you're a pedophile or you do something and they're missing they're hurting a kid or something [[01:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=4135.52s)]
*  if they don't [[01:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=4142.0s)]
*  Beat your ass or kill you they'll shove you across the border with a little note letting you know [[01:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=4143.36s)]
*  Who he is letting you guys know? Yeah. Oh wow [[01:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=4147.599999999999s)]
*  I've seen i've seen that on a couple occasions where somebody's left on the other side of the border tied to a tree or cuffed up [[01:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=4150.08s)]
*  And with a little note. Hey, this guy's a [[01:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=4155.36s)]
*  Check your records. Wow. So there I mean there's a little bit of street justice a little bit of ethics fun there [[01:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=4157.759999999999s)]
*  But they're still driven by the almighty dollar [[01:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=4162.0s)]
*  um [[01:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=4164.08s)]
*  and I would hope [[01:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=4165.12s)]
*  That as if it related to terrorist stuff that they would still refrain from it because it it harms both. Yeah [[01:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=4166.639999999999s)]

*  in the white shirt [[01:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=4359.5199999999995s)]

*  Uh, I got a question for your man roy [[01:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=4369.4400000000005s)]
*  How did he feel about the military? [[01:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=4372.96s)]
*  Joining up with the border patrol a few years back. I was down there [[01:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=4377.2s)]
*  with him out of fort nox [[01:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=4382.64s)]
*  I just wanted to know what his opinion on that was [[01:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=4385.6s)]
*  Oh gang brother. Thank you, man. Um [[01:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=4389.4400000000005s)]
*  Do you uh, yeah, what was that like was it is it nice when other organizations are on board does it get a little sticky? [[01:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=4392.88s)]
*  Is there like kind of like a lot of posturing or is it pretty fun sometimes? Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. So [[01:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=4397.36s)]
*  It's it's very sticky. So, you know, we got posse comatades which prevents the military from taking any sort of uh, [[01:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=4403.44s)]
*  Enforcement action. So anything that they do for the border patrol is um support. Okay, so when I say support, um, [[01:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=4408.7s)]
*  They can fix our vehicles. Uh, they can run our scopes like our you know, our infrared cameras they can run [[01:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=4416.88s)]
*  uh, they can do uh lpops listening post outpost where you'll put a [[01:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=4421.759999999999s)]
*  Group of uh, it's it's a great training environment along the southern border. So sometimes they'd send out [[01:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=4426.0s)]
*  Snipers and they'd put them up on a hill and they would stay there for two weeks at a time and they would just report stuff to us [[01:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=4431.74s)]
*  Um, but everything they do is just about support. It's not actually put hands on or anything [[01:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=4437.28s)]
*  So to answer the question [[01:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=4443.12s)]
*  Absolutely loved having the military on the border because it freed up [[01:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=4444.96s)]
*  Agents to go and actually do patrol work, right? [[01:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=4448.96s)]
*  Plus it was a great training environment for our military [[01:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=4451.44s)]
*  so that you know that mission readiness for them when they go across the pond and then the bigger aspect is there was there was [[01:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=4453.44s)]
*  always this exchange of of information and um, and and and know how because [[01:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=4458.64s)]
*  Some of the things we'd learned from them, right? But the biggest part was uh, the building of infrastructure [[01:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=4464.4s)]
*  I mean they come in and they fix our roads or build roads for us and [[01:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=4469.2s)]
*  Again to be able to get to the border helps win that battle [[01:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=4472.56s)]
*  Yeah, it's just so interesting to hear you say that about that wall about the fact that it was going to also provide [[01:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=4475.84s)]
*  Like that there was that there was electricity with it that there was like just a little bit of infrastructure [[01:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=4481.92s)]
*  Especially out there in the middle of nowhere [[01:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=4487.2s)]
*  um [[01:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=4489.36s)]
*  That probably just would have helped so much [[01:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=4490.96s)]
*  I'm inviting you come out to a terrazona. I'll take you out there. Yeah, you'll be shocked [[01:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=4493.44s)]
*  We'll we'll drive from an urban area and we'll drive three maybe five miles out and then all of a sudden you're in the middle of nowhere [[01:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=4497.36s)]
*  Yeah, and there's no border infrastructure. There's no power. There's nothing [[01:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=4502.56s)]
*  And again, I think middle america just has no concept of what the border really means. I mean you're you're out in the middle of nowhere [[01:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=4506.64s)]
*  I mean i've driven through west texas and that even gets like, you know, even on i-10 or whatever that is [[01:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=4514.48s)]
*  Yeah, it's like that gets harrowing. I mean, I I know there was like one point about 45 miles [[01:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=4519.5199999999995s)]
*  Well, there's just no exit, you know, there's no [[01:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=4523.44s)]
*  If you need gas for something you already should have got it [[01:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=4526.08s)]
*  So yeah, I can't even imagine what it's like when you I mean and that's along an interstate [[01:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=4528.0s)]
*  Yeah, so I can't even imagine what it's like when you get kind of uh in a in a [[01:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=4532.32s)]
*  You're out in the middle of nowhere. I mean it's you maybe you have a partner [[01:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=4537.12s)]
*  Sometimes your partner jump sometimes you're not your partner could be 20 miles away and it's pitch black [[01:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=4539.52s)]
*  You're relying on your radio if you have radio reception [[01:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=4544.48s)]
*  Um, you know, and i've got agents that they're using four wheel four wheel drive vehicles atv's motorcycles [[01:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=4547.2s)]
*  Sometimes you're just hiking out and foot your parking vehicle and then you just hike [[01:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=4552.48s)]
*  Utv's you name it. I mean they're out there and they're doing the job in texas [[01:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=4556.88s)]
*  They're on boats, you know, and we still use horses, right? Um [[01:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=4560.48s)]
*  People laugh like why would you use horses? But they get you in and out of places that you can't do with the vehicle [[01:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=4564.879999999999s)]
*  Yeah, great resource and uh the horses, uh [[01:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=4568.719999999999s)]
*  I laugh because uh to them it's almost like a game [[01:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=4572.639999999999s)]
*  They get to the point where they're smelling and they hear people and they start getting giddy. You can fill them tents up [[01:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=4576.08s)]
*  a good friend of mine was on the horse patrol and uh [[01:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=4581.12s)]
*  He said he wasn't paying attention. He wasn't paying attention to his horse and let go of the reins. He was sitting there [[01:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=4584.24s)]
*  Bullshit with another agent and his horse heard a group of people over the next little hill [[01:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=4588.56s)]
*  Took off he fell off broke his arm by the time they got up to the horse [[01:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=4594.56s)]
*  The horse had circled up and basically made the arrest. Yeah, the horse is up there learning spanish and he's [[01:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=4598.0s)]
*  He's fixing his arm. Um [[01:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=4603.4400000000005s)]
*  What uh, so yeah with the kids is just such a god. There's just such a there's so many little elements going on there [[01:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=4605.84s)]
*  it's like [[01:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=4612.0s)]
*  It must pull on your heartstrings sometimes [[01:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=4613.2s)]
*  But are there other times where you just feel like the kids are being used and it's not about [[01:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=4614.96s)]
*  Um an actual like getting a better life for a child. Is there that that happens also? Yeah, you know, um [[01:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=4619.92s)]
*  The every day at the border there's there's so many different stories, um [[01:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=4627.76s)]
*  I think for those in law enforcement you go from being a social worker to a caregiver to [[01:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=4633.52s)]
*  To the cop right you run the full myriad of things you have to do every day [[01:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=4637.44s)]
*  and uh with kids it's just it's different because you're [[01:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=4640.96s)]
*  When you walk up and there's three little kids it's a 10 year old and a six year old and their two year old [[01:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=4643.84s)]
*  uh sibling it just blows my mind because you're realizing that [[01:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=4648.96s)]
*  This group of kids just traversed thousands of miles by themselves walked out in the middle of the doggone desert [[01:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=4653.52s)]
*  I shouldn't say walking. I mean somebody drove them up there and pushed them across the border [[01:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=4658.96s)]
*  And they're left out there exposed. Um, and sometimes they may have that phone number in their pocket [[01:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=4662.8s)]
*  Sometimes and i've seen it when they break it out [[01:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=4667.12s)]
*  It's gotten washed away because they you know, they were dirty or soiled or watered [[01:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=4669.280000000001s)]
*  You know, they were dirty or soiled or went through a river [[01:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=4672.4s)]
*  and then how do you find the parents, you know, and we've we've had cases where an [[01:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=4674.96s)]
*  infants newborns, they're just [[01:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=4679.12s)]
*  You got there and you find them that are there and [[01:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=4680.96s)]
*  What do you do? You know, how do you how do you track back the parents of this child? [[01:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=4683.28s)]
*  Yeah, and we've also had some some cool stories where [[01:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=4686.5599999999995s)]
*  Uh, this was in san diego where I don't know why mom did this but she handed her baby off to another guy [[01:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=4691.44s)]
*  And they're coming across the border and the agents went to make the arrest and she runs left and he runs right [[01:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=4696.5599999999995s)]
*  She didn't know who he was right [[01:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=4701.839999999999s)]
*  And we end up arresting him. She ends up running back into mexico [[01:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=4703.919999999999s)]
*  and uh, you know [[01:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=4708.08s)]
*  Start the processing asking the questions and he says this is my baby. I don't want you know here. I don't want it [[01:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=4709.679999999999s)]
*  And all of a sudden here we are with this newborn. We're thinking how do you where do you find mom? [[01:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=4715.2s)]
*  Wow, and this is when you work at the you know [[01:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=4719.12s)]
*  In this case it was the the mexican consul and and she happened to be from guatemala and the guatemalan consul [[01:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=4720.879999999999s)]
*  You get the word out and you get the word out to on the south side of mexico. There are organizations non-government organizations that [[01:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=4725.5199999999995s)]
*  Help these people um, whether it's food housing, whatever it may be [[01:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=4731.5199999999995s)]
*  And so you put the word out and you hope that mom is there right or that maybe if mom actually made it into the u.s [[01:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=4735.04s)]
*  Maybe she gets ahold of the consul and hey, we found found a baby in this particular case of two two days [[01:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=4740.48s)]
*  And mom finally came up and said hey, that's my child [[01:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=4746.08s)]
*  Describe the child to a t what the baby was wearing and we're able to reunite them [[01:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=4748.879999999999s)]
*  But you know that doesn't happen all the time. Yeah, you know and [[01:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=4752.879999999999s)]
*  tragically, uh every year there's [[01:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=4756.799999999999s)]
*  Two to five hundred people that die along the border really. Oh, yeah, it's it's a large exposure [[01:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=4759.4400000000005s)]
*  exposure, uh the dehydration hypothermia, um [[01:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=4765.4400000000005s)]
*  You know when they get to the border, they're not fully equipped and a lot of what they're told by the smugglers is [[01:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=4769.2s)]
*  Take a gallon of water. You're gonna walk a few hours and you're gonna be fine and you get to the border [[01:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=4773.6s)]
*  It's like okay, you're walking 80 miles [[01:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=4777.52s)]
*  Be very cautious with your gallon of water, right prepared for it, but you know, some people just chug it right in the beginning [[01:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=4781.04s)]
*  Oh, yeah, I mean we've seen cases where [[01:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=4785.2s)]
*  Uh aliens have got to the point that they're you know, they're they're drinking their own urine [[01:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=4788.32s)]
*  Yeah, you know and I mentioned the agents are out there in the same environment. Also. I had an agent who uh, he hiked all night [[01:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=4791.5199999999995s)]
*  He's he was tracking down a group his radio went dead beginning of summer. He ran out of water [[01:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=4796.799999999999s)]
*  um, he starts to get disorientated and uh [[01:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=4802.32s)]
*  This is uh, so this shift started at four o'clock [[01:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=4805.839999999999s)]
*  At about 10 in the morning. He realizes that he's just in dire straits. Dang and his radio's dead [[01:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=4809.36s)]
*  And so he goes out in the middle of the road [[01:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=4814.639999999999s)]
*  Writes a letter to his wife [[01:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=4816.96s)]
*  Takes off his uniform folds it up sets it down in the middle of the road [[01:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=4819.360000000001s)]
*  And he goes over and he gets under a bush because he's just expecting to die and he's looking for any shade and [[01:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=4822.64s)]
*  He's hoping that you know, the uniform is going to be seen by somebody flying over [[01:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=4826.88s)]
*  Uh when you lose communication with an agent after a certain we do uh, we'll call welfare checks on our agents, right? [[01:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=4830.8s)]
*  And uh, we couldn't find him and so we started this massive ground search and air search and thankfully, uh, [[01:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=4836.320000000001s)]
*  So this is like 10 o'clock. I think it was about one in the afternoon [[01:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=4841.6s)]
*  We found him and he was he said I was ready to go to god. Dang. Yeah, so it's it's a dangerous place but [[01:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=4843.76s)]
*  You know going back to the kids and the fact that there are 200 500 people dying on the border [[01:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=4849.68s)]
*  Yeah, that includes little kids trying to swim across the river that includes little kids walking through the desert and it's just it breaks my heart [[01:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=4854.56s)]
*  I I can't express to you that [[01:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=4860.64s)]
*  You get a little bit desensitized to it because you get exposed to it so often [[01:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=4863.4400000000005s)]
*  but uh, there's just so many times when [[01:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=4867.2s)]
*  Whether it's out in the field or i'd walk into a processing station and I'd see these kids sitting there and [[01:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=4870.08s)]
*  It would just break my heart because I would envision my kids, right? [[01:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=4874.4s)]
*  Is it the desperation of the families to for a better life in the u.s [[01:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=4879.92s)]
*  And we got to admit we have the best country in the world bar none, right? [[01:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=4882.48s)]
*  But it's the desperation such that you're going to put your child through this and expose him to this and it just it [[01:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=4886.4s)]
*  boggles my mind [[01:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=4891.28s)]
*  Yeah, that feels like such an intense move because i've been to some countries where [[01:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=4892.639999999999s)]
*  I mean, I think i've been to most of the countries where [[01:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=4898.08s)]
*  There's a lot of poverty and there's a lot of like not much structure in these even some where there's a lot of danger and fear [[01:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=4900.4s)]
*  But you still often see families [[01:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=4909.04s)]
*  Uh just moderate that the best to their abilities and also they don't know any better a lot of times [[01:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=4912.24s)]
*  And [[01:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=4919.44s)]
*  Yeah, I just couldn't imagine uh that that that that would be such a [[01:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=4921.12s)]
*  It would be such a [[01:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=4925.04s)]
*  A desire, you know, especially if you had children. Yeah, like i would almost be like let's just [[01:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=4927.6s)]
*  Manage what we can hear and be together then take this or or come across together, you know [[01:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=4933.2s)]
*  Yeah, that's that's one of the things that I understand if you're gonna send your kids go with your kid particularly right now [[01:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=4937.84s)]
*  Not that i'm advocating this right to anybody [[01:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=4943.4400000000005s)]
*  But if you know the family families are being released released why don't you come with your family? Yeah, right [[01:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=4945.84s)]
*  And yeah, how much of the responsibility ever falls on the parents too? [[01:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=4950.400000000001s)]
*  You know, it's like um, I hate to say that but I don't really it's like [[01:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=4954.0s)]
*  I would be upset as a child. I think if my if there were not responsibility kind of taken by my mom, you know, um [[01:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=4958.24s)]
*  And I know every instance is different. Yeah, look at the culture too. You know, there's this expectation but [[01:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=4964.88s)]
*  Not for a two-year-old four or six-year-old that yeah, a four-year-old can't even work at walmart or anything [[01:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=4969.68s)]
*  No, yeah, and you asked about the traffic aspect. Um [[01:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=4975.12s)]
*  two years ago, there was a case that came out of yuma, arizona where they identified something like [[01:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=4978.56s)]
*  I think it was just under a thousand kids that are being trafficked or cycled through [[01:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=4983.12s)]
*  and uh [[01:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=4986.8s)]
*  Here's one of the things that I think a big misconception is what happens at the border does not stay at the border, right? [[01:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=4988.4s)]
*  It's coming to every part of the u.s [[01:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=4993.5199999999995s)]
*  It's here in nashville. It's in new york city. It's in florida. It's in kentucky. You name it [[01:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=4996.0s)]
*  It's going there whether it's narcotics or illegal immigrants [[01:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=5000.16s)]
*  And in this particular case these kids were being trafficked and then the family units were also part of this trafficking [[01:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=5003.5199999999995s)]
*  And uh, so when they're getting released the usually either the mom or the dad were putting a bracelet on them [[01:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=5008.72s)]
*  And then what we're finding is as soon as they got to the greyhound station or the airport they would cut it off [[01:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=5015.28s)]
*  But we were tracking them and so we tracked them to three different locations [[01:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=5019.76s)]
*  And in each location where they would arrive [[01:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=5024.24s)]
*  so if they didn't cut it off at near the border they cut it off when they got to the to uh, to the state that they're in [[01:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=5026.96s)]
*  and uh [[01:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=5032.64s)]
*  They would get there and then the smuggler would bring them in and okay now you're part of this landscaping team [[01:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=5033.68s)]
*  You're part of this construction team. You're going to be a maid and you're going to work off this ten thousand dollars [[01:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=5039.280000000001s)]
*  Wow, so I mean they were slavery modern-day slavery right right in the midst of us [[01:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=5044.16s)]
*  Um, and the kids are part of that again [[01:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=5049.04s)]
*  It gets back to some of the kids being rented some of those kids would get there and then they'd be flown back [[01:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=5051.200000000001s)]
*  Right, you know and when we when we brought that organization down there was a female who was responsible for those kids and [[01:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=5055.360000000001s)]
*  It brought me so much joy to see her get prosecuted [[01:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=5061.04s)]
*  Man [[01:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=5064.96s)]
*  Oh, it's a lot [[01:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=5067.76s)]
*  It is it you know, again, I appreciate the opportunity [[01:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=5069.44s)]
*  There's just so much to that goes on with the border patrol and you know [[01:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=5072.24s)]
*  We haven't really talked about what the men and women do the tools they use. Uh, we've talked about a lot about the criminal aspect [[01:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=5075.28s)]
*  What's driving it? [[01:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=5080.64s)]
*  Uh, there's so much that goes on there and and again, it doesn't stay at the border. It's just yeah [[01:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=5082.0s)]
*  Yeah, no, that's the part that really definitely starts to scare me too. It's like [[01:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=5087.759999999999s)]
*  you know, um [[01:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=5091.759999999999s)]
*  It just seems futile like if we're gonna spend money to have this and you know, like we have a military that's [[01:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=5093.28s)]
*  Not sitting around a lot of times but on a lot of bases there, you know [[01:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=5099.84s)]
*  there there's [[01:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=5103.12s)]
*  they could use probably details and and things to do at times i'm sure some of them would love the opportunity even just go see [[01:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=5104.5599999999995s)]
*  the border and see what it's like and [[01:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=5109.599999999999s)]
*  um [[01:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=5112.08s)]
*  And if that would help relieve you guys it's just like yeah, why don't we try and use our assets better? [[01:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=5113.2s)]
*  um [[01:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=5118.88s)]
*  It used to feel like when I was growing up that there was a pride in like we're america and this is like, you know [[01:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=5119.599999999999s)]
*  we stand for our borders and that they mean something and then [[01:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=5124.72s)]
*  it feels like [[01:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=5128.5599999999995s)]
*  That that's kind of gone away or the media at least is also like really pushed that [[01:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=5130.16s)]
*  you know, uh, everyone has a right to be in america this sort of thing which [[01:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=5134.8s)]
*  Which is hard to contest because it's like how'd I get into america, you know, or how did you get how did any of us get here? [[01:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=5139.200000000001s)]
*  um, but at the same time it's like if you don't have some [[01:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=5144.96s)]
*  system of checks and balances where like some inventory, um [[01:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=5149.6s)]
*  You know there used to be a program [[01:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=5154.96s)]
*  I think where you could sponsor a family like a family that came in another family would sponsor the family [[01:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=5156.160000000001s)]
*  and so then you had like a tour guide into america kind of and there was like [[01:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=5161.52s)]
*  I feel like at least then there's some like social accountability within like a fabric work of the society, but [[01:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=5165.2s)]
*  I don't know man. I mean, what do you feel like is some type of a solution or something moving forward? [[01:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=5172.0s)]
*  It's the legal aspect. It really is it needs to be revamped. Um, you know what you described about programs [[01:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=5176.96s)]
*  Refugee programs are well established. So where you're sponsoring refugees as they come in in different category from an asylum seeker, right? [[01:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=5181.76s)]
*  But there are programs for that where it's whether it's a church group or a particular individual that supports that refugee and then helps them [[01:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=5188.4800000000005s)]
*  assimilate and you know [[01:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=5194.54s)]
*  Become part of america [[01:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=5196.879999999999s)]
*  Really we the key is legal migration, but it's got to be a system. That's just much more effective and efficient [[01:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=5199.04s)]
*  um [[01:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=5205.28s)]
*  the reason people start coming across illegally is [[01:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=5206.48s)]
*  You may apply legally but it's going to take you three to five years, right? [[01:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=5210.719999999999s)]
*  And then the categories again a lot of what we have are unskilled labor, right? Um, you know [[01:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=5214.08s)]
*  I agree with one thing that president trump did talk about was [[01:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=5219.839999999999s)]
*  If we're going to bring people in why aren't we bringing in more skilled labor? [[01:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=5222.96s)]
*  You know, we're not we're not the country that we used to be 40 50 years ago [[01:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=5226.24s)]
*  We had a great demand for unskilled labor, right? We have a greater demand for skilled labor your technology folks, you know stuff like that [[01:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=5229.679999999999s)]
*  So if we're going to do this it has to be revamped so that it's addressing the particular types of skills that we need [[01:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=5237.12s)]
*  But it's also done in such a manner that it's just it's effective [[01:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=5243.12s)]
*  It's we live in a world where we want things now, right? [[01:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=5245.679999999999s)]
*  Nobody wants to wait two or three years and that's part of what's driving this illegal migration is [[01:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=5248.719999999999s)]
*  If I apply legally a I may not qualify b it's going to take me forever [[01:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=5253.04s)]
*  And then c right now if I come across illegally, i'm gonna get released at least that's the mindset [[01:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=5256.96s)]
*  That's what we're seeing on on social media and chatter and debriefs that we do with the folks we encounter [[01:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=5261.679999999999s)]
*  And that's some of the stuff that's really the worst because that's how people are [[01:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=5266.639999999999s)]
*  Learning about it and getting inspired really like now's the time, you know [[01:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=5269.599999999999s)]
*  Oh, yeah. Yeah, I mean they're they're on social media facebook instagram twitter. It's out there [[01:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=5272.639999999999s)]
*  Yeah, they they feed this and and I mentioned earlier [[01:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=5277.2s)]
*  Smugglers use those avenues to promote it too. So that's so crazy, man [[01:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=5281.68s)]
*  so I worry like a lot of times like in my life I are [[01:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=5285.92s)]
*  Just i'll try to it's hard to make things fair in the world, you know [[01:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=5289.84s)]
*  It's really tough and i'm sure in your job you guys have this real semblance of like what's fair here, you know [[01:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=5292.64s)]
*  um, but then also it's like you have the laws that you have to uphold, um, but I start to worry like [[01:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=5297.84s)]
*  like [[01:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=5305.12s)]
*  If a lot of people come into the country and they are allowed to be here and then eventually become citizens [[01:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=5306.16s)]
*  Then it really just kind of favors the democratic party to let them in because then eventually there'll probably be democratic voters [[01:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=5313.5199999999995s)]
*  it feels like [[01:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=5320.5599999999995s)]
*  which i'm not saying that like [[01:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=5321.76s)]
*  no shade against either a democrat or a republican or [[01:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=5324.08s)]
*  Libertarian or paul revere anybody, you know, but um or poncho via anyone, you know [[01:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=5327.66s)]
*  But it doesn't seem fair kind of like it almost seems like it would behoove like uh, [[01:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=5332.96s)]
*  like a more like [[01:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=5339.6s)]
*  leniency by the democratic party to have the border be [[01:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=5342.14s)]
*  more fluid because then eventually those um [[01:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=5347.280000000001s)]
*  Statistically the people coming over are going to vote in their party and in their camp [[01:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=5351.740000000001s)]
*  Does that is that like a realistic possibility or no? [[01:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=5357.04s)]
*  You know, yes and no it so I think back, uh, it was 1994 bill clinton [[01:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=5360.8s)]
*  And that was the first time that there was a true focus on border security when we started to build fences [[01:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=5365.84s)]
*  Uh started to increase manpower and invest in technology and he was democrat. He was democrat. Yeah [[01:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=5370.88s)]
*  So anybody can do it anybody can do it. Absolutely. You know, you mentioned the the potential for a [[01:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=5375.5199999999995s)]
*  A support base i.e. Will these folks eventually vote democrat? [[01:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=5381.44s)]
*  It's possible a lot of them getting into uh unionized jobs that are tend to lean towards the democratic party [[01:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=5384.72s)]
*  so absolutely but uh [[01:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=5390.08s)]
*  Maybe that's too big of a jump. It well, I mean they can go either way [[01:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=5392.4s)]
*  But what i've seen a great example, um, my mother immigrated here legally decades ago [[01:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=5396.0s)]
*  And when she first came across [[01:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=5401.92s)]
*  Uh, and then legalized she's a u.s. Naturalized u.s. Citizen, you know her viewpoint on on illegal migration is she's absolutely wrong [[01:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=5403.6s)]
*  This is not the way to do it do it legally [[01:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=5410.16s)]
*  but her her political viewpoint went from [[01:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=5412.48s)]
*  probably more liberal towards conservative, you know and and [[01:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=5416.24s)]

*  you know, you just have to and you have to know why and [[01:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S035-0IQp1o&t=5540.88s)]
