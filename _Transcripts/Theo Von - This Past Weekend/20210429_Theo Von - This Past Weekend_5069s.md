*  And see if I could have an erection when the judge said that and just kind of laughed to myself [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpkMCxXeJ5s&t=11.16s)]
*  What's up you little skittle lickers I [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpkMCxXeJ5s&t=20.04s)]
*  Feel honored to be here with you today and happy day to you and [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpkMCxXeJ5s&t=24.64s)]
*  Am I got a lot to share and I'm sure you do [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpkMCxXeJ5s&t=30.12s)]
*  So we'll get into it. I just shaved [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpkMCxXeJ5s&t=35.68s)]
*  You know, I can't I'll be honest with you I can't shave with a shirt on I can't do it I [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpkMCxXeJ5s&t=42.36s)]
*  See people, you know and not in real time I don't watch men shave [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpkMCxXeJ5s&t=50.24s)]
*  And I'm not saying if there's nothing wrong if you do I don't [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpkMCxXeJ5s&t=56.28s)]
*  You know, I've only ever seen men shave on a commercial [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpkMCxXeJ5s&t=60.52s)]
*  But I realized about myself I can't shave with a [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpkMCxXeJ5s&t=65.96s)]
*  Shirt on I [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpkMCxXeJ5s&t=72.4s)]
*  Shave shirtless I [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpkMCxXeJ5s&t=74.96000000000001s)]
*  Shave shirtless and I think my dad shaved shirtless, you know my dad [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpkMCxXeJ5s&t=78.56s)]
*  When I met my dad he was a senior citizen and he's he was damn [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpkMCxXeJ5s&t=84.82s)]
*  That's as much citizen as you can get that's full citizen and [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpkMCxXeJ5s&t=90.16s)]

*  Baby tits really baby he had white skin [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpkMCxXeJ5s&t=104.72s)]
*  Because all the color I think had grown out of his skin [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpkMCxXeJ5s&t=109.72s)]
*  And he had a couple moles I think could have been nipples. I don't know [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpkMCxXeJ5s&t=113.64s)]
*  He could have had moles or nipples [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpkMCxXeJ5s&t=121.0s)]
*  But I remember he would shave shirtless and I would see him do it and and I thought you know what [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpkMCxXeJ5s&t=127.96s)]

*  Oh [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpkMCxXeJ5s&t=369.76000000000005s)]

*  We just had a good time man and you know, we talked about life and a little bit about [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpkMCxXeJ5s&t=451.56s)]
*  You know just what was going on in our lives and it was good to catch up and [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpkMCxXeJ5s&t=456.96s)]
*  And it was nice to be amongst friends. Um, oh, I'll tell you this. Um [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpkMCxXeJ5s&t=461.03999999999996s)]
*  you know, I [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpkMCxXeJ5s&t=466.4s)]
*  I've told this story before that [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpkMCxXeJ5s&t=468.23999999999995s)]
*  There was a man when I was growing up. There was a man named Don Big Don [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpkMCxXeJ5s&t=470.76s)]
*  Blankenstein and he was a pool man and [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpkMCxXeJ5s&t=475.12s)]
*  He'd come over and do the pool, you know treat the pool and clean the pool and [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpkMCxXeJ5s&t=478.24s)]
*  He'd get a little scoop and taste it [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpkMCxXeJ5s&t=483.76s)]
*  Make sure the kids were [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpkMCxXeJ5s&t=486.52s)]
*  You know pissing. Well, I guess I have no idea but [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpkMCxXeJ5s&t=488.76s)]
*  You know and when I used to work on this farm in the summer [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpkMCxXeJ5s&t=494.88s)]
*  Big Don would roll over there and he was a big fella [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpkMCxXeJ5s&t=498.52s)]
*  You know, he'd probably about 300 pounds and this is back when [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpkMCxXeJ5s&t=502.28s)]
*  This is back when three four hundred pounds would kill you now [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpkMCxXeJ5s&t=506.15999999999997s)]
*  People could go six seven hundred pounds and it's not really killing them out of the gate [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpkMCxXeJ5s&t=509.96s)]
*  But back then it was three you go three four hundred [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpkMCxXeJ5s&t=516.68s)]
*  You know that would kind of kill you but now with modern medicine people can go up to six hundred and they're alive for at least [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpkMCxXeJ5s&t=520.6s)]
*  a couple months or years like that [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpkMCxXeJ5s&t=526.4s)]
*  You know, they're not gonna see many WrestleMania's, but they'll see a couple [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpkMCxXeJ5s&t=529.16s)]
*  But uh, but Big Don came once [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpkMCxXeJ5s&t=533.92s)]
*  But uh, but Big Don came one one summer [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpkMCxXeJ5s&t=536.92s)]
*  I was back there working on this farm and the people I worked for had a pool and and [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpkMCxXeJ5s&t=539.64s)]
*  This man comes in the gate and he's real thin real lean fella [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpkMCxXeJ5s&t=543.9599999999999s)]
*  you know just like like a [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpkMCxXeJ5s&t=548.24s)]
*  Just look like a just a regular fella like a librarian man [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpkMCxXeJ5s&t=551.64s)]
*  See, you know what I'm talking about kind of a little bit of glass is maybe [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpkMCxXeJ5s&t=556.68s)]
*  You know had hands like workers hands though like you've been [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpkMCxXeJ5s&t=560.88s)]
*  Like you've been turning the pages of books but heavy books, you know real heavy paper I'm talking 300 pound test paper and [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpkMCxXeJ5s&t=564.8399999999999s)]
*  And I said who's this man, you know, I didn't know who this man was looking at the pool [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpkMCxXeJ5s&t=575.4399999999999s)]
*  I'd only seen Big Don [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpkMCxXeJ5s&t=579.16s)]
*  and [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpkMCxXeJ5s&t=581.7199999999999s)]
*  So my thought was that you know Big Don had passed on that weight [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpkMCxXeJ5s&t=582.8s)]
*  He his life had caved in under that weight and that weighted one, you know [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpkMCxXeJ5s&t=586.5799999999999s)]
*  But the but but the truth was it Big Don had lost the weight he got this stomach surgery [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpkMCxXeJ5s&t=594.8399999999999s)]
*  Where they staple your stomach directly the ass, you know, so whatever he comes wrong, I mean, it's I [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpkMCxXeJ5s&t=599.92s)]
*  Mean damn something's you eat them. They come out cleaner out the back, you know, your body will just wash it out [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpkMCxXeJ5s&t=604.9599999999999s)]
*  Whatever it is. You have four carrots and bitches is cleaned out [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpkMCxXeJ5s&t=609.3199999999999s)]
*  You know you eat a dirty squash and damn next thing, you know, you clean squash and [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpkMCxXeJ5s&t=614.4799999999999s)]
*  You know right out there in your underpants you got full freshly clean squashes and yonders [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpkMCxXeJ5s&t=620.52s)]

*  Like i'd never gotten to tell my dad how much I loved him [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpkMCxXeJ5s&t=1674.1799999999998s)]
*  You know, I never I had all this love for my father that I never got to put it anywhere [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpkMCxXeJ5s&t=1676.58s)]
*  And so we talked about that in the therapy. Um [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpkMCxXeJ5s&t=1681.2199999999998s)]
*  And what else just talking about some other things that have really been bugging me man, i've just felt really agitated easily [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpkMCxXeJ5s&t=1686.5s)]
*  Uh, I felt a lot angrier than usual man [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpkMCxXeJ5s&t=1693.78s)]
*  And i'm just interacting with people that I care about sometimes in an angry way and it makes me not feel good [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpkMCxXeJ5s&t=1698.18s)]
*  You know, it's like being in a [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpkMCxXeJ5s&t=1707.3s)]
*  It's almost like being in a mask, you know [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpkMCxXeJ5s&t=1712.34s)]
*  I've talked about it before about halloween when you're in like a scare mask, you know when you in a uh [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpkMCxXeJ5s&t=1714.02s)]
*  When you wolfing or whatever and you wolfed out with a headpiece with a mask on [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpkMCxXeJ5s&t=1719.94s)]
*  And you got that bad cat fucking uh [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpkMCxXeJ5s&t=1724.98s)]
*  You got that bad cat death sock on your head baby that you know that costume that mask and [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpkMCxXeJ5s&t=1730.02s)]
*  And sometimes when you're looking out of the mask you can see out of the mask you see [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpkMCxXeJ5s&t=1739.22s)]
*  Normally, it's your eyes looking but the people that see you if a child sees you he gets scared [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpkMCxXeJ5s&t=1743.5400000000002s)]
*  You know, he'll drop his damn baby ruths, bro and go hug his stepdaddy or whoever's with him [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpkMCxXeJ5s&t=1749.38s)]
*  you know [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpkMCxXeJ5s&t=1755.6200000000001s)]
*  and so um anyway [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpkMCxXeJ5s&t=1757.6200000000001s)]
*  So that's what it's like sometimes that's what it's felt like me for me. Sometimes in the past year is just kind of anger [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpkMCxXeJ5s&t=1760.74s)]
*  And I don't know what i'm angry about and i'm tired of not knowing [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpkMCxXeJ5s&t=1766.42s)]
*  And so i'm just trying to get i'm trying to figure it out [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpkMCxXeJ5s&t=1772.18s)]
*  and uh [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpkMCxXeJ5s&t=1776.9s)]
*  And so anyway, that's what's going on man [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpkMCxXeJ5s&t=1778.9s)]
*  and [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpkMCxXeJ5s&t=1781.78s)]
*  And I just noticed that I was like other people I noticed where I just i'm not interacting with people the same the way [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpkMCxXeJ5s&t=1783.3s)]
*  That I want to be [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpkMCxXeJ5s&t=1789.06s)]
*  In like a loving way [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpkMCxXeJ5s&t=1791.3s)]
*  um [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpkMCxXeJ5s&t=1793.7s)]
*  And i'm desperate for that [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpkMCxXeJ5s&t=1795.86s)]
*  You know, that's the part of life that I like to devour every day really [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpkMCxXeJ5s&t=1798.58s)]
*  You know and I felt like I was doing well with it for a while and then it's been tougher as of late, uh [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpkMCxXeJ5s&t=1804.58s)]
*  And I know there's a lot of stuff in the world that's making people angry and making people feel dilapidated in their spirit [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpkMCxXeJ5s&t=1810.26s)]
*  You know, there's a lot of like america that's been [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpkMCxXeJ5s&t=1819.7s)]
*  You know a lot of the fabric of our society I feel like is being unwoven [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpkMCxXeJ5s&t=1824.8999999999999s)]
*  By the media and by [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpkMCxXeJ5s&t=1834.1s)]
*  I don't know just people just want to dismantle a lot of tradition and a lot of like things that make you feel like you're [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpkMCxXeJ5s&t=1836.34s)]
*  part of a society [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpkMCxXeJ5s&t=1844.98s)]
*  You know everything is constantly challenged and [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpkMCxXeJ5s&t=1849.06s)]
*  In society was always what I felt like I was in you know, I felt like I was in this [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpkMCxXeJ5s&t=1854.34s)]
*  You know [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpkMCxXeJ5s&t=1859.62s)]
*  This calendar this world, you know, there's just certain little [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpkMCxXeJ5s&t=1861.2199999999998s)]
*  Systems of the day and of the week and of life that go on that make you feel like you're part of something [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpkMCxXeJ5s&t=1864.98s)]
*  And I think during the disease [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpkMCxXeJ5s&t=1874.26s)]
*  uh [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpkMCxXeJ5s&t=1876.74s)]
*  I think during the disease a lot of that stuff has gone is kind of [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpkMCxXeJ5s&t=1878.3400000000001s)]
*  You know, well a lot of it's been impossible to to spend time over [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpkMCxXeJ5s&t=1884.18s)]
*  And as well a lot of media has just attacked everything [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpkMCxXeJ5s&t=1889.3s)]
*  You know every every place you turn they're attacking some piece of something that meant that [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpkMCxXeJ5s&t=1892.66s)]
*  that even if it was a business or a [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpkMCxXeJ5s&t=1898.8200000000002s)]
*  Or anything that it meant something to you it felt like [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpkMCxXeJ5s&t=1902.8200000000002s)]
*  And that's okay because I know different things mean different things to different people but [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpkMCxXeJ5s&t=1906.8200000000002s)]
*  Uh, I think some of that anyways probably led to some of my angst and some of my uncomfort [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpkMCxXeJ5s&t=1912.42s)]
*  And i'm sure a lot of people can relate to that and how to not be angry [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpkMCxXeJ5s&t=1917.54s)]
*  And express my anger where to express it and how to express it as a as an adult because i'm an adult [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpkMCxXeJ5s&t=1921.06s)]
*  so [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpkMCxXeJ5s&t=1928.02s)]
*  Anyway, I didn't mean to get all heavy with that kind of stuff, but i'm just willing to try i'm healthy [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpkMCxXeJ5s&t=1929.54s)]
*  I'm willing to try things that are unique experiences. Um [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpkMCxXeJ5s&t=1934.58s)]
*  And so that's what i'm trying right now with this ketamine therapy and ketamine solution [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpkMCxXeJ5s&t=1939.3799999999999s)]
*  So one of my buddies I told him he's like so damn dude, you just been doing drugs all day [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpkMCxXeJ5s&t=1943.7s)]

*  But i'm hopeful about it man, i'm hopeful [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpkMCxXeJ5s&t=1957.6999999999998s)]
*  That it [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpkMCxXeJ5s&t=1961.06s)]

*  And sometimes I feel like i'm inside of myself looking out of the holes of [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpkMCxXeJ5s&t=1993.62s)]
*  Of a shape that I don't even recognize sometimes [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpkMCxXeJ5s&t=1997.86s)]
*  And i'm not being extra hard on myself, I know I am [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpkMCxXeJ5s&t=2001.06s)]

*  I don't think I I I don't think I don't think I don't think uh, I don't think a ton about it [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpkMCxXeJ5s&t=2777.08s)]
*  I do not think a ton about it, but i'm grateful that you sent it this past quarantine [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpkMCxXeJ5s&t=2783.96s)]
*  Actually now it's growing on me now that I said it [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpkMCxXeJ5s&t=2789.56s)]
*  This past quarantine [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpkMCxXeJ5s&t=2793.96s)]
*  You know, I think it would be a good episode or a good like um [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpkMCxXeJ5s&t=2797.08s)]
*  I think by the tour if it's a year later will people still be wanting to think about quarantine [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpkMCxXeJ5s&t=2801.88s)]
*  You know, that's what I wonder [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpkMCxXeJ5s&t=2807.32s)]
*  Uh, and then what if some people are, you know mask, you know real masked up I met a guy this morning [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpkMCxXeJ5s&t=2809.96s)]
*  Okay, i'm having breakfast somewhere at uh [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpkMCxXeJ5s&t=2817.0800000000004s)]
*  at a damn egg deal and [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpkMCxXeJ5s&t=2820.04s)]
*  I went I thought this fellow was this man I knew named ryan. I went up to him and said hey, are you ryan? [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpkMCxXeJ5s&t=2824.1200000000003s)]
*  He literally had to take off three masks. It was like watching someone [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpkMCxXeJ5s&t=2829.2400000000002s)]
*  Uh [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpkMCxXeJ5s&t=2835.1600000000003s)]
*  Be indoors and then like, you know, you go to a ticket window [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpkMCxXeJ5s&t=2837.48s)]
*  Sometimes you're trying to talk to them [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpkMCxXeJ5s&t=2839.96s)]
*  They can't hear you so they come out of the ticket when come out of the venue or whatever [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpkMCxXeJ5s&t=2840.92s)]
*  It was like that [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpkMCxXeJ5s&t=2844.68s)]
*  I had to wait for him to get this mask and then that one had a padlock. He had to get the key from his buddy [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpkMCxXeJ5s&t=2846.04s)]
*  You know, then he had to [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpkMCxXeJ5s&t=2852.44s)]
*  You know, then he had to push his fucking finger. He had a fingerprint man [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpkMCxXeJ5s&t=2854.44s)]
*  The third one to unlock and finally he's like no my name's shannon [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpkMCxXeJ5s&t=2857.56s)]
*  All right. All right [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpkMCxXeJ5s&t=2861.3999999999996s)]
*  All right [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpkMCxXeJ5s&t=2863.48s)]
*  And I actually as soon as I noticed he had three masks. I didn't even want to know him anymore [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpkMCxXeJ5s&t=2865.32s)]
*  Even if it was the guy I knew [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpkMCxXeJ5s&t=2869.32s)]
*  If it would have been ryan I would have said, you know what ryan [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpkMCxXeJ5s&t=2872.76s)]
*  I think we're good [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpkMCxXeJ5s&t=2876.92s)]
*  I think we're good. Um [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpkMCxXeJ5s&t=2879.48s)]
*  Thank you for all the suggestions, you know, and uh [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpkMCxXeJ5s&t=2881.96s)]
*  And and I appreciate them and who knows? [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpkMCxXeJ5s&t=2885.0800000000004s)]
*  One of those could be it and if I if I do i'll reach out and discuss it with you before I just take your name [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpkMCxXeJ5s&t=2887.6400000000003s)]
*  um [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpkMCxXeJ5s&t=2892.04s)]
*  We got a couple videos that came in right here. Let's see what let's see what uh, some of this was and some decent [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpkMCxXeJ5s&t=2893.96s)]
*  material visual material [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpkMCxXeJ5s&t=2899.08s)]
*  Oh, and this is a car jumping the daytona beach bridge. Yeah [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpkMCxXeJ5s&t=2902.44s)]
*  Let's go [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpkMCxXeJ5s&t=2911.0s)]
*  Let's go [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpkMCxXeJ5s&t=2913.32s)]
*  If you can't see and you can't see it because this is verbally for some of you they have basically [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpkMCxXeJ5s&t=2915.7200000000003s)]
*  They have a bridge that closes [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpkMCxXeJ5s&t=2920.92s)]
*  One of those closing bridges and [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpkMCxXeJ5s&t=2927.56s)]
*  Sometimes by like a river [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpkMCxXeJ5s&t=2930.92s)]
*  You know, I grew up for a while over there on a chafunctah river [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpkMCxXeJ5s&t=2934.04s)]
*  down there in st. Tammany, paris, louisiana and [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpkMCxXeJ5s&t=2938.2s)]
*  They said that it got its name because the chafunctah indians [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpkMCxXeJ5s&t=2942.44s)]
*  named it [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpkMCxXeJ5s&t=2947.7999999999997s)]
*  And they got their name because one of them had taken a large rock [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpkMCxXeJ5s&t=2949.7999999999997s)]
*  And thrown it into some water [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpkMCxXeJ5s&t=2954.12s)]
*  river [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpkMCxXeJ5s&t=2956.68s)]
*  Multifold water [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpkMCxXeJ5s&t=2958.74s)]
*  And that's the sound it made when it went in chafunctah [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpkMCxXeJ5s&t=2961.72s)]
*  And I always thought man that how fascinating is that [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpkMCxXeJ5s&t=2966.8399999999997s)]
*  How much closer [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpkMCxXeJ5s&t=2971.56s)]
*  To the earth can you be? [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpkMCxXeJ5s&t=2973.9599999999996s)]
*  Than to be the octave or the the the audio remnant [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpkMCxXeJ5s&t=2976.92s)]
*  Of the sound of a rock going into water. I mean damn [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpkMCxXeJ5s&t=2982.36s)]
*  You want mother nature's tit, baby? [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpkMCxXeJ5s&t=2986.76s)]
*  You doing full milk [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpkMCxXeJ5s&t=2989.96s)]
*  And so I always thought that was fascinating that the rock could make chafunctah when they threw it in the water and said [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpkMCxXeJ5s&t=2994.44s)]
*  that's what they named their tribe, but [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpkMCxXeJ5s&t=2999.64s)]
*  anyway, they had one of these bridges where [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpkMCxXeJ5s&t=3002.44s)]
*  Rich people it would either every half hour the bridge would open for boats to go through [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpkMCxXeJ5s&t=3005.0s)]
*  On weekends and every hour on weekdays [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpkMCxXeJ5s&t=3010.12s)]
*  So if you were driving you had to stop and wait it was a couple minutes [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpkMCxXeJ5s&t=3013.0s)]
*  And then there was rumor that rich people could get through whenever they wanted [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpkMCxXeJ5s&t=3016.76s)]
*  So I always hated that shit [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpkMCxXeJ5s&t=3021.0s)]
*  but [[00:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpkMCxXeJ5s&t=3023.7200000000003s)]
*  God always this person in the video speeds through the little candy cane thing that tells you to stop [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpkMCxXeJ5s&t=3025.64s)]
*  You know the little red and white stick or whatever the stop stick [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpkMCxXeJ5s&t=3031.32s)]
*  This dude blasts right through it [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpkMCxXeJ5s&t=3034.6800000000003s)]
*  And then the ramp is going up [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpkMCxXeJ5s&t=3037.2400000000002s)]
*  So it's already the road is separated the ramps are going up on both sides the bridges [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpkMCxXeJ5s&t=3039.2400000000002s)]
*  And this guy jumps the first one and lands on the second one [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpkMCxXeJ5s&t=3043.48s)]
*  I mean, it's not a far jump [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpkMCxXeJ5s&t=3047.1600000000003s)]
*  but [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpkMCxXeJ5s&t=3049.7200000000003s)]
*  I'll be damn if it isn't damn amazing and he makes it. I mean, it's just starting to separate [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpkMCxXeJ5s&t=3051.1600000000003s)]
*  Just starting to separate [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpkMCxXeJ5s&t=3056.84s)]
*  He just right through [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpkMCxXeJ5s&t=3059.7200000000003s)]
*  Bam he made air he had about a almost a full second of air [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpkMCxXeJ5s&t=3062.6000000000004s)]
*  so [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpkMCxXeJ5s&t=3067.08s)]
*  Amen to that guy [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpkMCxXeJ5s&t=3068.36s)]
*  And maybe that's where we're heading where people start to do things themselves more [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpkMCxXeJ5s&t=3070.92s)]
*  You know what? I'm late for work. Oh, well [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpkMCxXeJ5s&t=3074.92s)]
*  You know, that's one thing I worry about the the the fabric of our society being eroded [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpkMCxXeJ5s&t=3078.6800000000003s)]
*  Sometimes and and i'm not saying i'm right with some of my speculations. I'm just [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpkMCxXeJ5s&t=3085.2400000000002s)]
*  I don't know over this whole thing. It started to feel like it doesn't matter what month it is [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpkMCxXeJ5s&t=3092.44s)]
*  It doesn't matter what the holidays are. It's all [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpkMCxXeJ5s&t=3096.36s)]
*  I don't know [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpkMCxXeJ5s&t=3100.0400000000004s)]
*  Some of that's just felt kind of defeating and and I know there's ways to battle against that [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpkMCxXeJ5s&t=3103.0s)]
*  I'm not saying that i'm defeated or that we should feel defeated but [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpkMCxXeJ5s&t=3107.0800000000004s)]
*  Some of those feelings have been adding I think to just to me not feeling good, but um anyway, uh [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpkMCxXeJ5s&t=3111.32s)]
*  But maybe that's what relief people just creating new pathways, baby [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpkMCxXeJ5s&t=3120.6s)]
*  Creating new pathways saying look [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpkMCxXeJ5s&t=3126.6s)]
*  This is how we do it now if you want to make the jump [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpkMCxXeJ5s&t=3129.16s)]
*  If you want to be that bad boy that daytona beach bridge buster then get out there [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpkMCxXeJ5s&t=3132.68s)]
*  Because this dude whoo, it's a wild it's a wild trip [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpkMCxXeJ5s&t=3138.84s)]
*  And one thing that's interesting too about the ketamine therapy. They say it builds new pathways in your brain [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpkMCxXeJ5s&t=3143.2400000000002s)]
*  to help battle depression so [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpkMCxXeJ5s&t=3149.0s)]
*  Sometimes with depression you have a lot of old thought processes, you know, your thoughts will travel the same roads [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpkMCxXeJ5s&t=3151.7200000000003s)]
*  They get scared to go on new roads. You get stuck on these old roads and they got potholes and they got [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpkMCxXeJ5s&t=3158.76s)]
*  You know people probably fucking on the side and doing cocaine, you know, not cocaine but probably selling strawberries [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpkMCxXeJ5s&t=3163.8s)]
*  And you're like damn i'm not going over there again, bro. I'm gonna be full of fruit and fucked, you know, so I ain't doing it [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpkMCxXeJ5s&t=3169.88s)]
*  And so but your thoughts keep going along those same roads [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpkMCxXeJ5s&t=3177.4s)]
*  Well part of this therapy is supposed to make new bridges in your brain synapses [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpkMCxXeJ5s&t=3181.1600000000003s)]
*  So so it's interesting to see this bridge because that's not what I feel like maybe i'm hopeful for [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpkMCxXeJ5s&t=3186.04s)]
*  I'm hopeful some of my thoughts say, you know what i'm gonna try something new this time. I'm gonna try a new pattern [[00:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpkMCxXeJ5s&t=3190.36s)]
*  Because I would love to be all off of antidepressants, you know, it's crazy to me that every day I have to take a pill [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpkMCxXeJ5s&t=3198.28s)]
*  I have to take a pill every day [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpkMCxXeJ5s&t=3206.6800000000003s)]
*  It's been 20 years now [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpkMCxXeJ5s&t=3209.48s)]
*  I have to take a pill. Um, what if you broke your arm? [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpkMCxXeJ5s&t=3212.1200000000003s)]
*  You know, I've seen people do that [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpkMCxXeJ5s&t=3216.04s)]
*  You broke your arm [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpkMCxXeJ5s&t=3218.04s)]
*  You know, i've said this before and if you if you broke your arm if you if your arm didn't [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpkMCxXeJ5s&t=3219.8s)]
*  You know if your arm said, oh fuck it. Let's do another elbow [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpkMCxXeJ5s&t=3224.2799999999997s)]
*  You wouldn't wear a cast for 20 years [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpkMCxXeJ5s&t=3229.24s)]
*  So the fact that 20 years ago I was feeling really bummed out about a relationship or something [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpkMCxXeJ5s&t=3234.68s)]
*  And I went to a therapist and i'm still on the medicine they gave me [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpkMCxXeJ5s&t=3240.2799999999997s)]
*  That shit's trying man I should [[00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpkMCxXeJ5s&t=3243.32s)]
*  And it's hard to get off man i'll quit i'll take I won't take it for two or three days and I get scared [[00:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpkMCxXeJ5s&t=3247.6400000000003s)]
*  You know, i'd love to be free of that though and i'm sure a lot of people would [[00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpkMCxXeJ5s&t=3257.4s)]
*  Knowing that every day I have this one little thing. I can't just go out the door [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpkMCxXeJ5s&t=3263.48s)]
*  I gotta go to whatever drawer wherever my little medication is and do my little [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpkMCxXeJ5s&t=3266.76s)]
*  Deal and deal up [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpkMCxXeJ5s&t=3270.52s)]
*  And in college i'll be honest I used to snort them bro I cracked them bitches up and snort them dog [[00:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpkMCxXeJ5s&t=3274.12s)]
*  I'd be rolling around high, you know [[00:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpkMCxXeJ5s&t=3279.2400000000002s)]

*  Many stars in that state man, you're one of them tyler and thank you for the call [[01:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpkMCxXeJ5s&t=3976.4s)]
*  Uh, yeah, you know, I do have a suggestion when it comes to real estate [[01:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpkMCxXeJ5s&t=3981.04s)]
*  You know, I find that some on some deals [[01:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpkMCxXeJ5s&t=3985.92s)]
*  The [[01:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpkMCxXeJ5s&t=3989.52s)]
*  Agents make too much money. I feel like and if you're a real estate agent, you're not going to like hearing this [[01:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpkMCxXeJ5s&t=3991.6s)]
*  but [[01:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpkMCxXeJ5s&t=3997.6s)]
*  You know if it only takes you a day to find the place [[01:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpkMCxXeJ5s&t=3999.4399999999996s)]
*  And there may you know, it's and it's six percent [[01:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpkMCxXeJ5s&t=4003.2799999999997s)]
*  Three to each agent if you're using an agent [[01:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpkMCxXeJ5s&t=4008.08s)]
*  Then one suggestion if you think it's a hot market you're not it's going to be easy for you to find [[01:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpkMCxXeJ5s&t=4013.2s)]
*  You could offer to the agent. Hey [[01:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpkMCxXeJ5s&t=4018.96s)]
*  I'm only willing to pay two percent [[01:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpkMCxXeJ5s&t=4021.44s)]
*  And some agents will say okay, that's okay [[01:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpkMCxXeJ5s&t=4026.1600000000003s)]
*  And if they say no, I only work on three percent and then you can decide and do three percent if you want [[01:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpkMCxXeJ5s&t=4029.76s)]
*  But if you only do two percent when you're buying [[01:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpkMCxXeJ5s&t=4035.76s)]
*  Then that one percent can go back to your side of the balance sheet [[01:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpkMCxXeJ5s&t=4039.6s)]
*  So you could save a little bit of money right there [[01:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpkMCxXeJ5s&t=4043.44s)]
*  You know that's a one way to do it [[01:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpkMCxXeJ5s&t=4045.68s)]
*  And it's a more ethical way to do it because otherwise you have to say to the agent hey [[01:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpkMCxXeJ5s&t=4049.92s)]
*  You know, can we do three percent? But you kick me back one percent and that's illegal [[01:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpkMCxXeJ5s&t=4054.48s)]
*  That's illegality [[01:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpkMCxXeJ5s&t=4060.08s)]
*  So that's one thing. I think if you're looking for a spot that two percent [[01:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpkMCxXeJ5s&t=4062.32s)]
*  All for the agent. Hey two percent, you know, because if you're going to buy a place it's 300 grand [[01:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpkMCxXeJ5s&t=4068.0s)]
*  You know that's six six six that's [[01:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpkMCxXeJ5s&t=4072.4s)]
*  Six eighteen thousand dollars six six six and they're going to split that each up nine and nine the agents [[01:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpkMCxXeJ5s&t=4078.88s)]
*  So you get that cut? [[01:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpkMCxXeJ5s&t=4085.2s)]
*  So you get in there cop that then you'll get three back on your side because you're getting one percent back on your side [[01:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpkMCxXeJ5s&t=4087.68s)]
*  So that's it. I would just like to pay a two percent agent fee instead of three percent [[01:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpkMCxXeJ5s&t=4093.84s)]
*  I would just like to pay a two percent agent fee instead of three percent [[01:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpkMCxXeJ5s&t=4097.28s)]
*  and I think sometimes if it's a [[01:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpkMCxXeJ5s&t=4101.12s)]
*  You'll find an agent that was willing to do it [[01:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpkMCxXeJ5s&t=4103.759999999999s)]
*  You know [[01:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpkMCxXeJ5s&t=4106.96s)]
*  um [[01:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpkMCxXeJ5s&t=4108.0s)]
*  And you can do it respectfully too. It's just hey, this is what I can afford right now [[01:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpkMCxXeJ5s&t=4109.36s)]
*  This is what i'm willing to do and that's just my advice [[01:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpkMCxXeJ5s&t=4113.92s)]
*  Suggestion and it's only because you asked man and I could be wrong also [[01:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpkMCxXeJ5s&t=4117.5s)]
*  But thank you tyler for sending that in [[01:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpkMCxXeJ5s&t=4122.24s)]
*  You know, we get a lot of suggestions on here for uh for single moms that are submitted and I want to thank you guys [[01:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpkMCxXeJ5s&t=4124.24s)]

*  The little things we do in other ways in our lives to honor past experiences that we've had [[01:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpkMCxXeJ5s&t=4224.88s)]
*  You know, that's really one of the beauties of human connection is [[01:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpkMCxXeJ5s&t=4230.56s)]
*  I could have an experience that happened 10 years ago [[01:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpkMCxXeJ5s&t=4234.24s)]
*  That was maybe that went well or didn't go well or whatever [[01:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpkMCxXeJ5s&t=4237.84s)]
*  But I can solve that energy from that experience or I can share that energy from that experience [[01:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpkMCxXeJ5s&t=4242.0s)]
*  The next time some similar environment shows up in my life [[01:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpkMCxXeJ5s&t=4248.64s)]
*  I can do it different. I can do it new [[01:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpkMCxXeJ5s&t=4253.2s)]

*  And it's just like a fun thing. I was raised by a single mom and so he thought that he would uh, [[01:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpkMCxXeJ5s&t=4313.84s)]
*  He would recommend somebody that he admires who's a single mom and so he recommended you [[01:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpkMCxXeJ5s&t=4318.8s)]
*  Oh, that was so sweet. Yeah, it is pretty nice of him. What's jason like him? You can be honest [[01:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpkMCxXeJ5s&t=4325.5199999999995s)]
