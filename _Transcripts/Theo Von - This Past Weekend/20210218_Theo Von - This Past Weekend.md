*  Yeah, you're a different person because [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=94.44s)]
*  You're used to doing everything that you want at the whim when you want to do it [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=97.28s)]
*  You're living on your time with your vibe [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=102.2s)]

*  Yeah who expect things from you, but you are so used to on the road [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=112.10000000000001s)]
*  Everything you want to do when you want to do it is when it happens [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=117.5s)]
*  Yeah, I think you know be yeah, I think being on the road honest head is for us is probably the most organized [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=120.78s)]
*  time of my life [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=125.94s)]
*  Like I am on or I'm almost grateful [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=127.66s)]
*  Sometimes that there's the road because it's like then I know a place I have to be I have some a little bit more [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=130.66s)]
*  Responsibility, you know, there's no doubt this quarantine [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=138.1s)]
*  Has done a couple things for me one it has highlighted [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=142.06s)]
*  That I'm not as mentally [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=147.14000000000001s)]

*  Because I've had more time with my own brain. Do you know what I mean? [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=155.54s)]
*  It hasn't been like the road had me on a schedule [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=159.42000000000002s)]
*  Oh, yeah, the road get it offers a lot of get-out-of-jail-free cards. Yeah. Oh shit's bad at the house. Yeah [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=162.54s)]

*  It's true. Yeah, but also like with more time to [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=179.94s)]
*  Be introspective. I've realized oh some of this things [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=185.66s)]
*  Because of my schedule has been so hectic some of my some of my shortcomings. I've really covered up really with yeah, man [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=190.34s)]
*  Yeah [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=197.74s)]
*  One thing that this year has shown me like cuz I will tell you I'm at the same time mentally healthier than I've ever been [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=198.66s)]
*  But also on healthier because I've really sat with myself. Mmm, so I've peeled back more layers [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=204.9s)]
*  Which feels healthy, but then I'm peeling shit back and being like, oh you're fucked up. This onion's dirty. Yeah. Yeah [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=211.70000000000002s)]
*  This onion needs to be washed [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=217.58s)]
*  Like this layer this onion has tears in it [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=220.34s)]
*  It looks like people been crying on this onion [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=223.82s)]
*  Yeah, so but it's been it's been interesting man, you know, it's been interesting [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=227.26s)]
*  The one thing I've discovered the most dude is that a lot of times [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=232.73999999999998s)]
*  the happier I [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=237.34s)]
*  appear [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=239.7s)]
*  It's a it's me covering up for something. Oh [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=240.74s)]
*  Cuz I'm a super happy optimistic dude [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=245.18s)]
*  Yeah [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=247.38s)]
*  You always seem like the happiest dude and so what I've looked at is sometimes when I'm really doubting myself or really [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=247.66s)]
*  Struggling with something personally. I'm extra happy now. I am an optimistic dude and by nature [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=256.06s)]
*  I like lifting people up like I think the more successful all of us are the better it is for everybody like all that shit [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=261.42s)]
*  but there's sometimes where I [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=269.14s)]
*  put on that face when inside I'm like [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=271.22s)]
*  The more I hate myself the happier I am to other people really it's what I've just found over quarantine dude, it's been but [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=274.58s)]
*  Manas really that's interesting man. I'm trying to think about that as you say it like I wonder if I [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=282.34s)]
*  The more I hate myself the happier I am to other people [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=289.09999999999997s)]
*  It's my defense mechanism, you know, I you know under see yeah, I can I can't know I didn't know that but you always seem [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=292.9s)]
*  Like, you know, you're always usually like really affable and you know friendly guy [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=300.06s)]
*  What's your but like what's your like when you are in a bad spot so some people disappear they were they remove themselves [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=306.96s)]
*  From other people right? That's their defense. Like I have a family member that like when they disappear. I'm like other [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=314.46s)]
*  Some bad stuff. Yeah, do you know? [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=321.46s)]
*  But it's the opposite for me. I want to show you how well I am. So I'm [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=324.34000000000003s)]
*  I'm in front of your face showing you how good I know. You know what I mean? Yeah [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=329.02s)]

*  I feel like I'll probably be I'll get more down in the dumps probably [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=338.38s)]
*  You know or I'll get I definitely get angry like if things aren't going good. I'll get uh [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=342.42s)]
*  I've found recently in this past year. Definitely anger is something that I've had to deal with more than ever [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=348.3s)]
*  Do you do you find yourself? [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=352.74s)]

*  With all of his food that he was delivering and then he just picks up the cup and throws it at the house just for [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=393.85999999999996s)]
*  It's already empty but he's just he wants one last one last hurrah. Yeah, he wants to get it in there right there [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=402.29999999999995s)]

*  Okay, I'm gonna she wants me to fix this shit. He's he's doing his best to keep it under control right now [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=430.82s)]
*  Hey [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=442.09999999999997s)]
*  He's God baby, let me tell you my favorite part about that. Yeah, I like seeing angry dude lift shit above his head before he breaks it [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=446.65999999999997s)]
*  That that is an angry movement right there with you such a caveman move [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=457.34s)]
*  Yeah, and and you know what like he really wanted to I'm sure when he looks back at this video [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=461.58s)]
*  He's not gonna like the way he looked. I'm sure he wanted to look smoother [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=466.82s)]
*  When he was wrecking it or when he was throwing it off the you know, none of it looked great, you know [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=470.1s)]
*  No, it'll make him probably got bet [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=475.06s)]
*  I would I wonder where that guy is now like did he get in a crossfit? [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=476.58s)]
*  Did he get into yoga? [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=479.42s)]
*  Did he get into did he start a screen nowadays? You could take a viral video and literally start a screen door throwing [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=480.74s)]
*  Competition. Yeah, or maybe throw the screen. Maybe that child is so embarrassed of his father [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=488.82s)]
*  He's like I'm gonna work out for the rest of my life [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=493.26s)]
*  Maybe maybe maybe that kid looks at that video a couple times and like look at this [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=495.5s)]
*  He couldn't even smush a screen door his home or [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=500.73999999999995s)]
*  But you know what that screen door [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=505.85999999999996s)]
*  the only thing more frustrating to me besides not being able to put it up is you know the [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=508.85999999999996s)]
*  When you had the headphones that had the wire [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=513.74s)]
*  Mm-hmm, and you would knock the you would knock it and pull the earbuds out of your ear [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=516.26s)]
*  Nothing made me want to strangle another human or especially at the gym [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=521.42s)]
*  Yeah, when you're working out and you just knock it and both of them fall out of your ears. You're like [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=525.3s)]
*  Because at the gym, I don't like I don't know about you. I need to find [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=530.9399999999999s)]

*  But I guess I feel like when I'm in there [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=590.3s)]
*  I try to look at the chicks but a lot of chicks now that everybody wears headphones now, so you can't talk to any chicks [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=593.78s)]
*  Yeah [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=599.86s)]
*  So then also if you get recognized always by dudes [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=601.26s)]
*  So it's like you end up having to talk to a bunch of dudes the whole time, you know, which is great [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=604.0600000000001s)]
*  Yeah, but it's not chicks. No, no, no and [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=608.58s)]
*  You know like I don't want I hate it when people stand around and they'll watch you do your set [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=612.1s)]
*  Waiting to talk to you. You're like, oh man. I'm having a hard time working out with you. Just staring at me, bro [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=620.02s)]
*  You know what I mean? Like yeah, can maybe we can meet up [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=624.22s)]
*  The worst is the is the I didn't want to bother you like they walk you follow you in the locker room [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=627.22s)]
*  I didn't want to bother you doing your workout. So you thought Dick in hand was a better. Yeah, this is a good time [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=631.82s)]
*  This is a better time to jump in [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=637.38s)]
*  Next to me at a restaurant the other day and sat right and he taught he tried nine different ways to talk to me man [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=639.58s)]
*  And finally I said, hey man, I'm just trying to watch some bass [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=644.78s)]
*  I'm just trying to watch a basketball and chat with my friend. I had to just [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=647.26s)]
*  It was just too much man. It was just I poured out his life story [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=650.74s)]
*  Yeah, really sad and like I get it sometimes but this dude was also pretty wasted I think so that makes it tougher [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=655.3s)]
*  I I am NOT one of those dudes that like I think you talking to me [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=661.02s)]
*  Comes with the job. I [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=666.18s)]
*  Think like if you see me out, especially us it's different man. I think if you're Tom Cruise, right Tom Cruise on a big screen [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=668.38s)]
*  So the difference between seeing Tom Cruise, he's a movie star you leave your house to go into a dark room [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=675.2199999999999s)]
*  So if you see Tom Cruise at the airport, you're like, there's Tom Cruise, but you're not gonna go up and talk to him [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=680.42s)]
*  Because he doesn't play Tom Cruise. He plays all those different roles your Theo Vaughn [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=684.8199999999999s)]
*  Yeah, you talk about your personal shit. So they feel like they know like you're oh, right [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=688.64s)]
*  Do you know what I mean? They have an attachment to you that they don't have to Tom Cruise, right? [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=694.38s)]
*  So I get it when people come up at the bar come up because they already feel like oh, I know that dude [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=698.12s)]
*  Oh, yeah, you know what I mean? I totally get it. Yeah podcasts [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=703.1999999999999s)]
*  Podcasts listeners and podcasters and everybody there's definitely more of like a family sense kind of I think so relation sense [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=706.26s)]
*  The thing is this guy that I ran into I don't think he knew me [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=712.58s)]
*  I think he was just a drunk guy you could literally see that he went from person to person and people just kept sending him away [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=716.38s)]
*  He's like everybody I know died in the car accident [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=723.26s)]
*  And you were like, how'd you get out like I bet they just told you that [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=728.42s)]
*  Happily in Utah you tried their numbers because I think they still work. Yeah, I had a dude tell me once [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=734.74s)]

*  Had a couple missing teeth. Mm-hmm [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=741.38s)]
*  And he goes I lost my teeth cuz my daddy ran over me with a tractor when I was six and I was like what? [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=743.5s)]

*  Because that sounds realistic [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=2052.5s)]
*  Entry to us market after years of conflicts a relationship between us and vietnam was eventually brightened up [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=2054.66s)]

*  To fly them over from a different country. That's crazy. So then when you think about it must be so then when you think about that [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=2087.8599999999997s)]
*  With the shipping costs, that's what i'm saying to keep it cold. You have to keep it cold or keep it in water [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=2095.54s)]

*  It was almost unbearable [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=2637.96s)]
*  but when they would bomb [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=2640.12s)]
*  And ditch their jokes and just become their selves on stage. Yeah, they would light up [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=2642.52s)]
*  They would light up the room and you I watched them gradually progress into realizing. Oh, I just got to be myself on stage [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=2648.84s)]
*  Yeah, especially those two guys. Do you know what I mean? Like though? Oh, yeah their personalities [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=2655.7999999999997s)]

*  Right. That's the thing that you'd see people who were sitting there like this guy's horrible [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=2669.24s)]
*  Yeah, and it's like no you don't if you knew [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=2672.92s)]

*  Yeah, um, if you knew that his gpa is something he really talks about what he how he did in school at asu [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=2683.08s)]
*  Yeah, it it makes sense [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=2690.3599999999997s)]

*  If you knew that he just wandered around like that, then you weren't shocked when he got on stage [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=2695.0s)]
*  Just keep looking see if you find anything. I mean if you you know little things [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=2700.3599999999997s)]
*  The oh like watching him stretch on stage like kick his leg up. Yeah [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=2704.52s)]
*  Because he was so authentic [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=2708.68s)]
*  To just who he was [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=2711.08s)]
*  He got more laughs [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=2713.08s)]
*  Off of jokes with more with that didn't have punch lines than anybody i've ever known in my life [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=2715.64s)]
*  I mean it was amazing to watch [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=2720.12s)]
*  Yeah, he had his own way of [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=2722.7599999999998s)]
*  You know [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=2726.2s)]
*  He had his uh, yeah, he just did his own thing [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=2727.48s)]
*  But he yes he became just [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=2729.48s)]
*  They wanted to love him and I think that's a lot of audiences [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=2731.64s)]
*  It's like they want to get to know this person that they're going to see. Yeah, you know [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=2735.16s)]
*  and a lot of uh of comedians [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=2740.2s)]
*  A lot of us we think is just about the joke and it's not about [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=2743.3199999999997s)]
*  About ourselves, you know, but the crazy part is it's hard to get comfortable enough on stage to get back to just being yourself [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=2746.84s)]
*  It's like this big huge circle. It's like [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=2755.32s)]
*  In the beginning you'd be comfortable by your friends [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=2758.6000000000004s)]
*  Y'all are comfortable having fun at the lunch table. You know people spitting out milk people's having fun. It's fun [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=2761.8s)]
*  You know, it's fun [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=2767.5600000000004s)]
*  And there that's where you get a little idea in your head man [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=2768.92s)]
*  Maybe i'm funny, you know [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=2771.2400000000002s)]
*  And then you take it on this big circle and there's no pressure at the lunch table. It's fun [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=2772.6s)]
*  You it's all good. You're gonna leave they're gonna leave you're all going to class whatever [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=2777.8s)]
*  And I feel like eventually the goal is to get back to that spot on stage. Um [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=2781.8s)]
*  I agree with you 100 percent [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=2786.84s)]
*  I think man [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=2788.7599999999998s)]
*  the trick for a lot of us [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=2790.6s)]
*  Is so when you first start out there are very few people who are confident enough to be themselves [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=2793.4s)]
*  You're agreed you're some sort of heightened reality of yourself, yeah, right and that heightened reality changes [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=2799.88s)]
*  either in how you talk [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=2806.92s)]
*  And how you like when I was a younger comic? [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=2809.16s)]
*  Heightened reality me was louder [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=2813.2400000000002s)]
*  Moved around a lot more. Do you know what I mean? Oh, yeah, and so [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=2816.28s)]
*  But but the trick is to [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=2820.28s)]
*  Hopefully your audience allows you to grow and change [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=2822.84s)]
*  And morph into the real you do you know what I mean? [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=2827.7999999999997s)]
*  Hopefully your audience realizes that as an artist you're growing also and you're changing and I can't be the exact dude [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=2831.3199999999997s)]
*  I was when I was 10 years in because i'm 15 years in now and i'm a different person [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=2838.04s)]
*  You know what I mean? And it gets scary as an artist too because you get stuck thinking. Okay [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=2843.0s)]
*  Well, is that just the like is that the only me is that the best me like how will I? [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=2847.08s)]
*  I [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=2852.28s)]
*  Can I shake that is it okay to grow into myself or is the audience still going to support me? [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=2853.7200000000003s)]
*  I think also like if you get an audience too early [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=2858.6800000000003s)]
*  It could be bad if you haven't really become whoever you're going to be because then yeah [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=2861.8s)]
*  They're getting this like version of you that's not really [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=2866.0400000000004s)]
*  Refined or it's not really a hundred percent as authentic as you could get [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=2869.46s)]
*  Here's a question that came in right here from someone and this could be brennan shaw [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=2873.32s)]

*  All right. I got a couple questions. First of all, did he need to be shirtless for the question or [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=2889.48s)]
*  I think it makes him feel [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=2895.0s)]
*  Look, I can't I can't make it through a a good television program [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=2897.08s)]
*  I can't make through an episode of the wire without taking my shirt off. Well, yeah, but that's personal [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=2900.52s)]

*  maybe every now and then there's a little bit of like a [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=3610.86s)]
*  Undercurrent or something of like, okay, maybe I should move this along or i'm a little rusty [[01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=3615.1s)]
*  But there's it gets to the point where you're the ocean. You're the force [[01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=3620.46s)]
*  And I think that's that's just what I noticed over time and I don't even know when it happened really I think [[01:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=3625.02s)]
*  I think [[01:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=3631.3399999999997s)]
*  You know, maybe like there was one point where I got upset with hollywood and [[01:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=3633.3399999999997s)]
*  I just felt well, I didn't I don't know if I got upset [[01:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=3638.54s)]
*  I've always kind of had a chip on my shoulder about hollywood just because I feel like they don't put a lot of people [[01:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=3640.7799999999997s)]
*  Like regular people up in hollywood that much more. I know and it's a lot of nepotism now [[01:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=3645.74s)]
*  It's like this person's kid now. It's just and the kid has no culture. You know, it's just there's no [[01:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=3651.98s)]
*  so I think um [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=3658.2999999999997s)]
*  I'm always trying to like sound like a perfect guy who would be somewhere, you know [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=3660.22s)]
*  Oh, i'm in the yard next door, you know, like just this [[01:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=3663.42s)]
*  thing that would be okay for hollywood and then at one point I just said dude i'm just gonna talk about [[01:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=3666.38s)]
*  What I like to what I know i'm gonna talk about just the shit that was around me growing up and just [[01:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=3673.18s)]
*  The weird people and the shit that happened and people [[01:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=3678.38s)]
*  you know, they busted a man trying to be a ghost in our town and just shit like that, you know, just like stories from [[01:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=3681.5s)]
*  home and [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=3686.2999999999997s)]
*  Um, do you feel like your comfort level? [[01:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=3687.58s)]
*  When do you feel like when you started sitting down? [[01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=3692.06s)]
*  Was also around the same time you got more comfortable [[01:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=3694.94s)]
*  Uh, no, I don't think so. I think I started sitting down just because um [[01:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=3697.8199999999997s)]
*  I have one story that takes like about 12 minutes and it's kind of better from a stool [[01:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=3702.7s)]
*  Yeah, and so I think that's kind of led to me sitting down [[01:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=3706.06s)]
*  I think in the future i'll probably have to get back on my feet to really start to feel everything again [[01:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=3709.02s)]
*  You know [[01:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=3713.02s)]
*  Getting older it gets more comfortable sometimes sitting down too [[01:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=3713.98s)]
*  I you know, what was for me like [[01:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=3716.54s)]
*  I [[01:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=3719.42s)]
*  It's about nuance like it is about the performance, you know [[01:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=3720.54s)]
*  And as i've gotten older, i've really given myself more leeway to be experimental on stage [[01:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=3724.3s)]
*  And um, so I did one whole tour from a stool [[01:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=3731.02s)]
*  I did then I did the next year just standing in front of the mic. Wow, and then I did one of just moving [[01:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=3733.98s)]
*  And so I was like it's so interesting now. I can tell what part of the story needs me to be still [[01:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=3740.2200000000003s)]
*  And what part of the story needs the motion because it really [[01:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=3745.34s)]
*  adds to the punch, you know what I mean, but if you're always moving or you're always still [[01:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=3748.86s)]
*  Like I really feels like you can figure out [[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=3754.62s)]
*  in your act what parts [[01:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=3758.14s)]
*  Work better like that. You know what I mean? [[01:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=3760.7s)]
*  And to me that those nuanced parts is what happens when you get a little older and you've been doing it a while you're like [[01:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=3762.38s)]
*  Oh this [[01:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=3768.06s)]
*  This joke's gonna work better if I sit down [[01:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=3769.5s)]
*  For the minute leading up to it and then stand up for the joke. Yeah, or little shit like that [[01:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=3772.2999999999997s)]
*  You know, yeah that comedy nerd stuff. I've really started to dive into you know, yeah [[01:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=3776.54s)]
*  Well, you and me are more storytellers. I find you know, and there's not a lot of that these days [[01:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=3782.4599999999996s)]
*  Everything gets real cut and dried. Um [[01:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=3786.7799999999997s)]
*  And stand up are you [[01:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=3789.2599999999998s)]
*  And I noticed that you there was something up there that was dirty and you said f [[01:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=3791.2599999999998s)]
*  Do are you do you consider yourself clean? [[01:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=3795.8199999999997s)]
*  I think I just don't like I try not to be vulgar right like I noticed it started just [[01:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=3799.34s)]
*  It's I don't know and I probably have a very bad understanding of if I am vulgar and then i'm not trying to be vulgar [[01:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=3803.98s)]
*  Right, but I don't like I think some stuff it feels too graphic to me. It just like [[01:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=3810.06s)]
*  I don't know a lot of times it takes people out of it [[01:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=3816.2200000000003s)]
*  I feel you know, I feel like if a if like there's a lady listening and she hears, you know [[01:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=3818.38s)]
*  If she hears me say the pussy or you know, you know [[01:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=3823.6600000000003s)]
*  Ejaculation or something like that or ejac or something sometimes they [[01:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=3827.64s)]
*  They shut it off. Yeah. Ejax a tough one. I heard well ejac is easier [[01:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=3831.9s)]
*  Yeah, you get the point across. Yeah. Well, you know, it's interesting [[01:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=3836.62s)]
*  you know, I think it has to do with being authentic, right because [[01:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=3839.58s)]
*  I I don't i've very rarely do I hear people get offended by joey because it's so authentic coming out of his mouth, right? [[01:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=3843.18s)]
*  And if it's not authentic to you, then I think it offends people more easily because it also sounds [[01:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=3850.3s)]
*  That's a good point, do you know what I mean? Yeah, i'm never offended by anything joey says because i'm like that's just [[01:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=3855.18s)]
*  It's like when a white guy says the n-word kind of it's like, oh that sounds a little inauthentic. Yeah you [[01:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=3859.8199999999997s)]
*  You're trying a little too hard [[01:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=3863.8199999999997s)]

*  for a child that age [[01:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=4026.6200000000003s)]
*  It's hard for them to understand discipline and [[01:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=4028.94s)]
*  I [[01:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=4033.7400000000002s)]
*  I firmly believe especially that age all physical does is instill fear [[01:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=4034.54s)]
*  Especially because you have no understanding at that age. You know what I mean? I didn't hit my kids [[01:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=4040.46s)]
*  But I do think every kid needs to be parented differently like [[01:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=4045.18s)]
*  I have three older brothers were all different people were all responded in different ways [[01:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=4048.7799999999997s)]

*  I will tell you this for me for my kids and I think jacob is a good dude, man [[01:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=4060.06s)]

*  Those things look amazing. Yeah, have you seen the rivion truck? Uh, oh you gotta see who makes that? [[01:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=4621.68s)]
*  Um, i'm not sure can you uh [[01:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=4627.68s)]
*  Sorry, show me get you doing a million things dude, let me ask you one more question about your stand-up [[01:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=4631.599999999999s)]
*  because i'm i'm [[01:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=4636.4s)]
*  As i'm writing more and more you write on stage or you write here [[01:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=4638.5599999999995s)]
*  I write on stage. Yeah me too, and then I bring it off stage and then i'll [[01:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=4642.88s)]
*  Spruce it up. You know, do you when you write on your computer? [[01:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=4646.5599999999995s)]
*  Do you find that your jokes are different than the ones you come up with on stage? [[01:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=4650.5599999999995s)]
*  You know when you're sprucing it up, right? [[01:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=4655.36s)]
*  Yeah [[01:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=4657.44s)]
*  I find whenever I write whenever I sit down to write I don't write jokes the way I talk [[01:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=4658.4s)]
*  So the my best punchline has always come on stage because i'm i'm writing the way I talk [[01:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=4663.36s)]
*  Oh, yeah, and then i'll record it then i'll record it and then rewrite it down. Yeah [[01:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=4668.96s)]
*  Got it. Got it. Got it. But yeah, I find the funny thing for me [[01:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=4674.08s)]
*  I've had jokes that I wrote like 10 12 years ago [[01:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=4676.4s)]
*  That i've never tried on stage that i've always wanted to and i'm still afraid to try them sometimes so theo [[01:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=4679.36s)]
*  This special that i'm doing on march 4th [[01:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=4685.12s)]
*  I found my very first comedy cd [[01:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=4688.24s)]
*  Mm-hmm [[01:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=4690.48s)]
*  And I was like, let me just listen to this I made like 20 of them [[01:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=4691.759999999999s)]
*  And I thought there's a bunch of good premises here [[01:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=4695.36s)]
*  But i'm going to rewrite every joke and redo it really so I didn't punch them up [[01:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=4698.4s)]
*  I rewrote every joke under the the microscope of who I am now, right? [[01:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=4703.679999999999s)]
*  It was such a cool thing man [[01:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=4708.719999999999s)]
*  Because a lot of those jokes [[01:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=4711.28s)]
*  You know when I listen to old jokes, I would listen to the cd and I was like, oh, that's a good joke [[01:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=4713.759999999999s)]
*  But I thought it was over like if I got a laugh I was like, okay now I can move on [[01:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=4718.32s)]
*  Yeah as a younger comic you're like, well, I don't need to dig or you know [[01:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=4722.08s)]

*  It's it's up. I've never done this before. I've never rewritten an entire [[01:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=4735.04s)]

*  This is going to be good for all of us because hopefully [[01:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=4786.64s)]
*  We don't need hbo or netflix if we put this up man [[01:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=4790.56s)]
*  And me with my reach I sell a certain amount of tickets and I say to you I go theo we may not need netflix, man [[01:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=4795.36s)]
*  I sold this amount of tickets lord knows what you could sell. Yeah, and then you own it [[01:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=4802.16s)]
*  Do you know what I mean? Like right? So you're you're still making the [[01:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=4807.84s)]
*  Paycheck that netflix is going to give you right? [[01:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=4812.0s)]
*  But you get everything else on top of that and you know [[01:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=4814.16s)]
*  The special is going out to the people who want to see it because it's your people right? It's it's so i'm really [[01:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=4818.48s)]
*  Trying to not upset the apple cart altogether. Yeah, but uh, uh [[01:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=4824.08s)]
*  A good amount of tickets sold will change the business. It could change the business for all. Yeah, you know [[01:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=4829.52s)]
*  I mean look I love that I love the idea of trying it different trying something new trying [[01:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=4834.16s)]
*  You know to put the power back in the hands of people. Yeah, it's crazy. It's like um [[01:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=4838.96s)]
*  Yeah, it's crazy how much power that a lot of [[01:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=4844.72s)]
*  Uh these companies and they can flag you they can take stuff down. They can limit you [[01:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=4848.240000000001s)]
*  They cannot give you opportunities. It's just crazy to think that [[01:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=4853.2s)]
*  Um [[01:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=4856.5599999999995s)]
*  Especially since a lot of the media is just extremely liberal, which is fine [[01:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=4858.639999999999s)]
*  But it's not fine if that's the if that's the judgment [[01:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=4863.92s)]
*  Because there's going to become judgment with that. Yeah, and so there's going to come judgment against like certain types of comedians [[01:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=4868.4s)]
*  It's like it's like they're sometimes you could say they're just letting through what they want to let through [[01:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=4874.08s)]
*  You know and so that could be a little bit scary like nobody should be not have a chance [[01:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=4878.5599999999995s)]
*  You know because the guy at the finish line [[01:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=4883.36s)]
*  Wants to move the finish line or make it only for certain people. That's crazy, right? [[01:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=4885.76s)]
*  And i'm not saying that really applies here [[01:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=4890.4s)]
*  But it's really kind of like what it feels like sometimes like hollywood has become you know, I think [[01:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=4892.0s)]
*  There's no doubt. I think that [[01:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=4897.92s)]
*  you know [[01:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=4900.8s)]
*  my content has always been more geared towards the middle of the country than it has [[01:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=4902.08s)]
*  Like my worst room to perform in the country for me [[01:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=4907.28s)]
*  Consistently is that main room at the comedy star? Yeah easily my hardest room [[01:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=4911.0199999999995s)]
*  My toughest room. I'm not i'm not and never have been really one of the cool kids [[01:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=4916.0s)]
*  Do you know what I mean? And it's a cool that's a cool room man [[01:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=4920.879999999999s)]
*  And the people come down there are there to see the cool kids and I feel like my humor is just a little broader [[01:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=4923.599999999999s)]
*  My stories are a little broader. You know what I mean? They're relatable to a large [[01:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=4929.12s)]
*  Group of people but not so much on the coasts and those have been a harder rooms for me [[01:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=4934.08s)]
*  You know, i'm trying to think of what my hardest room has probably been [[01:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=4939.4400000000005s)]
*  You know where i've always had a tough time man. I feel like is in [[01:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=4943.4400000000005s)]
*  Minneapolis well that the house of comedy. Yeah, those ceilings are [[01:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=4948.3s)]
*  Thousands of feet high that's insane. Yo, so those those ceilings [[01:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=4953.18s)]
*  There's also a little because literally I tried to fucking jump off that thing. I landed on a bounce house. Yeah [[01:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=4958.56s)]
*  There's so much going on in that mall, yeah, it's on the 17th floor [[01:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=4964.8s)]
*  There are penguins in that mall, bro, dude. It's insane. There's a gun. There's a [[01:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=4969.360000000001s)]
*  There's a gun range next to the weed store. Yeah, I bought weed and then I went and shot guns [[01:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=4973.2s)]
*  Yeah puff puff pop pop there there there is and there's that water slide in the mall where you could when you can smell the herpes [[01:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=4978.88s)]
*  And that that that place is like you can't go to a water slide [[01:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=4986.400000000001s)]
*  In a mall unless you want every disease [[01:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=4989.76s)]
*  Like you yeah, you gotta cover your eyes. Get it on. Yeah, let's get in there man mouth open. Let's get into that [[01:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=4993.360000000001s)]
*  Yeah, your daughter's pregnant, but she's only been on the water slide [[01:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=4998.96s)]
*  Your dad's like where you been she's like water slide like who's that a black dog like no that's uh at the mall [[01:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=5004.8s)]

*  Well, here's why it seemed fake to me [[01:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=5020.719999999999s)]
*  Because the brother runs in there sets it up and then the kid comes in [[01:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=5022.719999999999s)]
*  It's just it's the exact way you would do something that was fake the only and I that was my first anything to [[01:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=5026.639999999999s)]
*  Except the kid. I just don't buy that you like I have kids [[01:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=5032.459999999999s)]
*  I just don't buy you go that mental [[01:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=5038.4s)]
*  But do you feel like I feel like he's always playing to the camera [[01:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=5041.5199999999995s)]
*  I feel like a little bit like he's playing to the camera, but also i'm a naysayer [[01:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=5044.5599999999995s)]
*  So I would say that I I would say what I just said [[01:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=5049.06s)]
*  And I love weird shit. So i'm just gonna believe it. Yeah. Yeah, you're right [[01:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=5052.58s)]

*  I love the fact at the end the guy tries to put the remote into his butt because it's like [[01:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=5060.02s)]

*  uh [[01:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=5126.820000000001s)]

*  You're like this just all feels like [[01:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=5179.46s)]
*  Part of mental illness, you know what I mean? Yeah [[01:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=5182.18s)]
*  and like um [[01:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=5185.14s)]
*  Especially for guys like this. I'm sure it's harder when you've been [[01:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=5186.98s)]
*  Such an alpha masculine dude where your body is basically the that when your brain starts to betray you [[01:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=5192.0199999999995s)]
*  That you just might you must not want to admit it. You know what I mean? [[01:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=5198.74s)]
*  It's sure it's hard enough like I I have had a hard enough time and i'm not some alpha [[01:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=5201.78s)]
*  ultra-masculine [[01:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=5207.759999999999s)]
*  Dude [[01:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=5208.98s)]
*  But for these guys to admit that their brain is betraying them must be the hardest step for them, you know [[01:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=5210.0199999999995s)]
*  It's a good point man. I didn't really I hadn't really thought about that [[01:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=5215.54s)]
*  Yeah, because it's total opposite of everything of like the weights and the yeah ability and the push through it [[01:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=5218.02s)]
*  Yeah, yeah push through it. It's total opposite of everything that they've heard [[01:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=5223.78s)]
*  Yeah, I can't imagine man. And I think some of the come down of being like a hero [[01:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=5228.02s)]
*  I mean this guy was a he was great at football. I I thought he was still I can't believe he [[01:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=5232.18s)]
*  you know, I think it had been five years since he last played which I found was kind of amazing, but [[01:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=5238.1s)]
*  um [[01:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=5242.58s)]
*  You know, maybe I wonder if he knew that I that I had suffered, you know with uh, [[01:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=5243.86s)]
*  With drinking or drugs and maybe that's why he had reached out at some point. I don't know [[01:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=5248.339999999999s)]
*  He never said anything like that. Yeah, I just found it kind of interesting [[01:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=5251.94s)]
*  Maybe he was just a podcast fan, you know, I don't know [[01:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=5256.259999999999s)]
*  But you know, I do find that like um, or podcast listeners people do reach out though [[01:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=5259.219999999999s)]
*  you know, I talked a couple weeks ago or maybe a couple months ago on uh, [[01:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=5264.82s)]
*  Fight her and the kid about my daughter and her being in rehab and all that stuff and more people reached out [[01:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=5270.66s)]
*  um, and I do find that when when um, [[01:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=5279.139999999999s)]
*  And I don't know if it's part of being in the program or part of being in recovery [[01:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=5282.34s)]
*  Where you know that the more people that reach out it almost makes that other person feel better [[01:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=5285.78s)]
*  Do you know what I mean feeling less alone? I I guess oh, yeah [[01:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=5290.5s)]
*  And so maybe that's part of the thing that he you know [[01:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=5293.62s)]
*  He understood that that's where you were coming from too and it just made him feel less alone. Maybe I don't fucking know [[01:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=5295.86s)]
*  Yeah, I don't know. I wish he'd have led some since you know, I I don't know [[01:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=5301.54s)]
*  I mean, yeah, like I'm sure he was communicating with a lot of different, you know people but he was just [[01:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=5305.219999999999s)]
*  I don't know. Uh, it's just sad to think that a guy was at a you know, [[01:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=5310.0199999999995s)]
*  That had checked into a hotel and had been there for almost a month. It seemed like or three weeks [[01:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=5313.7s)]
*  um [[01:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=5318.9s)]
*  And that he had by the way if you're in a hotel for more than two weeks [[01:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=5320.339999999999s)]
*  Something's up. Yeah more than two weeks. Yeah [[01:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=5324.74s)]
*  In the same place in Bradenton florida if you're in a hotel for more than two weeks [[01:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=5327.86s)]
*  I mean look at this guy just do it as a yeah [[01:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=5332.58s)]
*  Physical specimen apparently a really nice guy. I mean but also how uh the the effect of alcoholism if you look at it like [[01:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=5335.78s)]
*  He just finished playing five five days ago days or five, uh, five years ago. Yeah [[01:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=5343.86s)]
*  Can you put any other information? Can you go to another article? Do you mind shawn? [[01:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=5349.7s)]
*  But did they say how he is it say anything else does it say how he died? Let me see [[01:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=5353.22s)]
*  Whatever he was found dead in a florida hotel room [[01:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=5359.54s)]
*  38 [[01:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=5363.54s)]
*  Housekeeper dude, you know those house keys anytime i've been high on drugs or whatever [[01:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=5365.599999999999s)]
*  That's the scariest thought is like that. That's who's gonna come in and think about that. They're a mom [[01:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=5371.54s)]
*  They're a person too, you know, you know, it's not like they can just put you, you know sweep you up and then you know [[01:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=5375.62s)]
*  I mean they gotta probably like rope the room off now now. They got one less room. They're being able to rent out [[01:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=5381.9400000000005s)]
*  They've seen some housekeepers have seen some [[01:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=5388.26s)]
*  Shit, yeah, we need to get a good housekeeper on here shawn housekeeper. I always thought dude [[01:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=5391.6s)]
*  A book I would read tomorrow [[01:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=5397.38s)]
*  Is a book just from anonymous housekeepers talking about weird things that they've walked in and found in hotel rooms [[01:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=5399.3s)]
*  I'll tell you one right here and rip vince and jackson man, and uh, and just so sorry brother [[01:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=5406.179999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I just can't imagine him getting stuck inside of his own head and thinking he probably couldn't say anything anybody [[01:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=5411.86s)]
*  But how fast you have to be drinking for alcoholism to progress when you just played football five years ago. I feel like [[01:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=5416.9s)]
*  That's pretty quick [[01:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=5423.94s)]
*  Yeah, because to kill yourself with alcohol usually takes quite a long time, right? [[01:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=5425.7s)]
*  Maybe I mean I mean, but I would just I would speculate he probably couldn't be drinking as much during his career [[01:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=5430.42s)]
*  So that's what i'm saying like they had a kid from my hometown. He just died this young fella named court [[01:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=5436.1s)]
*  uh [[01:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=5441.9400000000005s)]
*  Named after the play space, you know, yeah, and he died and he just drank himself to death [[01:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=5443.46s)]
*  I mean just crazy and when I think about i'm like man [[01:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=5448.26s)]
*  yeah, he was always drunk every time I saw him like [[01:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=5451.700000000001s)]
*  Yeah, that kind of stuff just doesn't end well man. And um, i'll tell you this [[01:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=5455.14s)]
*  So one time I had [[01:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=5459.14s)]
*  I was doing comedy somewhere and a girl that i've been seeing or some girl I just met or something [[01:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=5461.38s)]
*  uh, and I ended up sleeping in the same bed, right and I don't remember if we [[01:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=5469.14s)]
*  I probably remember but I just don't [[01:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=5475.38s)]
*  I'm either i'm not sharing if we had sex or if we just made out or if she just slept over. I don't know [[01:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=5477.780000000001s)]
*  I don't I don't know and uh [[01:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=5482.5s)]
*  But in the morning she had gotten her period, you know while she was asleep menstrual cycle [[01:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=5485.3s)]
*  So she left. Okay. Yeah, she left. Yeah, I don't know [[01:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=5491.78s)]
*  I don't know. Maybe she won a grammar contest or something, you know, maybe she won a punctuation [[01:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=5497.22s)]
*  Maybe she was maybe punctuation phil had seen his shadow, you know, yeah and it was gonna be uh [[01:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=5503.38s)]
*  That she was celebrating but um [[01:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=5510.1s)]
*  anyway, so uh [[01:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=5512.66s)]
*  I I went to the um [[01:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=5514.74s)]
*  The cleaning lady, you know, and I noticed oh the sheets have blood on them [[01:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=5518.34s)]
*  So I should probably say something to clean lady. It's just not a nice surprise [[01:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=5522.02s)]
*  Probably to get so I went and the lady didn't speak any english [[01:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=5525.06s)]
*  And I didn't know what language she spoke because I hadn't really met anybody that had spoken different languages [[01:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=5527.9400000000005s)]
*  so i'm literally like, uh, [[01:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=5533.22s)]
*  Uh [[01:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=5537.22s)]
*  and I was just like making a bed shape with my hands and then I was like like uh, [[01:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=5539.06s)]
*  Who? [[01:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=5543.78s)]
*  I didn't know how to tell her. Yeah. Yeah, so i'm like [[01:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=5548.099999999999s)]
*  Yeah, that was pretty wild dude, so here's the story so I heard this story on our first start of comedy so [[01:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=5559.219999999999s)]
*  There was a guy who was a headliner, right? And he said well [[01:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=5565.379999999999s)]
*  I was doing a show somewhere. I don't even know where maybe like rochester or something or texas [[01:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=5570.02s)]
*  and [[01:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=5575.780000000001s)]
*  He said after the show some hot girl came like beeline for me after the show [[01:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=5576.900000000001s)]
*  Because you know like at funny moments if you do the show then you kind of go to the bar [[01:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=5581.620000000001s)]
*  Yeah, you know and so you migrate especially when like you're just coming up. It's like where you go to like show your feathers [[01:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=5584.820000000001s)]
*  Sell some mercy if there's any ladies and you're at the bar and you're pretending that you're like not noticing who's coming over [[01:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=5591.700000000001s)]
*  But you know, oh you're heavily noticing. Yeah, and if nobody comes over it hurts a lot [[01:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=5597.62s)]
*  so [[01:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=5602.42s)]
*  Anyway, this guy says i'm at this i'm at this this lady comes over and she's like beeline it for me [[01:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=5603.38s)]

*  She said let's go back to your hotel [[01:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=5611.62s)]
*  She says let's go back to my place [[01:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=5614.42s)]
*  And the guy's like man, you know, he's thinking I gotta leave in the morning or whatever. You know, let's go back to my hotel [[01:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=5616.34s)]

*  Let me see [[01:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=6114.28s)]
*  By tuesday morning the residents of colorado city texas were getting anxious more than 24 hours had passed since a deadly arctic blast [[01:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=6115.64s)]
*  Knocked out power across the state [[01:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=6121.8s)]
*  residents turned to a community facebook group to ask whether the small town plan to open warming shelters while others wondered if [[01:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=6123.96s)]
*  Firefighters could do their job without water colorado's mayor chimed in [[01:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=6130.66s)]
*  Um less than comforting message. He said no one owes you or your family anything [[01:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=6135.24s)]
*  Mayor tim boyd wrote i'm sick and tired of people looking for a damn handout [[01:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=6140.52s)]
*  What? [[01:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=6144.52s)]
*  Uh that the lazy residents find their own ways of procuring water and electricity immediately drew backlash later on tuesday boyd announced his [[01:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=6145.320000000001s)]
*  Resignation and admitted he could have used better words. How do you procure electricity? [[01:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=6151.8s)]
*  like what [[01:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=6157.24s)]
*  Right. Okay. Uh highlight how one of the worst winter storms in decades is testing the limits of the embrace of [[01:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=6158.76s)]
*  Self-sufficiency and rugged individualism in texas. So it's a good question, man. Like I don't know [[01:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=6165.22s)]
*  You know, I was thinking about this the other day. Um, so will you grab me an extra water by chance here? [[01:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=6170.52s)]
*  Thanks, man [[01:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=6175.08s)]
*  Um, how would you do survival? [[01:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=6176.52s)]
*  Well, I was thinking about this the other day [[01:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=6178.84s)]
*  So i'm talking to my friend in in louisiana and he said oh there's rolling blackouts [[01:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=6180.040000000001s)]
*  So some friends are coming over tonight because we have power tonight, right? I said, okay, that's interesting. So it made me think like [[01:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=6183.8s)]
*  What if the power company i'll take the death [[01:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=6191.080000000001s)]
*  so [[01:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=6194.280000000001s)]
*  Thanks, brother. So what if the power company like [[01:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=6195.160000000001s)]
*  Like the power company is not a guarantee for like it's a it's part of society that we've gotten to we're lucky enough to have like [[01:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=6199.0s)]
*  This thing the structure, you know [[01:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=6204.92s)]
*  But yeah, like what if it went out like [[01:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=6207.16s)]
*  So, I don't know where this mirror was coming from [[01:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=6210.12s)]
*  I mean, that's probably certainly the best way to word things if you're the leader [[01:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=6211.64s)]
*  But I mean if it's people sitting in a home, they're freezing to death [[01:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=6214.84s)]
*  Yeah [[01:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=6219.16s)]
*  And it's you know [[01:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=6219.4s)]
*  At some point you have to start a fire for yourself or you have to go to somebody's house that like you have to also take [[01:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=6220.68s)]
*  Action true, but you don't want your leader to be like every man for himself. That's basically not the message. You know what I mean? [[01:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=6225.72s)]
*  But that's a great point, you know, your leader is supposed to be your leader [[01:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=6232.2s)]
*  Let everybody else panic, but if you're panicking it's it's over, you know [[01:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=6235.4s)]
*  But it's one thing to tell people to get water because there's snow outside. So, you know, there's moisture you can figure that out [[01:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=6240.839999999999s)]
*  Procure your own electricity. Look, I mean I wouldn't even if I went first of all, I'm gonna have to google procure [[01:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=6247.62s)]
*  I don't know exactly what it means. I think I do I think it's how you treat ham [[01:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=6254.92s)]
*  Yeah, let's go back to the yeah [[01:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=6261.0s)]
*  Uh at least 10 deaths in texas have been linked to the winter storm since monday according to used chronicle [[01:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=6263.0s)]
*  So yeah, I mean it's wild. I think I think maybe this guy was probably just upset about other stuff [[01:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=6268.04s)]
*  And probably attached it to this. Yeah [[01:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=6273.72s)]
*  But if you were going to procure your own electricity, what would be your first move? I'd probably get a generator gas power generator [[01:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=6276.36s)]
*  Or I would start burning stuff [[01:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=6283.08s)]
*  I mean it's tough. That's one of the things you can't burn it outside because this the storm is obviously gonna [[01:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=6286.52s)]
*  That's a good point, but you can't burn it inside either because of the gas. Yeah. Yeah, you know what I mean? [[01:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=6292.12s)]
*  So the heat that's the thing that I I don't know exactly how people were doing it unless you had the generator, right? [[01:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=6296.68s)]
*  So yeah, I think that's a good point. So I guess maybe they're thinking yeah fine other people that have generators [[01:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=6304.92s)]
*  I guess it's also tough with this kind of article. You don't know if people's cell phones are still working [[01:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=6309.24s)]
*  You don't know if the roads are able that people can drive on [[01:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=6313.8s)]
*  Um, I wish they knew they would say what set this man off, but yeah if you're the leader [[01:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=6317.24s)]
*  I think you probably got to find a better way to lead. Yeah, you can't you can't come out and be like hey you pussies [[01:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=6322.04s)]
*  Procure some electricity. I'm like, well, I don't even know what that means man [[01:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=6329.4800000000005s)]
*  I don't have any electricity to google procure. So you're gonna have to break it down for me a little better [[01:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=6333.08s)]
*  Yeah, but if you're in your house yelling first help, but you also have legs at work. It's like [[01:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=6338.2s)]
*  Then that's on you also [[01:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=6343.64s)]
*  but I think one of the big issues we have in america today theo is that people have [[01:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=6345.32s)]
*  Forgotten that two things can be true at the same time. Yeah [[01:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=6351.72s)]
*  Two things can be true at the same time, you know, whether you're talking about this pandemic [[01:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=6355.96s)]
*  Where two things can be true at the same time do masks cure everything? Nah, they don't you can still get it if you have a mask [[01:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=6361.24s)]
*  Yeah, but is it possible that they help? Yeah [[01:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=6367.4800000000005s)]
*  Right, so there's two things people are saying you're yelling at each other and both of what you and I are saying [[01:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=6371.56s)]
*  Are the same are true. You know what I mean? It's possible for two things to be true this also [[01:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=6377.0s)]
*  Should you wait to die? No [[01:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=6382.76s)]
*  But is it up to you to procure electricity? Yeah, probably not not at first. Yeah, do you know what I mean? Like so I think it's [[01:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=6385.320000000001s)]
*  that's the thing like [[01:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=6393.0s)]
*  We've we've lost the ability to go. Yeah, that can be true [[01:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=6395.0s)]
*  What i'm saying is also true, but that can be true. Also, yeah, there's no there's no room for two sets of truths [[01:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=6398.36s)]
*  Which most things have yeah most things have two sides and most of the time [[01:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=6404.759999999999s)]
*  Both those sides have truth to them. Yeah, that's why people are so it's so easy to to pick a side now, right? [[01:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=6411.96s)]
*  We're so tribal now [[01:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=6417.799999999999s)]
*  It's not that there aren't we can't find facts. There are too many facts available [[01:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=6419.48s)]
*  Yeah, so I can find a fact that'll back up whatever the fuck I want to tell you is true [[01:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=6423.24s)]
*  I can find a fact online an article online a news site online that'll back me up [[01:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=6427.8s)]
*  You know what that does that makes me seem smart that gives me a fucking hill to stand on [[01:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=6433.5599999999995s)]
*  So I never have to listen to you. Oh, yeah, do you know what I mean? I just saw it online [[01:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=6437.48s)]
*  And everybody in your echo chamber says the same thing. So it must be true [[01:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=6442.36s)]
*  But both two things can be true at the same time. Yeah, that's a good point man ability to see [[01:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=6445.88s)]
*  Um, they just had this ufc girl that lost her job. Did you see this this korano girl? [[01:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=6450.2s)]
*  Yeah, man as a jew I think it's not good [[01:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=6454.679999999999s)]
*  Yeah, what did you have any thoughts on it man? Look, I think the equivalent is a complete false equivalency of what she's making here [[01:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=6458.2s)]
*  a complete [[01:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=6466.5199999999995s)]
*  false equivalency the fact that [[01:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=6468.12s)]
*  She has said some things that upset people [[01:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=6472.2s)]
*  And they're going they're going after her online is not even close to what jews [[01:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=6475.48s)]
*  Had to deal with in the 40s in germany. Oh, yeah, it's it's not even it's a however [[01:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=6481.24s)]
*  This is we we have to stop [[01:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=6490.4400000000005s)]
*  Canceling people [[01:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=6494.74s)]
*  For having different ideas than we have. Yeah, that's it [[01:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=6496.76s)]
*  Even if their ideas are wrong, even if their ideas are deemed wrong. Yeah [[01:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=6500.280000000001s)]
*  it's like it's gotten to this place where it's like [[01:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=6503.88s)]
*  If somebody [[01:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=6506.6s)]
*  Because then you end up with a herd of people who will just never say anything [[01:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=6507.88s)]
*  But they're angry all the time, right? And so it's nick cannon to me was the best example [[01:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=6512.04s)]
*  When I heard what he said, I was like, oh this dude just doesn't get it. No [[01:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=6517.64s)]
*  Yeah, he's yeah, he's just reading like some bad. He watched some bad. Uh malcolm malcolm x [[01:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=6522.4400000000005s)]
*  He's regurgitating some some false narratives and i'm not saying malcolm x is bad [[01:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=6527.16s)]
*  I'm saying he watched some outtake of ferricon or something like there's some videos that get passed around even by smart people that I [[01:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=6531.72s)]
*  Know that i'm like are you seriously sharing this? [[01:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=6537.4800000000005s)]
*  Dude, I could not agree with you one that goes around. It's like that. Oh, uh, [[01:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=6541.64s)]
*  White people are afraid of black people got in power that they would treat [[01:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=6545.72s)]
*  White people like they treated black people and i'm like this is insane. I haven't seen that one. Is that a ferricon one? [[01:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=6549.320000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I think it was a ferricon one but just some of the stuff that like [[01:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=6555.320000000001s)]
*  I don't know just like it's just so like [[01:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=6558.68s)]
*  I don't know. I just I can't believe some people would share some things that they share, you know [[01:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=6561.48s)]
*  I just think this seemed probably first of all unnecessary [[01:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=6566.68s)]
*  I think if you feel like you can't be heard, which I think you can't if you have if you have like [[01:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=6570.28s)]
*  It's not even if you're not like [[01:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=6576.92s)]
*  Almost openly because they had that silence is violence thing like during blm. Like if you're not openly [[01:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=6579.72s)]
*  Liberal a lot of times I feel like you definitely get stared at for not making a lot of the same statements, you know [[01:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=6586.28s)]
*  this [[01:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=6593.5599999999995s)]
*  here's the thing man, but like [[01:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=6595.08s)]
*  we [[01:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=6597.799999999999s)]
*  We're making people scared [[01:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=6599.48s)]
*  To speak so you drive people underground. Yeah, and when you drive people underground [[01:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=6601.639999999999s)]
*  What happens is they get angrier and angrier and angrier and angrier and then it probably erupts in something like this [[01:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=6606.28s)]
*  And then some happens and then some happens and for me like [[01:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=6611.96s)]
*  Look nick cannon was the perfect example when I read it [[01:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=6615.88s)]
*  I'm like this dude just needs to be take him to Auschwitz take him to the places [[01:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=6618.92s)]
*  That can show him exactly what he's not hearing about this history [[01:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=6623.64s)]
*  right and and by the way somebody did I think julian edelman the dude from the [[01:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=6627.8s)]
*  Patriots jew I believe he's the one who took might have taken the can of Auschwitz and sat down introduced him to some rabbis [[01:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=6632.04s)]
*  The rabbis are like here's the history of jews and nick cannon was like got it [[01:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=6639.8s)]
*  got it right and [[01:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=6643.8s)]
*  But we've stopped even allowing that julian edelman goes at nick right on twitter [[01:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=6646.36s)]
*  We've stopped allowing there to be [[01:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=6651.0s)]
*  I've always said the number one way you learn something is by someone really showing you by hand. Yeah [[01:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=6654.36s)]
*  and instead of like people offering to do that now [[01:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=6659.48s)]
*  they [[01:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=6663.16s)]
*  They take people's jobs away they [[01:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=6665.4s)]
*  Denounce them they make them. I don't know they like they I guess they cancel them like I feel like yeah [[01:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=6668.36s)]
*  Maybe it's better if someone says [[01:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=6674.12s)]
*  I think you don't understand some things dude. Some people are racist [[01:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=6676.12s)]
*  And it's hard to get through there and some people are just ignorant to it and ignorant [[01:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=6680.919999999999s)]
*  I don't mean that in a they're ignorant people but they're ignorant about this thing. Yes [[01:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=6685.08s)]
*  I don't mean that in a negative way, right? So to me [[01:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=6688.5199999999995s)]
*  You know julian edelman getting in there with nick cannon and nick cannon meeting with rabbis [[01:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=6692.36s)]
*  That's education right? And so what that does is when you cancel them you make them angry. He hates jews more [[01:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=6697.48s)]
*  That's it's their fault. I lost my job, right and he perpetuates it [[01:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=6704.28s)]
*  instead of that it stops there hopefully and so and a guy with a good with a [[01:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=6708.44s)]
*  Loud microphone can be like hey, this is actually the way it is now. Yeah, there's some people I just don't think you reach [[01:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=6713.719999999999s)]
*  Oh, and by the way from cool hand luke some people you just can't reach. Oh, yeah [[01:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=6720.5199999999995s)]
*  So you so you get what you had here last week? Yeah [[01:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=6723.88s)]
*  Um, but but I think man that it's all about being able to sit down and talk to people [[01:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=6727.56s)]
*  Yeah, because canceling people gets [[01:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=6733.240000000001s)]
*  It doesn't do well. I think it's also losing some of its appeal and it's making people really turn away from a lot of hollywood [[01:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=6735.72s)]
*  it's like [[01:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=6741.320000000001s)]
*  So with these people just cancel anyone who? [[01:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=6742.280000000001s)]
*  Like and it's not in this instance, you know, I mean this is I mean, you know [[01:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=6745.08s)]
*  It's like some of this seems pretty intense, but she must have felt for a long time like she can't say anything [[01:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=6748.6s)]
*  Yeah, she can't speak [[01:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=6753.64s)]
*  Um, look, I don't agree with a lot of the things that she's posted and I don't think any of them [[01:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=6755.160000000001s)]
*  Mean that she should have been canceled off that show. Yeah, I just don't think that's the right message to send again [[01:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=6761.0s)]
*  When you're pushing a group of people underground because they think differently than you that is dangerous. That's how you have uprisings [[01:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=6767.0s)]
*  That's how you get a bunch of angry people [[01:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=6774.4400000000005s)]
*  Fighting back because whether it's true or not look man [[01:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=6777.0s)]
*  It's perception your perception of how things is are is your reality, right? [[01:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=6779.799999999999s)]
*  Whether it is reality or not, right? [[01:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=6784.759999999999s)]
*  So if you have say two million people who feel like they're being persecuted whether they are or they aren't [[01:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=6786.44s)]
*  And being pushed under the ground where they are they aren't it's gonna bubble up. There's no way for it not to yeah [[01:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=6791.16s)]
*  And so I just feel like we're going about this in the wrong way. A lot of times there's some people who do deserve to get [[01:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=6796.839999999999s)]
*  Cancelled. Oh, yeah, I think there's some people who yeah, yeah, there's people who you know, there's people all over the place that probably deserve uh [[01:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=6804.04s)]
*  Probably is definitely some sort of some sort of reprimanding some sort of real. Yes action against them, you know [[01:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=6812.28s)]
*  Um, but it is it's definitely like it's become a place a lot of social media has become a place where you can't [[01:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=6819.5599999999995s)]
*  It's not even like it's like they group everybody [[01:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=6825.72s)]
*  I feel like there's a lot of grouping of white and poor white people that [[01:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=6828.6s)]
*  um [[01:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=6834.04s)]
*  They're all racist or they're all this way or they're all dumb or they're all ignorant. It's like [[01:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=6834.92s)]
*  Man, it's so hard to be poor and white like don't you understand like I think it's hard to be poor dude in anything [[01:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=6840.84s)]
*  But why does one color of poor get treated differently? [[01:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=6846.280000000001s)]
*  By the media than another color does man that just baffles me sometimes [[01:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=6850.280000000001s)]
*  Well, I just think that and I grew up poor too man, like we grew up in no car and you know [[01:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=6854.2s)]
*  um, I remember walking to school and we just rode our bikes and we had to borrow a car to go grocery shopping and [[01:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=6859.72s)]
*  You know, um [[01:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=6866.2s)]
*  I wore hand-me-downs [[01:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=6868.12s)]
*  Because I had three other brothers. I wore damn I wore hand-me-downs until I was like 12 or 13 [[01:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=6870.599999999999s)]
*  They started off as overalls and they finished his pants. Yeah, man [[01:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=6876.2s)]
*  I mean I didn't have like, you know what I mean? So I get it [[01:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=6878.84s)]
*  I just think that [[01:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=6882.12s)]
*  It's not that white poor people are treated differently. I just think they're not [[01:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=6884.44s)]
*  Portrayed at all like it's the and they haven't been for a while visually visually [[01:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=6889.5599999999995s)]
*  We're not being asked to [[01:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=6895.32s)]
*  Feel sorry for or support that community. Yeah, and I I don't know the exact reason for it man, you know [[01:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=6898.12s)]
*  And I think all media is [[01:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=6904.679999999999s)]
*  Unfortunately [[01:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=6908.74s)]
*  Intentionally divisive because I think fear [[01:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=6910.74s)]
*  Motivates people to do things more than anything else [[01:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=6913.94s)]
*  The thing that's going to motivate you to do something the most is for me to get on camera and say hey everybody [[01:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=6916.92s)]
*  These people this group of bad people are coming to take something away from you something you already have [[01:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=6922.92s)]
*  Nothing motivates you to do something and somebody come to take some shit. I already have do you know what I mean? [[01:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=6927.5599999999995s)]
*  That'll get you scared guns rights, whatever it is you're coming to get think about this dude [[01:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=6932.92s)]
*  Yeah, think about the mask [[01:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=6938.5199999999995s)]
*  And i'm just using this because it's current and and for me guys [[01:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=6940.68s)]

*  I don't think i'm going to die from corona [[01:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=6948.6s)]
*  But you know what? I don't want whatever the fuck those people are having because it sounds terrible [[01:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=6950.280000000001s)]
*  Yeah, two weeks of that sounds terrible. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I agree. So so and do I have underlying health issues? [[01:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=6954.120000000001s)]
*  I don't think so [[01:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=6959.64s)]
*  But I also know other people that do and the mask is no big deal to me [[01:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=6960.84s)]
*  But here is how crazy people get [[01:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=6964.92s)]
*  So it's all about [[01:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=6968.040000000001s)]

*  Nothing's being taken away from us. I grew up with that. I see what you're saying. The rules are you right? [[01:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=6983.24s)]
*  I grew up with that. So it just seems totally normal to me. But why is it any different? [[01:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=6987.400000000001s)]
*  the [[01:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=6992.92s)]
*  So what i'm saying is if you said to me [[01:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=6993.64s)]
*  Hey, you can go into a restaurant with people wearing masks and no shoes or shoes and no masks [[01:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=6995.72s)]
*  I'd be like no shoes because i'm not gonna get a i'm not getting sick, but it's just an [[01:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=7000.76s)]
*  Irreasonable law rule that was already there that we all already accept right? [[01:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=7005.9400000000005s)]
*  But now that i'm telling you you gotta do it now is my rights [[01:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=7012.04s)]

*  You're taking something away from me that i've always just taken for granted now [[01:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=7018.120000000001s)]
*  Obviously, that's not the whole thing but that is got to do with it. You're taking it from that's a part of it [[01:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=7023.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's definitely a part of a lot of things. I think yeah, it's like you're taking something away from me. It's like yeah [[01:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=7028.12s)]
*  Just think of the seatbelt, dude [[01:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=7033.4s)]
*  The seatbelt is something the government makes you do [[01:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=7035.48s)]
*  Because they're telling you it's better for you. Yeah [[01:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=7038.36s)]

*  You know what I mean? I that kid they can't make me wear a seatbelt. Well, yeah, they can't yeah [[01:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=7047.8s)]
*  And you've just accepted. Yeah, it's just different man when you start to get things [[01:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=7052.04s)]
*  Changed or taken from you that you feel like you should have a choice over [[01:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=7056.4400000000005s)]
*  It's it'll fuck with you as an adult. Yeah, it does [[01:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=7059.96s)]
*  I think and especially as you're in it as you become an adult because those are things you're used to yeah [[01:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=7062.6s)]
*  It's just like yeah [[01:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=7066.28s)]
*  And then you start to feel like if I lose this and it's going to be other things [[01:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=7067.4800000000005s)]
*  And when does this kind of stop a hundred percent? Um, a hundred percent. Yeah, it's interesting with the mask thing, man [[01:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=7070.76s)]
*  It's really interesting [[01:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=7076.12s)]
*  I think the tough part for me sometimes is when I have to be like in a doctor's office or in a place where [[01:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=7077.24s)]
*  You have to keep it on the whole time and then it's like it starts to be like [[01:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=7083.72s)]
*  You lose the ability to you don't even feel human a lot of times [[01:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=7087.8s)]
*  You're just like you're stuck in this thing and they're stuck in that thing [[01:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=7091.639999999999s)]
*  And you're just kind of getting done whatever business you need to get done and there's no value in like, uh [[01:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=7095.48s)]
*  Being like a human anymore. And then I think you attach that if you then attach that [[01:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=7101.639999999999s)]
*  to the fact that there is um [[01:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=7106.92s)]

*  It definitely feels like to me that things should be open [[02:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=7277.32s)]
*  And we should keep real good care of our senior citizens give them some money [[02:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=7280.6s)]
*  So that they're able to take care of themselves. Yeah, and let everybody else go back to work man. That's what it feels like to me [[02:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=7285.400000000001s)]

*  Too much nepotism. I feel like not enough chances for the regular person that's moving there [[02:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=7671.3s)]
*  Um, and I could be wrong. I could be totally wrong, but there's just thoughts that have been in my head [[02:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=7676.26s)]

*  and [[02:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=7726.9800000000005s)]
*  I felt like [[02:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=7728.5s)]
*  I feel so much more creative and relaxed here [[02:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=7730.02s)]
*  Because I don't feel like competing all the time. Oh, yeah [[02:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=7733.22s)]
*  I'm not waking up wondering what other people are doing or great point. Do you know what I mean? [[02:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=7736.34s)]

*  Yeah [[02:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=7746.66s)]

*  Why am I in my own head? [[02:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=7754.66s)]
*  Competing with these people. Yeah, we're not competing. Do you know what I mean? Right? I haven't done that here [[02:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=7757.280000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I think uh [[02:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=7763.22s)]
*  I think well, I still have my apartment there [[02:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=7766.1s)]
*  so it's like I and i'll probably go back and spend some time there, especially as the summer comes back and [[02:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=7767.9400000000005s)]
*  um, and it's a nice, you know to get to the beach and also to do [[02:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=7773.22s)]
*  Do podcasting and stuff like that, but it's nice to not have [[02:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=7776.900000000001s)]
*  It just never felt like it always felt like work. It felt like the second I got off the plane. I was at the office [[02:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=7781.22s)]
*  And just like man I'm at this and then if I was if I was home for two weeks [[02:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=7787.9400000000005s)]
*  I'm at i'm just in an office for two weeks whether i'm sleeping i'm at the in my bed at home or anywhere [[02:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=7792.0199999999995s)]
*  I'm just always like this never-ending [[02:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=7796.74s)]
*  buzz of uh [[02:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=7800.5s)]
*  of office stuff and then I I really feel like [[02:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=7802.82s)]
*  some of the creativity there has they've it's been so separated it's like [[02:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=7806.98s)]
*  So second third fourth generation just people getting opportunities on their name and stuff [[02:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=7812.98s)]
*  that they've lost sight of like a lot of the [[02:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=7818.099999999999s)]
*  and not only lost sight but kind of separated themselves from a lot of the places in america where a lot of good [[02:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=7821.94s)]
*  storytelling comes from and like [[02:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=7826.48s)]
*  um [[02:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=7828.58s)]
*  you know and a lot of creativity like creativity is kind of a group process, you know, and when you [[02:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=7829.86s)]
*  When you really minimalize yourself to very [[02:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=7834.58s)]
*  you know [[02:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=7837.78s)]
*  Kind of narrow lanes of okay thought [[02:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=7839.94s)]
*  I think [[02:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=7843.62s)]
*  And i'm not saying if they're right or wrong [[02:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=7844.9s)]
*  But it it very much leaves you in this place where you can't really tell a joke if there's no [[02:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=7846.58s)]
*  If there's not a wall to bounce it off of sometimes and it's like [[02:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=7852.42s)]
*  They just have created this place where I don't even you see some of these new comedy shows and comedy specials [[02:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=7856.74s)]
*  And it's like there's not even any jokes in it. It's not comedy [[02:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=7862.42s)]
*  No, it's not comedy. It's crazy and I don't know how they get out of that how they get out of this like [[02:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=7866.18s)]
*  Spiral of oh you're worse than I am you're you messed up you messed up you messed up you're bad [[02:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=7872.26s)]
*  You you know, it's I I think podcast has helped stand up more than anything [[02:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=7878.099999999999s)]
*  Because no doubt it's allowed god man, right because people have gotten used to [[02:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=7882.98s)]
*  Remember when people used to talk to us about jokes per minute [[02:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=7888.34s)]
*  We've got to be yeah, there's not enough to 70 jokes per minute. Yeah, there's none of jokes per minute in that story [[02:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=7891.54s)]
*  You're like, oh, but i'm telling a story like it's got to be so I really feel like it has helped [[02:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=7895.7s)]
*  But I think what started happening in la for me anyways [[02:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=7901.7s)]
*  Is that everybody kind of looked at joe or sagura or you or bert? [[02:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=7905.94s)]
*  and it it it um [[02:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=7910.74s)]
*  the [[02:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=7913.54s)]
*  path to success [[02:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=7914.66s)]
*  Started to become very repetitious very copycat. And so I think a lot of the creativity [[02:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=7916.66s)]
*  Had it's like, you know a couple years ago [[02:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=7923.14s)]
*  Maybe 10 years ago everybody who left new york comedy scene sounded like a tell everybody had his cadence [[02:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=7925.7s)]
*  Yeah, do you know what I mean? Yeah, not because they were ripping it off [[02:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=7930.98s)]
*  but he who was that big of an influence, right and so I think there's so much of the influence from the top that [[02:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=7933.219999999999s)]
*  Creatively a lot of the stuff that's coming out is starting to look the same. We haven't had that next wave of [[02:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=7940.639999999999s)]
*  Who's doing something different interesting, you know what I mean? [[02:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=7949.379999999999s)]
*  So right and I wonder if there's and maybe something different does come out of a lot of this it usually always does [[02:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=7952.42s)]
*  Yeah, I think so. I think right [[02:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5dPV97Et0&t=7957.86s)]
