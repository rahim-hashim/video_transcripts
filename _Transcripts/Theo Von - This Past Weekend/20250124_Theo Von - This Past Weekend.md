*  What's been happening? [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=58.599999999999994s)]
*  Oh, this, I, good day, first of all, let me say that to you. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=60.6s)]
*  And this is the day that we have been given. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=63.599999999999994s)]
*  And yeah, and I'm happy to be here and alive with you today [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=67.84s)]
*  on planet Earth at this time in existence. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=74.1s)]
*  And here we are. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=77.7s)]
*  What is going on? [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=81.25999999999999s)]
*  Oh, this, I fricking, I'm in Los Angeles, right? [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=83.44s)]
*  And I forgot that I have a Jeep Cherokee out here. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=86.82s)]
*  And it's probably maybe six, seven years old or something. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=92.5s)]
*  And I forgot that I wasn't driving my car at home, right? [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=97.39999999999999s)]
*  In Nashville. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=105.44s)]
*  So the other day I thought my car got stolen. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=106.32s)]
*  So I called the police or what, or, you know, yes, [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=109.63999999999999s)]
*  the authorities, they come, the guy, we're standing, [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=114.78s)]
*  I'm like telling him, describing my car, [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=119.3s)]
*  which is a cyber truck. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=122.94s)]
*  And I know that's alarming. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=124.06s)]
*  And it makes a lot of people sad and that's okay. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=125.8s)]
*  But I'm describing, and it is, it's a, it's very, [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=128.88s)]
*  it's like driving like a molar filling [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=133.4s)]
*  for the Statue of Liberty. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=137.94s)]
*  You just feel like you're driving this huge molar filling [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=139.22s)]
*  for some gigantic thing. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=141.46s)]
*  But anyway, besides all that, I called the police. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=145.44s)]
*  I'm telling the guy, took a while, [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=149.16s)]
*  waited probably 40 minutes. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=151.79999999999998s)]
*  I'm telling the officer, explaining the vehicle and stuff. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=152.76s)]
*  And I reach him my pants. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=156.48s)]
*  I have car keys, right? [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=160.16s)]
*  I have car keys. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=161.48s)]
*  And the guy, and I said, well, these are the keys to it. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=162.72s)]
*  And I gave them to him and he presses the button [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=166.48s)]
*  and the fucking, dude, I, the car keys, [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=169.72s)]
*  the car was like fucking five cars away. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=174.76s)]
*  I thought that I had, I was driving my cyber truck. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=180.68s)]
*  I just forgot. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=183.16s)]
*  I thought I was driving my truck and I just, [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=184.2s)]
*  I forgot, cause I just hadn't been in Los Angeles [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=186.48s)]
*  in so long and I just forgot that I was driving [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=189.72s)]
*  this Cherik, the Jeep. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=193.72s)]
*  So the Jeep, like I'm a multi-car owner. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=196.04s)]
*  But anyway, absolutely embarrassing. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=200.16s)]
*  And just ridiculous. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=204.85999999999999s)]
*  And just, I was like, I was to describe the vehicle to him. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=205.7s)]
*  Suffice, turn that off. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=212.06s)]
*  And describe the vehicle. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=213.73999999999998s)]
*  And first of all, when you're describing a cyber truck, [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=214.85999999999999s)]
*  you're like, yeah, it looks like a, [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=216.56s)]
*  if you fucking can't, it's a fucking, [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=218.38s)]
*  it looks like a UFO that couldn't make it. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=222.54s)]
*  That's kind of what, it's just very, [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=225.33999999999997s)]
*  it's like, it looks like a, [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=227.76s)]
*  like you're driving a sand wedge or something. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=230.42s)]
*  So just that alone is bizarre. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=233.66s)]
*  And then I was like, yeah, I don't know what happened. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=236.74s)]
*  I ran inside of here for a little bit [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=239.54s)]
*  and I came out and it was gone. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=240.7s)]
*  So I'm telling that and then I have the keys. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=242.34s)]
*  And then I think I, that's where my glitch was. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=244.18s)]
*  I was like, yeah, and I guess I still have the keys [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=246.9s)]
*  and I give them to him. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=249.24s)]
*  He fucking presses the thing, the keys to my Jeep. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=250.07999999999998s)]
*  And bam, it's fucking right there. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=254.72s)]
*  So anyway, whatever. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=259.3s)]
*  That's where I'm at. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=261.56s)]
*  What else? [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=264.92s)]
*  Let's get into it, man. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=265.76000000000005s)]
*  I just got back from the inauguration in the USA [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=266.58000000000004s)]
*  and I was, let's play some, let's play, [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=269.88s)]
*  let's lead into it, the little instrumental. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=272.54s)]
*  ["The Little Mermaid"] [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=278.76s)]
*  ["The Little Mermaid"] [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=292.38s)]
*  Very beautiful. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=312.0s)]
*  That's Canon in D major right there. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=312.84000000000003s)]
*  If you're into that sort of thing. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=316.36s)]
*  And yeah, I was just, I took a red eye flight. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=318.08s)]
*  And so I got in probably 6.30 in the morning, [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=323.53999999999996s)]
*  had to get dressed in the car [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=327.18s)]
*  and took this suit that I have on, [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=329.62s)]
*  got dressed in the car, went to, [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=333.02s)]
*  got dropped off at a hotel, right? [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=336.21999999999997s)]
*  And you couldn't go within like five blocks of the hotel. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=338.62s)]
*  You had to, you couldn't drive up to it. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=341.94s)]
*  So you got dropped off. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=346.14s)]
*  That's when it's walking. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=347.34s)]
*  And it's cold, you know, when you're like, [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=348.76s)]
*  you know, you're hurrying because we had to get there [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=351.28s)]
*  by a certain time, by 8 a.m. to make sure [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=353.28s)]
*  that I could be like legit or whatever. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=357.11999999999995s)]
*  So I guess, so I'm changing in this thing. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=361.35999999999996s)]
*  And I didn't know the man, the man, [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=363.73999999999995s)]
*  the driver of the car that picked me up. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=365.52s)]
*  He was a, he was from a, like a United Nations area [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=368.96s)]
*  or whatever, you know what I'm saying? [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=374.64s)]
*  This guy was a, he, we probably got him in a trade [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=375.92s)]
*  or something, I don't know how he got him. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=381.34000000000003s)]
*  But he didn't speak a lot of English and that's okay. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=383.42s)]
*  And I didn't speak a lot of his language. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=386.86s)]
*  So we just were, you know, we were different. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=388.26s)]
*  We were verbally kind of different people. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=391.40000000000003s)]
*  And so anyway, I'm like, and I've never, you know, [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=396.18s)]
*  I'd have to change in this car. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=399.02000000000004s)]
*  And so it was just like, yeah, it's weird. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=400.62s)]
*  And so first of all, I had to change down [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=404.71999999999997s)]
*  to complete nudity, you know, down to just, you know, [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=406.0s)]

*  So I was like, you know, I was very, just, you know, [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=1216.44s)]
*  I was like, holy shit, dude. [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=1221.96s)]
*  So then we get on the bus, right? [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=1224.3600000000001s)]
*  So I'm sitting next to Danica Patrick, okay? [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=1228.28s)]
*  We're sitting in front of Evander Holyfield, dude. [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=1231.84s)]
*  You know, and people used to watch him wrestle. [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=1236.72s)]
*  And he is a legend. [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=1240.32s)]
*  We're on this bus. [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=1241.6000000000001s)]
*  And then John Shahidi, Kyle from NELC, [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=1242.84s)]
*  and Kyle Foregard, or Furgard, Fregard, not sure. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=1246.6000000000001s)]
*  Is it Furgard? [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=1253.8s)]
*  Fregard. [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=1254.76s)]
*  Kyle, they call him Kyle, obviously I can tell why, [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=1256.76s)]
*  because people, because it's after that, [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=1259.2s)]
*  it's fucking, you're bothering people. [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=1261.1200000000001s)]
*  But Kyle from NELC, right, who looked like he was going [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=1263.16s)]
*  to court to not get in trouble for a serious crime, [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=1266.96s)]
*  like a business crime, like he looked dashing. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=1269.88s)]
*  He really did, the man looked dashing. [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=1273.04s)]
*  And, oh, and then behind them, Jay, oh, and then [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=1277.48s)]
*  Alex Bruschewitz, John Shahidi, and then in the back, [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=1284.6s)]
*  it was Jake Paul's Logan Paul. [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=1289.6s)]
*  Behind them, Pam, Logan's mom, and Corner McGregor, [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=1292.76s)]
*  the fucking cuttie kid of Ireland. [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=1301.36s)]
*  And it was just, and it was awkward. [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=1306.12s)]
*  You could see also on everybody's face, [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=1309.08s)]
*  because I guess there'd been issues [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=1310.6399999999999s)]
*  between the Pauls and the McGregors. [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=1311.9599999999998s)]
*  They'd been having beef online or whatever, [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=1316.0s)]
*  and so they'd been beefing, and so there was issues there, [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=1317.8s)]
*  and I didn't know it, but so it was just awkward, you know? [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=1320.8799999999999s)]
*  So I think there was some energy there. [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=1323.56s)]
*  But it was also, people was, they said fair play [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=1326.44s)]
*  to each other, both at each side said fair play [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=1330.12s)]
*  to each other, boys, and we're gonna have a good day, [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=1332.92s)]
*  and we're here for something bigger than us, you know, [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=1335.44s)]
*  for, to witness just a country that has freedom. [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=1339.68s)]
*  And so the bus took off, took a while. [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=1343.16s)]
*  We probably sat there 40 minutes, [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=1346.1599999999999s)]
*  a lot of laughter and fun stuff. [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=1347.6799999999998s)]
*  You know, just crazy, dude. [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=1351.12s)]
*  I mean, I can't even believe I'm sitting next to, hold on. [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=1352.36s)]
*  I'm sitting by Evander Holyfield, dude, right? [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=1357.9199999999998s)]
*  And you could tell, he can feel like these other boxers [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=1361.8s)]
*  in the back, but we know who the fucking dog is, you know? [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=1364.6399999999999s)]
*  And I looked at him like, I'm on your team, brother, [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=1369.8799999999999s)]
*  you know what I'm saying? [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=1373.12s)]
*  If shit gets fucking risky out here, [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=1373.96s)]
*  if things get crazy, you know, then you, [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=1376.56s)]
*  you know what I'm saying? [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=1380.6799999999998s)]
*  And he's getting up in years, [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=1381.52s)]
*  but if you gotta even use me as a white walker [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=1383.0s)]
*  just to help you get out of here, [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=1385.0s)]
*  mate, let us, whatever we gotta do, man. [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=1387.08s)]
*  So, but yeah, but I just, I truly can't believe [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=1390.6799999999998s)]
*  that I'm on this, you know, it's just, it's a, you know, [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=1393.76s)]
*  do you find yourself in certain moments where you're like, [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=1396.84s)]
*  this is pretty crazy that you're in a moment, right? [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=1398.9199999999998s)]
*  And it's just regular people, for sure. [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=1403.16s)]
*  But it, you're like, this is, like, who did we trick [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=1405.24s)]
*  or whatever to get in here, you know? [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=1409.44s)]
*  Like, how did we, I don't know. [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=1413.68s)]
*  I don't know, and we didn't trick anybody, [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=1418.04s)]
*  but there's a part, there's just like, yeah. [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=1419.64s)]
*  You're like, what are we, you know, one of these things [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=1422.0800000000002s)]
*  is not like the other, it just seemed like, I don't know. [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=1426.28s)]
*  And I'm not trying to say that like in a self pity [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=1429.72s)]
*  or like pity me way, I just, or like, oh, [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=1431.52s)]
*  I don't deserve to be there. [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=1433.84s)]
*  I'm just like, it just was fucking kind of a surprising [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=1435.0s)]
*  moment, we're all going to a presidential inauguration. [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=1438.28s)]
*  I don't know these people, do you know? [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=1441.08s)]
*  I don't know, I mean, I know John Shahidi really well, [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=1442.6s)]
*  he's actually a close friend of mine who runs Happy Dad. [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=1445.32s)]
*  And I know, who else was it? [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=1450.04s)]
*  I, well, I paid for one of Evander's fights before, [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=1454.76s)]
*  for sure, when they had early pay per view, I know. [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=1459.3999999999999s)]
*  And I paid for one of the Paul's fights. [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=1462.0s)]
*  And I'd met Jake and Logan, but I don't know him, you know? [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=1468.0s)]
*  So anyway, there we all are, we're on a bus, [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=1471.7199999999998s)]
*  we get over by the Capitol, and they say, [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=1474.84s)]
*  as soon as the thing ends, we have six minutes [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=1478.1599999999999s)]
*  to get out of the venue and back onto the bus [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=1480.9599999999998s)]
*  before they're going to shut down certain roads. [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=1485.04s)]
*  And that was one of the biggest things. [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=1488.3200000000002s)]
*  All along the outside, when I've been walking towards [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=1490.2s)]
*  the hotel and everything, it's probably 10 to 30 degrees [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=1492.92s)]
*  or 40 degrees or 34, six, seven degrees, right? [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=1497.2s)]
*  It's not a ton of degrees, but it's not, [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=1500.96s)]
*  it's not like no degrees, but it's like, [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=1503.72s)]
*  some degrees, you know what I'm saying? [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=1506.8400000000001s)]
*  But there's military everywhere, every fucking, [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=1511.3600000000001s)]
*  you even like, like there'd be military, [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=1514.0800000000002s)]
*  there's like SWAT team, you know, police, sheriffs, [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=1517.56s)]
*  under, like a Marine. [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=1523.48s)]
*  Every, there was people in high, there was like, [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=1529.52s)]
*  like I went to use a mailbox, I opened it up, [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=1531.88s)]
*  it's a fucking military guy in disguise, [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=1533.72s)]
*  dressed up like a male thing, like, ah, fuck, you know? [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=1538.84s)]
*  He still took two of the letters for me, so thank you. [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=1544.32s)]
*  But yeah, everything, you just couldn't, [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=1548.3999999999999s)]
*  you gotta be careful, there was military everywhere, [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=1549.8799999999999s)]
*  so you couldn't piss outside kind of vibes, you know? [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=1552.52s)]
*  Anyway, so we're driving, but all the roads, [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=1556.1599999999999s)]
*  there's like barricades everywhere, there's like trucks [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=1558.8s)]
*  that they've just brought in to park [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=1561.24s)]
*  at all these intersections, all around this capital area, [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=1562.8799999999999s)]
*  like any corner you would pass on the way in, [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=1566.72s)]
*  because we'd circled the entire thing, [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=1570.08s)]
*  trying to find a way to get closer to this hotel, [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=1571.76s)]
*  so I hadn't had to walk, just because it was so brisk out. [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=1573.84s)]
*  So the thing, but there was, some of them [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=1578.32s)]
*  had cement barricades, some of them just had like, [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=1581.08s)]
*  big trucks, some of them had SU war, [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=1583.44s)]
*  little war trucks or whatever, it's like a little tank, [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=1588.68s)]
*  but with, and they made them for regular people, [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=1591.28s)]
*  but they were fucking sad, it was like H Hummers, [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=1594.76s)]
*  they had those real Hummers. [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=1598.64s)]
*  They had, what else? [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=1600.76s)]
*  They just, there was things stopping everywhere, [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=1604.28s)]
*  and there was military personnel all over, [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=1606.8s)]
*  or police personnel all over. [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=1608.6799999999998s)]
*  So anyway, the bus ride takes a while, [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=1612.12s)]
*  you gotta go through these certain streets, [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=1613.6s)]
*  they have these big barricades set up, [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=1615.28s)]
*  and then you have to kind of like turn the corner, [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=1616.84s)]
*  and then straighten your bus out to make it through [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=1618.6s)]
*  these huge like kind of cage steel walls that they've put up, [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=1622.6399999999999s)]
*  so the bus can just fit right down the middle of the walls, [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=1627.1599999999999s)]
*  like the full intersection is, the full street is closed, [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=1629.68s)]
*  and it's just been narrowed to this one, [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=1632.5200000000002s)]
*  like the middle lane kind of it, [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=1636.8400000000001s)]
*  and so that took a while, like doing different turns. [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=1638.6000000000001s)]

*  you got to meet a lot of military folks. [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=2089.7799999999997s)]
*  So just to see all of them in their dress garb, you know, [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=2091.62s)]
*  I mean, that was probably one of the coolest things. [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=2095.62s)]
*  You're in the Capitol and there's all, [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=2098.06s)]
*  everybody's in their garb and it's just very regal, [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=2099.8599999999997s)]
*  very regal looking. [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=2104.2999999999997s)]
*  And yeah, and people were amped and there was fun stuff. [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=2106.14s)]
*  And then every now and then you'd shake somebody's hand [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=2111.18s)]
*  and they had a wet hand or whatever, [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=2113.14s)]
*  and you're like, oh fuck, you know, somebody, [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=2114.58s)]
*  get this fella a bag of flour, somebody, [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=2117.18s)]
*  or just get him one of those pool chokes [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=2119.66s)]
*  and let him just chalk his hand up before he shakes again, [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=2124.58s)]
*  before he meets somebody, you know? [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=2127.14s)]
*  But yeah, and then so that kind of happened. [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=2131.14s)]
*  We sat there for a while, probably 30 minutes, [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=2134.18s)]
*  and then, and so we all slipped off and just slunk out [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=2136.9s)]
*  and got into a special area beneath some stairwells [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=2141.46s)]
*  where a lot of the military was back there [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=2145.42s)]
*  and they had, they was drinking chicken broth, [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=2147.12s)]
*  hot chocolate and coffee. [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=2150.34s)]
*  And the government had given them a little bag [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=2152.42s)]
*  with a banana in it, you know? [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=2154.38s)]
*  You're like, dear God, these people putting their lives [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=2156.46s)]
*  on the line, right? [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=2158.66s)]
*  They're here to protect the president and we're fucking. [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=2161.6s)]
*  Somebody, I mean, and some of these bananas had been, [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=2166.38s)]
*  I don't wanna say they had been abused or whatever [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=2170.4s)]
*  by their owner or whatever, but they had been trafficked. [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=2172.44s)]
*  I don't know how they, but some of the bananas had, [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=2175.44s)]
*  you know, they're not, you know, [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=2179.88s)]
*  they're not gonna be put back in circulation. [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=2182.48s)]
*  I was surprised some of them were still in circulation. [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=2186.0s)]
*  And anyway, but the military personnel didn't care [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=2188.6s)]
*  and that was kind of a blast too. [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=2192.32s)]
*  That was probably the highlight of the whole inauguration [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=2195.0s)]
*  was seeing all the military folks [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=2197.56s)]
*  from all different branches, from police to like army, [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=2199.24s)]
*  Navy, SWAT, sweat. [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=2206.56s)]
*  There was just some gay guy wearing a sweatshirt [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=2210.92s)]
*  that said sweat on it. [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=2213.48s)]
*  Who else? [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=2216.04s)]
*  They had even stolen valor. [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=2216.88s)]
*  Even the people out there in stolen valor, [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=2218.44s)]
*  you were like, you know, it was an honor. [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=2220.16s)]
*  All of that, just, that was something great. [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=2223.2599999999998s)]
*  Sorry, this story's getting long. [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=2225.92s)]
*  So anyway, we got over there and we're just, [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=2228.56s)]
*  we hadn't eaten any breakfast, right? [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=2232.0s)]
*  I hadn't. [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=2233.44s)]
*  And so you're just, I'm just slurping chicken broth [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=2234.2799999999997s)]
*  and slurping hot cocoa, you know. [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=2236.56s)]
*  And anyway, so that was like a nice excursion [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=2238.16s)]
*  from sitting there. [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=2240.52s)]
*  We go back to our seats and my chair was bad. [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=2241.36s)]
*  I had a bad chair. [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=2243.96s)]
*  The chair had been, I don't know, [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=2245.2799999999997s)]
*  it was probably made in Charna or whatever. [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=2248.18s)]
*  It was just been one of those, you know, probably a chair. [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=2250.7599999999998s)]
*  Yeah, it was a chair that shouldn't be allowed to chair. [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=2254.18s)]
*  They should check these chairs, right? [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=2259.5s)]
*  They should breathalyze and whatever they should do. [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=2260.8199999999997s)]
*  But they did, whatever this chair, you know, [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=2263.62s)]
*  probably knew somebody or whatever and got in the building. [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=2266.2599999999998s)]
*  Anyway, it was kind of slagging a little. [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=2268.98s)]
*  My chair was kind of like, so when I sit down, [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=2271.98s)]
*  I had that fucking lean on me, you know what I'm saying? [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=2274.54s)]
*  That shoulder lean, that shoulder lean. [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=2277.8599999999997s)]
*  And suddenly, as soon as I sat like that, [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=2282.2200000000003s)]
*  a lot of black people kind of nodded at me [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=2284.66s)]
*  because once you had that lean on you, buddy, [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=2286.78s)]
*  it's a little bit of a kind of urban respect going on, [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=2288.86s)]
*  you know? [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=2291.66s)]
*  So I was like, okay, I'm in, I'm here. [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=2292.62s)]
*  So we sit down, the congregation starts. [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=2295.34s)]
*  The whole evening starts, the inauguration starts, [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=2297.54s)]
*  and it's very nice, man. [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=2301.62s)]
*  I mean, it's just, you know, [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=2302.94s)]
*  you're witnessing a piece of history [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=2303.98s)]
*  and you get to be there. [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=2305.54s)]
*  And it definitely felt like a lot of very regal people [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=2306.86s)]
*  and everybody was dressed very well and just fancy. [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=2312.1400000000003s)]
*  It was a diverse group, it felt like. [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=2317.2200000000003s)]
*  I don't know if that's true. [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=2322.26s)]
*  That's crazy to say that part. [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=2323.1s)]
*  But it was nice. [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=2326.46s)]
*  It was really nice. [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=2330.02s)]
*  And just like, yeah, just felt lucky to be there, [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=2331.06s)]
*  just to see it. [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=2335.3s)]
*  I was saying this this weekend on Twitter, [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=2337.38s)]
*  but some countries, they can't vote. [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=2339.34s)]
*  They don't have voting. [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=2341.14s)]
*  You can't go vote. [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=2342.2200000000003s)]
*  You just live. [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=2344.02s)]
*  And you feel like you don't have a say in how, [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=2346.02s)]
*  in the template that you operate in [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=2349.9s)]
*  or the universe that you're set up in, [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=2351.78s)]
*  you don't have a hand to raise ever. [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=2354.58s)]
*  But yeah, so it was wild to see that. [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=2360.94s)]
*  It was wild to witness it. [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=2365.3s)]
*  And then just the little things, [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=2367.0600000000004s)]
*  just like everybody just watching all the little things [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=2368.5s)]
*  at the inauguration, just the little moments [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=2371.1800000000003s)]
*  of little glances from the different people. [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=2373.1000000000004s)]
*  And it's like this whole changing of the guard [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=2375.46s)]
*  and it's like this tag team, it's like tagging in, [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=2377.78s)]
*  instead of tagging in your partner, [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=2381.1800000000003s)]
*  it's like tagging in your opponent, [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=2383.26s)]
*  which is just such a wild thing to witness in a sport, [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=2384.86s)]
*  if you look at politics, almost like a sport. [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=2388.82s)]
*  And so we sat there, everything was going pretty smooth. [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=2391.9s)]
*  And then at some point my chair broke, right? [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=2393.9s)]
*  The chair broke. [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=2397.14s)]
*  I fell, it fell. [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=2399.54s)]
*  I just, it fell, right? [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=2400.7000000000003s)]
*  I fell out, I don't know what to say it. [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=2402.02s)]
*  The chair like might've, I don't know what happened, right? [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=2404.62s)]
*  But the chair fell and I fell. [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=2408.58s)]
*  And it was like, oh dude, it was the worst, right? [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=2410.9s)]
*  It was embarrassing. [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=2413.98s)]
*  Because at first I thought, oh, people thought I did this. [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=2416.38s)]
*  Right? [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=2419.1800000000003s)]
*  Like I don't do, I don't like physical stuff. [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=2420.02s)]
*  I don't like the, like I'm not good at that type of stuff, [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=2424.06s)]
*  falling out of a chair, that type of shit, right? [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=2427.1s)]
*  That's for fucking clowns or shitty mimes, right? [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=2429.14s)]
*  Like a, like yeah, that's for shitty mimes, [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=2433.3s)]
*  the shitty mime type shit, I don't do that. [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=2435.7000000000003s)]
*  So the chair broke and then I was like, oh man. [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=2438.3s)]
*  And Sam Altman looked at me, the guy who made AI, bro, [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=2441.6600000000003s)]
*  he looks at me like, I was like, oh God, [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=2445.94s)]
*  that dude's never gonna come on the podcast. [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=2449.9s)]
*  I was like, dude, design me a chair right now. [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=2454.2200000000003s)]
*  Bro, I was like, design me some way [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=2457.1s)]
*  to get out of this embarrassment. [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=2458.78s)]
*  So that was kind of strange. [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=2462.02s)]
*  And then I got up and anyway, the thing carried on. [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=2463.5s)]
*  We snuck off one more time to get some more stuff [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=2468.2200000000003s)]
*  because it got long. [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=2470.78s)]
*  Some of the benediction got a little, [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=2472.46s)]
*  they were up there rattling and shit. [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=2475.78s)]
*  And then Trump came through, [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=2477.86s)]
*  he gave a very long speech in there. [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=2479.1s)]
*  I think addressed a lot of different things in there [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=2482.38s)]
*  that it was kind of like the B sides, [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=2487.3s)]
*  like things he maybe didn't wanna say [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=2488.98s)]
*  in the actual main part, but he said in there. [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=2490.2200000000003s)]
*  And then on the way back to the hotel, [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=2495.42s)]
*  our bus kept turning off. [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=2499.02s)]
*  It was experiencing breakage or whatever, or it was broken. [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=2501.6600000000003s)]
*  So we got out and just walked like the last few blocks [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=2506.7000000000003s)]
*  and that was kind of hectic. [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=2509.82s)]
*  Just because some of those people are pretty recognizable. [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=2513.1400000000003s)]
*  And just a lot of people were coming up pictures [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=2518.42s)]
*  and videoing and ask people from a different place. [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=2521.7400000000002s)]
*  It was just a lot. [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=2525.6600000000003s)]
*  It was like a lot of energy. [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=2526.5s)]
*  And it was kind of a little scary. [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=2528.6200000000003s)]
*  Like I don't have security. [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=2530.6200000000003s)]
*  I'm not saying I need security, [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=2532.1400000000003s)]
*  but you're just out there, you don't know what people are, [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=2533.38s)]
*  you know what I'm saying? [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=2535.1400000000003s)]
*  You just don't know what's going on. [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=2535.98s)]
*  So that was a little crazy. [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=2538.5s)]
*  Got back to the hotel and yeah, went home, [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=2540.34s)]
*  went to my hotel, which is maybe a mile away or something, [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=2546.58s)]
*  took a nap for a few hours [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=2550.42s)]
*  and then went to the ball later on. [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=2552.54s)]
*  And there was some issues about the chair. [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=2557.26s)]
*  I ended up like, well, here, let me tell about the ball. [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=2559.46s)]
*  So the ball, I guess they had a bunch of different balls [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=2562.82s)]
*  and I got a ticket to one ball, right? [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=2566.38s)]
*  And it was very nice. [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=2569.06s)]
*  It was called the Starlight Ball [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=2570.42s)]
*  and it was beautiful in there. [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=2571.6600000000003s)]
*  And I got dropped off, [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=2573.1800000000003s)]
*  you had to get dropped off blocks away. [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=2574.26s)]
*  And then they had a very long like snake walk [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=2576.3s)]
*  that you had to go on to get to the door. [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=2579.02s)]
*  And it was probably maybe probably a 20 minute walk, right? [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=2580.98s)]
*  And so it was cold out. [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=2584.62s)]
*  It was probably 25 degrees or something. [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=2586.5s)]
*  So you're walking out there and I didn't bring a coat, right? [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=2588.54s)]
*  Cause I didn't know, you know, I didn't, [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=2590.62s)]
*  I didn't think I guess. [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=2594.26s)]
*  And so I didn't think about a coat [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=2596.1s)]
*  and I didn't have a coat. [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=2597.7000000000003s)]
*  And so we finally get up to the front and they let you in. [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=2599.02s)]
*  And it was beautiful, you know, it's nice. [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=2604.02s)]
*  It's elegant, the fucking, they got curtains, [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=2606.14s)]
*  they got carp, the curtains were, [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=2609.38s)]
*  some curtains was 80 feet long, 90, 45, 75 feet long, baby. [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=2610.78s)]
*  They had curtains that had carpet on them. [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=2618.3s)]
*  Like these bitches, they had, you know, [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=2620.34s)]
*  they had everything in there. [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=2621.98s)]
*  They had a, the craziest thing I saw, [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=2623.82s)]
*  they had a ceiling fan. [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=2625.18s)]
*  It must've been 150 feet up in the air, dude. [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=2626.1s)]
*  I was like, what, how would you do it? [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=2629.3399999999997s)]
*  And so I kind of was like looking for the switch [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=2632.8199999999997s)]
*  for that low key for a while. [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=2634.8199999999997s)]
*  Let me see inside of the ball. [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=2637.8199999999997s)]
*  I got to see some people that I knew Joe Rogan was in there. [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=2639.18s)]
*  Mayor, oh, Ernie Johnson. [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=2642.66s)]
*  Who's the guy, speaker of the house maybe? [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=2646.86s)]
*  Mike Johnson. [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=2650.74s)]
*  Mike Johnson, baby. [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=2651.58s)]
*  Got to talk to him. [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=2653.14s)]
*  He's from Shreveport, Louisiana. [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=2653.96s)]
*  He's got a great sense of humor. [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=2655.3s)]
*  We got to joke around a little bit. [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=2656.6600000000003s)]
*  He had a few of his children with him. [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=2657.82s)]
*  Got to talk with them. [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=2659.0200000000004s)]
*  Wayne Gretzky was in there, the great one. [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=2660.86s)]
*  I saw him, dude, Wayne Gretzky had lost his tooth in there. [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=2663.34s)]
*  My tooth got chipped, right? [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=2667.98s)]
*  My tooth got chipped or something on a hard appetizer, right? [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=2670.1000000000004s)]
*  So Wayne's in there. [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=2675.6200000000003s)]
*  I told him that. [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=2677.38s)]
*  He goes, like that, showed me his mouth. [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=2678.5400000000004s)]
*  He's missing a whole tooth, dude. [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=2682.5s)]
*  Runaway train never going back. [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=2685.1s)]
*  He had that, but he's just gone. [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=2688.62s)]
*  I mean, he's a hockey player, so yeah. [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=2690.5s)]
*  But then they're looking on the floor for the tooth. [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=2693.62s)]
*  So for probably 10 minutes, I'm helping him and his wife [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=2696.14s)]
*  and somebody else, like a dentist or whatever, [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=2698.2999999999997s)]
*  but a dental assistant basically. [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=2702.3399999999997s)]
*  I think it was just a dude that liked guys or whatever, [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=2703.9799999999996s)]
*  but he was trying to help look for it. [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=2706.22s)]
*  And then, so we're looking for Wayne Gretzky's tooth, okay? [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=2707.9799999999996s)]
*  And I think he's like, yeah, I think, [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=2713.18s)]
*  I won't find a thought he said he had a couple, [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=2715.1s)]
*  he usually kept a couple extra on him, you know? [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=2717.1s)]
*  Because this is a hockey guy. [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=2719.14s)]
*  These guys, you know, you'll go to bed, [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=2720.3799999999997s)]
*  they'll have their wedding ring and a tooth on the nightstand. [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=2722.7s)]
*  You know, that's just the kind of guys they are, you know? [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=2725.18s)]
*  So yeah, he just had that empty net up top and it was, [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=2729.5s)]
*  but it was hilarious, dude. [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=2733.18s)]
*  We laughed and we took a nice photo together, [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=2734.2599999999998s)]
*  me, him, Mike Johnson. [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=2737.54s)]
*  And then I started getting some social anxiety in there. [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=2739.02s)]
*  That was a little bit hectic. [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=2741.62s)]
*  And what else was it? [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=2743.38s)]
*  I mean, it's just like a couple thousand people, you know? [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=2745.46s)]
*  And you can't be like, hey, [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=2748.86s)]
*  have you seen Wayne Gretzky's tooth, you know? [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=2749.94s)]
*  Like, so I would do that a couple of times. [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=2752.06s)]
*  I was like, yeah, have you seen Wayne Gretzky's tooth, [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=2754.18s)]
*  you know? [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=2756.3s)]
*  And I think a lot of people thought it was a euphemism [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=2757.14s)]
*  for something or whatever. [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=2758.7s)]
*  It was like a, kind of like something like that. [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=2759.54s)]
*  But yeah, anyway, I don't know if I'm gonna say this, [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=2763.54s)]
*  I don't know if they found it or not. [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=2769.02s)]
*  I got a touch base with them, but what a legend, dude. [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=2769.86s)]
*  What a legend, bro. [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=2772.94s)]
*  That was awesome. [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=2775.2599999999998s)]
*  So that kind of made my night, I think. [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=2776.1s)]
*  What else? [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=2780.62s)]
*  I saw Tony Henscliffe and Jeff Ross [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=2781.44s)]
*  and we joked around for about a half hour [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=2783.06s)]
*  over by the desserts. [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=2785.06s)]
*  The things that I did not enjoy, to be honest with you, [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=2786.42s)]
*  no judgment, but these are just things [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=2788.78s)]
*  that what it was like. [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=2790.58s)]
*  There was only probably 25 chairs in the whole place [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=2791.62s)]
*  for probably, I don't know, [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=2795.42s)]
*  maybe it was 2,000 people in there or something, [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=2797.18s)]
*  1,600 people. [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=2799.02s)]
*  Right, is that the right amount of people? [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=2801.5s)]
*  Maybe 1,000 people. [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=2803.2s)]
*  So they only probably, they might've had 40 chairs, right? [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=2805.18s)]
*  So it was like, if you saw a chair, it was like, [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=2808.8199999999997s)]
*  it got squid gamey in there, dude. [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=2812.74s)]
*  It was very, if you even hurt an ass cheek, [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=2815.1s)]
*  leave a fucking seat. [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=2817.7599999999998s)]

*  Everybody feels a little famous [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=3206.18s)]
*  because everybody is able to kind of promote themselves [[00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=3207.8599999999997s)]
*  if they want. [[00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=3210.66s)]
*  You know, what used to be like media [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=3213.18s)]
*  that felt like it was kept from people or controlled, [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=3215.2599999999998s)]
*  it just feels like it's just there now [[00:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=3217.66s)]
*  and you can make your own decisions [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=3221.3399999999997s)]
*  based on how you're consuming [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=3222.66s)]
*  or who you're consuming stuff through, I guess. [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=3226.42s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=3230.1s)]
*  I guess I don't have like a lot of macro level pictures [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=3231.02s)]
*  of that kind of stuff, but just to get to meet Sam Altman, [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=3233.8599999999997s)]
*  dude, the AI guy, like what? [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=3236.2599999999998s)]
*  And then there was just more, just like, [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=3241.64s)]
*  yeah, it was fascinating. [[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=3244.54s)]
*  I wish I had had, I was kind of burnt out. [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=3245.54s)]
*  It was very magnificent and had like a, [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=3252.7s)]
*  you know, a Cinderella type energy and stuff. [[00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=3257.8999999999996s)]
*  I'm just glad that I got to go to it. [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=3261.22s)]
*  I couldn't believe that. [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=3262.8599999999997s)]
*  There was a thing where, you know, [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=3264.14s)]
*  I thought Jake and Logan, [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=3267.18s)]
*  I thought Logan and Jake were messing with me. [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=3269.14s)]
*  They had videotaped, they were vlogging from the get, right? [[00:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=3271.3799999999997s)]
*  And I never spent much time around them, you know? [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=3277.06s)]
*  And I know that they're really successful [[00:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=3279.3799999999997s)]
*  and they're, I mean, they're tough guys. [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=3281.02s)]
*  Those are tough guys, right? [[00:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=3287.34s)]
*  No doubt. [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=3288.46s)]
*  So anyway, they put a clip of I fell out the chair, dude. [[00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=3289.86s)]
*  And I didn't do, I didn't know, [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=3293.08s)]
*  I knew that the chair had been bad. [[00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=3297.54s)]
*  The chair was faulty. [[00:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=3299.34s)]
*  It was a faulty chair. [[00:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=3301.06s)]
*  I don't know if that was CIA or whatever. [[00:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=3301.98s)]
*  No idea. [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=3304.5s)]
*  No idea how, you know, if there was a plan there. [[00:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=3305.82s)]
*  But anyway, the chair was faulty. [[00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=3310.18s)]
*  But then afterwards, somebody said [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=3312.8199999999997s)]
*  that they were forking with the chair, you know? [[00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=3314.66s)]
*  And so part of my brain was like, [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=3318.66s)]
*  oh, did they do something with it to egg it on, you know? [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=3320.9s)]
*  Like, you know what I'm saying? [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=3326.44s)]
*  If you see somebody who's like leaning on a crutch [[00:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=3327.2799999999997s)]
*  or whatever and then you bar their crutch, you know, [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=3329.98s)]
*  you leave town, you know? [[00:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=3332.2599999999998s)]
*  Cause you got priors or whatever and then they fucking, [[00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=3334.62s)]
*  they take that L, baby, that gravity L, baby, they fall. [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=3338.1400000000003s)]
*  So I just didn't know. [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=3342.02s)]
*  So I got in kind of this skeptical place. [[00:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=3343.1s)]
*  And I should have just checked in with Logan about it, [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=3347.98s)]
*  I guess, but they were recording everything. [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=3350.26s)]
*  So I didn't know if they were gonna record it or whatever. [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=3351.7400000000002s)]
*  And I just, I hadn't been around him that much, you know? [[00:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=3353.82s)]
*  And I didn't, I think I get nervous around like vlogging [[00:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=3355.78s)]
*  type of things because it feels like [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=3358.28s)]
*  your, somebody could be setting you up or something. [[00:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=3363.1s)]
*  I'm just not that familiar with that universe. [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=3366.18s)]
*  And then later in the day, [[00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=3369.8999999999996s)]
*  Logan Paul's made a video where he said, [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=3372.02s)]
*  he made a challenge about, oh, he said, [[00:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=3375.3799999999997s)]
*  if I was gonna put you through something, [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=3377.9199999999996s)]
*  I'd put you through a table, you know, not a chair, [[00:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=3379.06s)]
*  cause he is a wrestler. [[00:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=3381.06s)]
*  He's a WWE wrestler. [[00:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=3382.54s)]
*  I believe he's been a champion too, hasn't he? [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=3384.3799999999997s)]
*  Let me see. [[00:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=3389.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=3389.88s)]
*  Yeah, he was the WWE champion from November, 2023 [[00:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=3393.52s)]
*  to August 3rd, 2024. [[00:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=3397.2000000000003s)]
*  So, yeah. [[00:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=3399.6s)]
*  So I thought he, you know, so I thought that he, [[00:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=3402.2000000000003s)]
*  I thought that he wanted that, that he was, you know, [[00:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=3405.6s)]
*  then I thought he was creating like an online hype about it. [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=3408.26s)]
*  You know, I thought he was calling out the Rat King, [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=3410.7400000000002s)]
*  you know, and if you want, if you want the smoke, baby, [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=3413.4s)]
*  I'll fill your lungs, you hear me? [[00:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=3416.6800000000003s)]
*  Cause I'm gonna give you the truth, baby. [[00:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=3418.48s)]
*  And I'm gonna give you the trauma. [[00:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=3420.92s)]
*  Name the time and the place and the place and the time. [[00:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=3423.6s)]
*  Cause I got a clock and a globe and an ax to grind. [[00:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=3427.1600000000003s)]
*  From Alaska to Nebraska, from Maine to Fort Wayne. [[00:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=3431.84s)]
*  So that's where I was at. [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=3438.12s)]
*  And then we ended up talking in the morning and I just, [[00:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=3440.28s)]
*  I should have probably communicated. [[00:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=3444.52s)]
*  That was my part, and it was, [[00:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=3445.88s)]
*  I didn't communicate better. [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=3448.0s)]
*  And they weren't, they didn't, they didn't do anything. [[00:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=3450.32s)]
*  They were recording, the chair fell and it was ridiculous. [[00:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=3455.76s)]
*  And then they weren't trying to, [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=3460.32s)]
*  they weren't trying to wrestle. [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=3464.04s)]
*  I used to watch you wrestle. [[00:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=3465.88s)]
*  They weren't trying to wrestle. [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=3468.16s)]
*  And so, yeah. [[00:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=3469.4s)]
*  So no hard feelings there. [[00:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=3471.28s)]
*  Yeah, so I'm just self-responsibility. [[00:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=3475.6s)]
*  I think it was just a little bit of miscommunication [[00:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=3477.0s)]
*  to just not knowing each other maybe, [[00:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=3481.08s)]
*  not knowing each other's energy some. [[00:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=3482.44s)]
*  And I'll say this too, honestly, [[00:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=3485.76s)]
*  I had a great time hanging out with them [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=3487.52s)]
*  cause we also had had a great time that weekend. [[00:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=3489.56s)]
*  They were probably two of the guys. [[00:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=3492.4s)]
*  Yeah, we just, just joking around. [[00:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=3497.08s)]
*  I got to see how they interact with their mother. [[00:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=3499.8s)]
*  And I thought that that was very sweet, [[00:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=3502.58s)]
*  to be honest with you. [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=3504.88s)]
*  No home, no ditty or whatever, just like the way, [[00:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=3507.24s)]
*  and it was just all real genuine. [[00:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=3511.66s)]
*  You could tell that they have, [[00:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=3513.48s)]
*  yeah, you could just tell the affinity [[00:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=3517.48s)]
*  that they have for their mother and the same for them. [[00:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=3519.28s)]
*  Because a lot of families that grow up [[00:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=3522.08s)]
*  where the children are famous and stuff, [[00:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=3525.0s)]
*  they don't have the same fortune. [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=3526.82s)]
*  They don't have the same good fortune. [[00:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=3530.08s)]
*  So that was really cool actually. [[00:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=3533.08s)]
*  I admired that about them. [[00:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=3535.12s)]
*  Yeah, this honky zen monkey rolled up on me [[00:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=3539.04s)]
*  at the hotel at one point and was kind of just like, [[00:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=3542.16s)]
*  he was just kind of trying to say stuff to me [[00:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=3545.36s)]
*  and just, he was drunk, right? [[00:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=3547.7799999999997s)]
*  And he was just kind of kept spitting a lot. [[00:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=3549.56s)]
*  And it was just a lot for me. [[00:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=3551.44s)]
*  And he was just, his energy was super clear. [[00:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=3552.92s)]
*  He was like right up in my face kind of. [[00:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=3555.12s)]
*  And I told him I didn't want to really talk. [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=3556.6s)]
*  I was just, it had been a long day or whatever. [[00:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=3558.7s)]
*  And then he kept coming up and Logan and Jake [[00:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=3560.6s)]
*  both kind of just put a damn trompe wall [[00:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=3566.88s)]
*  right there in front of me. [[00:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=3571.28s)]
*  And I didn't need to be rescued, [[00:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=3573.28s)]
*  but I'm kind of glad they stepped in [[00:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=3576.2400000000002s)]
*  because it could have got a little weird. [[00:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=3577.56s)]
*  I was kind of, I was on edge a little. [[00:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=3580.7200000000003s)]
*  I just hadn't hit a meeting and all, just shit like that. [[00:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=3585.34s)]
*  I just got to take care of my own shit a little bit better. [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=3588.42s)]
*  But so yeah, what I'm saying is, [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=3592.38s)]
*  and nobody asked me to say this, [[00:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=3595.94s)]
*  we just, Logan and I had a call the other day, [[00:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=3598.58s)]
*  that shit was just confusion. [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=3600.1s)]
*  And yeah, that was just confusion. [[01:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=3602.04s)]
*  And then, yeah, I'm actually glad I got to, [[01:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=3606.86s)]
*  I'm glad I got to get to know them better, [[01:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=3612.2000000000003s)]
*  to be honest with you. [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=3614.9s)]
*  It was kind of a joy of the weekend. [[01:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=3616.26s)]
*  And what else was nice? [[01:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=3619.0200000000004s)]
*  I mean, it was all just crazy just to even, [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=3623.78s)]
*  even just to like stand around a Vanderhoof field [[01:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=3626.1800000000003s)]
*  and you're just like welcome to be around him, right? [[01:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=3628.94s)]
*  There's not like, he doesn't have, [[01:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=3630.8s)]
*  there's no, neither one of y'all needs to walk off [[01:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=3633.42s)]
*  because you're both in the same group. [[01:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=3635.5s)]
*  It was like you were at a field trip. [[01:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=3636.6000000000004s)]
*  That was it, that's what it was like. [[01:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=3637.82s)]
*  It was like when you were kids at a field trip [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=3639.34s)]
*  and it was like, okay, this is the B group [[01:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=3640.94s)]
*  and this is your chaperone or this is the L group [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=3642.7000000000003s)]
*  and this is your chaperone. [[01:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=3645.0s)]
*  And so that was us. [[01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=3646.16s)]
*  We had eight or nine of us. [[01:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=3647.24s)]
*  We had our chaperone and we were just, [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=3648.6s)]
*  we were just learning about civics [[01:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=3652.28s)]
*  and getting to see some of it firsthand. [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=3656.24s)]
*  And we really did like laugh. [[01:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=3657.98s)]
*  It was a fucking blast, dude. [[01:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=3659.36s)]
*  And yeah, I think maybe part of me, [[01:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=3661.44s)]
*  I wish they'd have asked if they'd have put the clip up, [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=3664.16s)]
*  fall into the chair out or whatever, [[01:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=3666.04s)]
*  but in the end, it's okay, it's all good. [[01:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=3667.24s)]
*  I don't have any ill thoughts towards them. [[01:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=3669.92s)]
*  Yeah, I thought that they were, [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=3676.0s)]
*  I thought they were cool guys. [[01:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=3677.24s)]
*  Maybe I need to quit saying that, dude. [[01:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=3678.48s)]
*  Obviously they're both married and I like women. [[01:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=3679.88s)]
*  But yeah, I kind of wish we would have fucking took that. [[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=3682.2s)]
*  I kind of wish we would have took it to the ring. [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=3686.48s)]
*  I think it was a part of me that was hoping, [[01:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=3688.48s)]
*  cause you know, the Rat King, baby, [[01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=3692.86s)]
*  I'll put him in the freaking mozzarella wheelchair, baby. [[01:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=3695.04s)]
*  You feel me? [[01:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=3698.0s)]
*  My finishing move is the tax evasion, baby. [[01:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=3699.12s)]
*  So, but that's every kid's dream to get in there [[01:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=3703.1200000000003s)]
*  and get body slammed and lose a vertebra, you know? [[01:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=3707.0400000000004s)]
*  In a sold out arena in Charlotte. [[01:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=3711.84s)]
*  I mean, who, you know, we can all dream. [[01:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=3714.1200000000003s)]

*  I would have gone, you can't miss it. [[01:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=3720.92s)]
*  You couldn't miss it if you got to go. [[01:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=3723.1200000000003s)]

*  It's like, I've learned a lot in the past year, [[01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=3749.8199999999997s)]
*  to be honest with you. [[01:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=3751.8399999999997s)]
*  I think anyway, you know, I think I have. [[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=3754.06s)]

*  Some people gave me a hard time about going [[01:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=3768.1400000000003s)]
*  to the inauguration or supporting a party or whatever. [[01:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=3769.7400000000002s)]
*  I don't think about, you know, I don't, [[01:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=3771.9s)]
*  I support, I do what I want to do for me. [[01:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=3774.2200000000003s)]
*  And you can do what you want to do for you, you know? [[01:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=3777.7000000000003s)]
*  But nobody owns my support. [[01:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=3781.7000000000003s)]
*  Nobody owns my support for anything, I don't think. [[01:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=3784.9s)]
*  You know, except maybe my family. [[01:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=3790.94s)]
*  And even then, I'll keep it away from them sometimes. [[01:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=3794.54s)]
*  So I don't know about what else. [[01:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=3797.7000000000003s)]
*  Let's take a call that came in. [[01:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=3801.34s)]

*  Thank you for calling. [[01:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=3817.54s)]
*  I'm from Triquant, Louisiana. [[01:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=3819.62s)]
*  Oh yes, Mike Johnson country. [[01:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=3821.26s)]
*  And you know, he's speaker of the house. [[01:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=3822.98s)]
*  And I liked his attitude. [[01:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=3825.54s)]
*  I liked his energy. [[01:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=3826.7400000000002s)]
*  You know, and I'm curious to see what this whole new camp, [[01:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=3828.3s)]
*  what they do in there. [[01:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=3830.7200000000003s)]
*  I'm curious to see, you know, [[01:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=3831.9s)]
*  cause it's a motley, it's a motley group [[01:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=3833.54s)]
*  that they got going in there. [[01:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=3836.0s)]
*  And I want to get to meet some of them. [[01:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=3837.7000000000003s)]
*  I want to get to talk to some of them and learn some stuff, [[01:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=3841.06s)]
*  you know, and also ask them some promises. [[01:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=3843.54s)]
*  You're going to do this, you're going to do this. [[01:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=3846.1800000000003s)]
*  And then we can see if we can hold them to it. [[01:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=3848.26s)]
*  If we get to keep podcasting for years, [[01:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=3850.2200000000003s)]
*  we'll be able to hold them to it. [[01:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=3852.2200000000003s)]
*  Hey, you said you were going to get to do this. [[01:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=3853.1400000000003s)]
*  Why didn't it happen? [[01:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=3854.7400000000002s)]
*  Or why did it happen? [[01:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=3855.62s)]
*  You know? [[01:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=3857.42s)]
*  So that kind of stuff really intrigues me. [[01:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=3858.26s)]
*  You know, are we going to get lobbyists [[01:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=3860.54s)]
*  and foreign countries and APACs [[01:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=3862.7400000000002s)]
*  and all these different people out from [[01:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=3866.06s)]
*  interfering with our candidates [[01:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=3868.7s)]
*  and interfering with our lobbies? [[01:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=3871.54s)]
*  Or how does it work? [[01:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=3873.02s)]
*  And also, am I just delusional [[01:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=3873.8599999999997s)]
*  and I just don't know the whole system? [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=3875.74s)]
*  And if that's the case, then educate me on it. [[01:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=3878.46s)]
*  Because there's also just a cost to doing business [[01:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=3883.3999999999996s)]
*  in some things, you know? [[01:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=3885.7799999999997s)]
*  Like sometimes there's a cost to doing business. [[01:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=3888.1s)]
*  You know, like you could go set up a fruit stand [[01:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=3892.22s)]
*  or something or a little watermelon stand [[01:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=3894.22s)]
*  or something, a little banana shop [[01:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=3898.62s)]
*  or something in the corner of a street. [[01:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=3902.3399999999997s)]
*  You could do that. [[01:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=3904.22s)]
*  But you have to pay a permit, right? [[01:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=3905.54s)]
*  You have to, it's just the cost of doing business. [[01:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=3906.8999999999996s)]
*  So sometimes I wonder if there's, [[01:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=3909.62s)]
*  you know, what the truth is out there. [[01:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=3911.14s)]
*  I want to learn more about that. [[01:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=3912.4199999999996s)]
*  Let's hear more, sorry. [[01:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=3913.54s)]
*  I've called you a few times. [[01:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=3915.2999999999997s)]

*  on Inauguration Day. [[01:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=3926.22s)]
*  I had actually said something to my husband [[01:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=3928.22s)]
*  over the weekend that I sure hope Theovon goes to Washington [[01:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=3931.9s)]

*  I appreciate that. [[01:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=3942.98s)]
*  Yeah, Theovon went to Washington, I guess. [[01:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=3943.86s)]
*  Fievel goes west or whatever. [[01:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=3945.68s)]
*  Fievel goes to section eight. [[01:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZRvZDFcj0A&t=3947.86s)]
