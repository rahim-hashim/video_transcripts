*  everything. It was just, it was in you. Yeah. What would you have? You think if you had a [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=396.0s)]
*  superpower, you think fly. Really? Yeah. I'd fly. That'd be awesome. Would it though? Think of how, [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=399.36s)]
*  dude, if you even stuck your head out of a window and you're going super fast. Yeah. I'd be chill [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=404.4s)]
*  about it. Dude. Imagine if I floated into this room and sat in the chair. Dude, those things are [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=408.56s)]
*  tough, dude. I was struggling early. You got to use your shirt. You got to. I'm so happy. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=413.52s)]
*  I didn't do that on camera. You got to use your shirt. I was in there, dude, struggling. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=419.44s)]
*  Hold on, dude. Stop, bro. That water's not for weaklings, dude. This thing's broken. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=424.56s)]
*  It's crazy. I had to put it on my shirt and just fucking wrench it. God, that would be my superpower. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=430.88s)]
*  I think we'd be able to get in here. No, I think my superpower. Hold on a second. I do need to take [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=436.15999999999997s)]

*  But yeah, my superpower. I think mine would be if you went into the bathroom, not being able to know [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=456.71999999999997s)]
*  if somebody had pooped in there recently. That would be nice. It was like when you take a dump, [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=462.08s)]
*  it doesn't smell if you had that for everybody. But it's like the second you walk into a bathroom, [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=468.4s)]
*  you can tell if somebody dumped recently, if somebody with perfume did dump. Oh, you want to [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=472.32s)]
*  know if they dumped or not know? I don't want to not know. I don't want to know anything. So [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=477.04s)]
*  that'd be my superpower to not have, because you can't trick your mind and not know. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=480.16s)]
*  If the seat's warm, you're going to be like, that's the worst. And you sit down at an airport [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=486.64000000000004s)]
*  bathroom and the seat's 98.6 degrees and you're like, fuck, dude. Yeah, fuck, man. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=490.56s)]
*  Bro, and some people do dumps right onto, they won't even flush the toilet at an airport or [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=496.64000000000004s)]
*  whatever. They'll do dumps right on the pee. I actually, I've come around, I shit on planes now. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=501.68s)]
*  No, you have to, because otherwise you're going to fart like a coward and stink the whole plane up. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=507.52000000000004s)]
*  So now I do the valiant thing. I like walk by everyone. I sit down there for like 15 minutes [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=511.52000000000004s)]
*  and they all know, they all know what I did. Do you take a newspaper? I will take my book. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=516.24s)]
*  If I'm reading a book, I'll take a book with me and I'll just, I'm trying to get this, they got to [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=522.32s)]
*  just get rid of the stigma because it's like, dude, otherwise you're just going to fart silently [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=526.4s)]
*  and just ruin the whole flight. Yeah. Which I also do sometimes. But it's like, I now I'm like, no, [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=530.32s)]
*  this is juvenile. I got to go like a man and shit on this plane. I'll be back in a little bit. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=534.96s)]
*  Right next from the stewardess. Yeah, I'll be back. Do you tell, yeah, that's crazy. If you tell the [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=539.6s)]

*  before. Like I've taken like a strong weed edible and you have to take a dump in the middle of it. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=770.64s)]
*  And it's just like, it's the worst. I think it's the worst part of it. Oh, that seems crazy. It's [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=774.32s)]
*  very wretched. Yeah. You get like very much like kind of like, you know, you feel like an animal [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=779.12s)]
*  and you're like, what am I doing? Yeah. Taking a gross shit and you're high. It's not good. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=783.12s)]
*  That makes me sad. Yeah, it is. It literally just makes you sad. You're like high. You think [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=787.44s)]
*  everything's cool. Then you take disgusting shit. Well, imagine, yeah. Say if you, some people used [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=791.2s)]
*  to get their pets higher or whatever, you know, and then watching your dog, like my buddies, uh, [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=795.36s)]
*  it would get his dog high, I guess. I think this is when it was legal or something. Yeah. And he [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=799.76s)]
*  would get it high and then it would start to poop and it would fall over. It would just, it couldn't [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=803.76s)]
*  even, um, it fucks your legs up. Yeah. When dogs eat weed, it fucks their legs up. They eat [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=808.24s)]
*  mushrooms. They're sharp as tacks. Really? Yeah. My inadvertently, my dog ate a little bit of [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=812.88s)]
*  mushrooms one time. No problem. Yeah. Wow. In Austin? No, this was back in Philly. He ate a [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=817.84s)]
*  little bit of weed one time and he was, he couldn't walk. Yeah. I just had to hold him and just, you [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=822.72s)]
*  know, we spent like, we just like watched a movie. I watched the movie and just held him. Oh, that's [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=828.24s)]
*  cool. Weed is not good for dogs. Mushrooms, I would argue. Yeah. He was chilling. And it would be great [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=831.68s)]
*  to see if dogs started using shrooms or whatever, just to see how they kind of started to put new [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=837.12s)]
*  things together. That would be pretty fascinating. Dude, I will say he was kind of more well-behaved. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=841.36s)]
*  I could just be me, but he like never listened. And he inadvertently, it was like an accident. I [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=846.48s)]
*  had like, I made like, put something in like a little tea bag and I threw it in the trash and [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=850.48s)]
*  he just ate the tea bag. Yeah. I was like, shit. And he, I just let him outside and he just zoomed [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=854.48s)]
*  around and went back in. I was like, all right. That's pretty cool. How, how do dogs do on [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=858.3199999999999s)]
*  mushrooms? Can we bring that up actually? I can't believe this isn't a huge study or something. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=861.92s)]
*  Weed, they get into edibles all the time. That is like for real a problem. Yeah. There's always [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=866.72s)]
*  that stone kid in your high school. We use that laser and he's like, yeah, yeah. Yeah. It's really, [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=871.2s)]
*  once you like, yeah, it's okay. That's toxic. Funny doggy psychoactive shrooms. There you go. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=875.5200000000001s)]
*  This guy looks like he's struggling. This guy looks like he's not having a good time. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=882.96s)]
*  Whoa, bro. He might've done a heroic dose. This little mixed felt like, wow, bro. Dude, [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=886.8000000000001s)]
*  that's like your marriage, dude. Shortly after this, I rushed him to the vet. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=893.6s)]
*  Oh my God. What was that? It was Roxy had found wild shrooms growing. This guy's such a liar. No, [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=899.28s)]
*  they didn't. Yeah. How the fuck did the vet realize that? [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=904.64s)]
*  There he goes. Wow, bro. Oh no. Super attentive. See, my dog was, my dog might have microdosed [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=911.6s)]
*  though. So maybe it was just more kind of chilling. This person filming him. That's so wicked. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=920.0s)]
*  She didn't seem afraid. She seemed to be enjoying the experience. All right. I mean, maybe so. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=925.5999999999999s)]
*  But this kind of shows you if humans start, like some people say that there's the stone [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=934.4s)]
*  date theory or whatever, you know, that if that humans ate that apes ate mushrooms and that's how [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=938.4s)]
*  we eventually evolved, you could start to see it with this dog. Like, yeah, this dog is onto something. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=943.12s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. Dude, I think there was something to that though. The stone date theory. I don't think [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=949.52s)]
*  it's that crazy because our brain size, like, I don't know if it like doubled. It like grew very [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=953.2s)]
*  quickly out of nowhere. Did it really? Yeah. Back in like day, our brains were like smaller than out [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=958.72s)]
*  of nowhere. They were just and they fattened in it. They don't know why it happened. Really? No idea. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=963.5200000000001s)]
*  I guess they looked at like skull sizes and they're like, let's see it. Yes. Something happened where [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=968.6400000000001s)]
*  our brains just went nuts. According to current understanding, the human brain roughly doubled in [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=973.2s)]
*  size over a period of around two million years. There we go. With the most rapid expansion happening [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=977.9200000000001s)]
*  between eight hundred thousand and two hundred thousand years ago, marking a significant brain boom. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=982.08s)]
*  I think dogs have been around forever. Are there great? Are their brains growing too? [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=987.36s)]
*  Or like the great question. Have dogs brains evolved? Human brains have tripled in size [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=990.5600000000001s)]
*  since the beginning of the human family tree, which dates back around seven million years ago. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=997.44s)]
*  Wow. So our brains are getting bigger. See, this for me ties straight into like believing. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=1001.84s)]
*  If you look at an alien, right, usual picture of an alien, it's this body that has no definition. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=1006.48s)]
*  Huge head. Exactly. It's like that's all eventually. That's what we'll turn into. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=1011.52s)]
*  We are. It's like this. You don't need to use any muscle. Everything's there. Just machine comes [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=1015.5999999999999s)]
*  into your body through a tube leaves out. You don't have to poop three times a week or day. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=1020.4s)]
*  And on weekends, probably they're probably pretty regular, though. Aliens. No, definitely. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=1026.48s)]
*  It's like, you know, sloths shit like once a month. No way. Come down from the tree and they just shit [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=1031.92s)]
*  every 30 days, like an enormous pile of shit. Must take an hour. Bring it up. Takes a while. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=1037.04s)]
*  It's pretty funny. They come down real slow. Once a week, my bad, my bad. So she's used to [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=1042.4s)]
*  once a week. Now that makes sense. Daily women sloths daily when they're in heat. I must be in [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=1048.8s)]
*  heat there. That's why I'm dumping all the time. So damn horny. Because I wonder if there's a [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=1053.3600000000001s)]
*  there's like. Yeah, I wonder if there's if your body wants to have poop in it or doesn't probably [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=1059.04s)]
*  doesn't. Yeah, I would say not. I would say it doesn't. It's I mean, it's you feel so much better [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=1067.76s)]
*  when you don't have it in you. How does it feel? So the fact that you do that every couple of days, [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=1072.48s)]
*  is that kind of like beating off where it feels great? Like if you hold it in for three days? [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=1076.6399999999999s)]
*  Well, it definitely feels more like an organized crime, you know? Really? Yeah, it's like more. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=1080.8s)]
*  It's just not you're not just fucking showing up. It's not like it's like just spraying bullets. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=1086.6399999999999s)]
*  It feels like you just got that fucking John Wilkes poop. You know, you fucking rolled up [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=1092.48s)]
*  with one fucking purpose. So it's just like you'll bam. Very organized, very Japanese almost. Really? [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=1097.84s)]

*  Not somebody the second they get a bullet in the gun. They just like not like as soon as you wake [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=1113.76s)]
*  up every day. Yeah, they just spray it at the neighbors. I will say waking up in the middle [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=1117.92s)]

*  that's such a nightmare to navigate. It seems like, cause then it's like, you have two different [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=1778.48s)]
*  houses, you know, and I know myself, I'd make my house more fun than hers. So you can start doing [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=1781.76s)]
*  that shit. And it's like, yeah, getting big speakers and shit. It'd be so nasty, dude. But [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=1786.08s)]
*  it's also like, yeah, it's, it's just hard. Like, yeah, I think, what is it? Like 40, I think [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=1790.08s)]

*  not great. And it takes a lot when you get input on those things. It's so easy to be like, [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=1861.04s)]
*  fuck you, shut up. You don't know what you're talking about, but over time it can almost like [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=1867.1200000000001s)]
*  give you insight into the aspects of yourself that you're like, yeah, I could probably change [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=1872.96s)]
*  this a little bit. Or even in like the heat of arguments, I'll hear something she'll say. And in [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=1877.2s)]
*  my head, I'll, before I even have time, I'll be like, fuck that, that's bullshit. Then there'll [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=1881.52s)]
*  be a part of my brain where like, fuck, that's kind of valid, but I'll be like, fuck this, [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=1885.2s)]

*  you know, so it's just like learning how to communicate. And in order to communicate, [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=1896.32s)]
*  you got to take in a lot of like kind of bad stuff about yourself without like completely [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=1899.76s)]
*  just getting floored to level 10, which you don't even realize is happening. Right. That makes sense. [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=1904.24s)]

*  like take perspective. All right. That's valid. And it just like, it literally feels like you're [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=1926.0s)]
*  moving like an 800 pound stone to just be like, all right, maybe that is something annoying. I do. [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=1930.96s)]
*  Maybe that is a personal weakness of mine. It's just fucking hard, but you learn how to do it. [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=1935.6000000000001s)]

*  conversations like about that kind of stuff all the time. You have to talk about that kind of stuff [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=1951.12s)]
*  all the time. And it's like, how do we, how should we parent? Yeah. Wow. That's cool though. [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=1954.08s)]

*  If you got to do that, it's already over. And it's like, I think it's great. Is it, it enters a, [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=2076.48s)]
*  it's the best thing when you're arguing, it's like, I'm the boss, I'm the boss. And you just clash, [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=2081.2s)]
*  you give the authority to another figure. And then it's like, when you do couples counseling, [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=2085.04s)]
*  if your wife's right, it gets to like, kind of instead of like hitting you like a laser beam, [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=2090.64s)]
*  it goes to that person. They kind of can relate. It's like the, I don't know how to explain it, [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=2094.24s)]

*  like, it just helps because it's like, you don't want to hear it from the other person. You know [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=2110.72s)]
*  what I mean? Like if, like my wife's telling me something, I'm like, I don't want to hear the shit. [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=2114.48s)]
*  If she tells him that he tells me, I'm like, that is actually a fantastic point. Yeah. And I'm not [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=2117.52s)]
*  trying to be a dick. It just works. I mean, people have to, how do you bridge a topic? Say there's [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=2121.7599999999998s)]
*  something you want to talk to your wife about. How do you kind of do it? Dude. So I've learned [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=2128.0s)]
*  before I would just boil quietly and then like explode. Now what I do, I'll wait. Like violent [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=2132.88s)]
*  Irish, like the Irish hello. Exactly. Exactly. Yeah. Exactly. Another thing. What I do now, [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=2138.96s)]
*  freckles of flying across. There's bouncing off each other. Yeah. The, well, the problem is it's [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=2147.2s)]
*  like, all right, I have a piece of information. If I relate to this person, they're going to have a [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=2154.3199999999997s)]
*  big emotional reaction. That's going to get me all upset. So I'll just keep it to myself. [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=2157.6s)]
*  And so eventually what I learned to do is be like, I got to tell you something. Then this is actually [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=2162.08s)]
*  going to, this could potentially get you upset. So like that way they're, they're not caught off guard. [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=2166.56s)]
*  They're like, that catches them. And they're like, all right, they have time to prepare themselves. [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=2170.8799999999997s)]
*  And then you hit them with the information rather than this being like, yeah, that really fucking [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=2174.3999999999996s)]
*  bothered me the like three days ago. And that, you know, they're just like, what the fuck is this? [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=2178.3199999999997s)]
*  So I, you have to like, for me, it's like, I have to preface the fact that I'm about to bring up [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=2181.2s)]

*  school. A lot of the women there secretly had like deeply conservative husbands who worked as like [[00:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=3421.6800000000003s)]

*  But some of them, it's just not practical. It's like, like I have friends that like, [[00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=3441.52s)]

*  there weren't. Right. But that has to go away quickly. Yeah. Because there are people shooting [[00:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=3484.16s)]

*  about that. It was a lot of listening and learning. Was it a lot of stuff? Yeah. We, we, but we worked [[01:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=3699.52s)]

*  chain of command, right? And then also how we're advancing as in our worldviews are doing the same [[01:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=3738.4s)]
*  thing where we had like, you know, like medieval rulers and the democracies. And then the libs are [[01:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=3742.64s)]
*  the leading edge of cultural evolution where it's like everything's being more and more inclusive [[01:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=3747.36s)]
*  physically and worldviewly, you know, in terms of worldview, just the libs lost the plot or the, [[01:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=3751.76s)]

*  It's a good point. Actually. I think a lot of people did. I mean, I don't know, dude, I was a [[01:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=3771.52s)]
*  Democrat. I mean, like I got so angry when they did that stuff to Bernie, you know, like my dad [[01:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=3776.24s)]
*  was an old man. So I, to me, it also registered like somebody taking advantage of an older person. [[01:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=3782.48s)]
*  Yeah. That shit, like at that point for me, I was just like, what's going on here. And then I am [[01:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=3788.0s)]
*  super concerned about like the big pharma and medicine just using us all and not caring that [[01:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=3794.3199999999997s)]
*  we're human beings. Like, yes, there's a lot of medicine that's helping people, but also like [[01:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=3803.04s)]
*  everybody shouldn't be on a, on a medicine. Yeah. You know, and there's some commercials for medicines. [[01:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=3806.4799999999996s)]
*  They don't even say what it does. Then you look it up and it's like, it's for like heart failure [[01:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=3811.3599999999997s)]
*  and you're like, why the fuck you, this is a baseball game, dude. I'm not going to beg you. [[01:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=3817.2s)]
*  Can I get that heart failure medication? Yeah. You have to request it. The wheelchair gum or [[01:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=3819.92s)]
*  whatever. There's all kinds of shit. And you're like, what would you need that for? Yeah. But [[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=3824.1600000000003s)]
*  yeah, that's, that's the, that's the big standoff right now. It's like, so I liked RFK. He was kind [[01:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=3828.6400000000003s)]
*  of the guy that I thought was neat. Me too. I'm been to him. I like the fact that he's doing all [[01:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=3832.4s)]
*  that stuff against all those things. And then I think, I don't think we have the same parties. [[01:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=3836.1600000000003s)]
*  I don't feel like it's Democrats and Republicans anymore. There's something else happening. Yeah. [[01:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=3840.32s)]
*  And it's going to keep morphing. Well, that's the Wilbur stuff is that the green, it was like, [[01:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=3844.1600000000003s)]
*  orange is like the business science wave. And the green wave was the one that's like, [[01:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=3848.7999999999997s)]
*  in terms of worldviews, you can have like, what he called red was like ethnocentric. That was what [[01:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=3852.4s)]
*  he called Trump. It's like, it's things that speak to like ethnocentric ideals, where people [[01:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=3856.64s)]
*  get to the point where they can only recognize like people that look like them. They can only [[01:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=3860.88s)]
*  care about people who look like them, which is like a reality for a lot of people all across [[01:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=3864.48s)]
*  the world. It's like, you know, every country and every country is like, we have the best food. We [[01:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=3868.4s)]
*  have the most beautiful, everybody does this. And then his whole theory is that you slowly grow out [[01:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=3872.56s)]
*  of it to more complex and inclusive worldviews. But it was again, it was like that the thing that [[01:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=3876.72s)]
*  crushed like the like the with Jordan Peterson, Jordan Peterson, Jordan Peterson, Jordan Peterson, [[01:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=3881.68s)]
*  Jesus Christ, his whole thing we call like postmodern neo Marxism is that green wave Ken [[01:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=3888.9599999999996s)]
*  Wilbur talks about where it's like the leading edge where all the colleges are like radical [[01:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=3894.0s)]
*  inclusivity. But all they have to do is go Trump guys, you're cool too. It's all they have to do. [[01:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=3896.9599999999996s)]
*  They can't do it. And now the whole thing is just imploding on itself. [[01:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=3902.64s)]
*  So that's what that makes you start to think. Do they just hate like white men? For me, it's like [[01:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=3905.8399999999997s)]
*  in three generations, it's like I always say like beige power, like everybody's gonna be beige, [[01:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=3913.04s)]
*  right? Three generations, everybody's gonna be like, you know, Ben Simmons, Blake Griffin, [[01:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=3916.64s)]
*  you know, penguin people, you know, mixed. Yeah. And so it's just kind of weird. How do we want [[01:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=3922.08s)]
*  to operate that in the meantime? Right. Exactly. But then I think when people get scared, [[01:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=3928.4s)]
*  especially with like threats of war, fears, they start to they want to gravitate towards whatever [[01:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=3933.76s)]
*  is there seems like their people. Prison prison is the same thing. You go to prison, everyone's [[01:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=3939.52s)]
*  base, you know, it's all like based on race and all that stuff. Yeah. And then but but everybody [[01:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=3944.08s)]

*  It's tough when there's a winner and a loser. I was in the grocery store the day of I guess like [[01:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=4361.2s)]
*  that. You got elected that night and then, you know, in the three in the morning or whatever. [[01:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=4366.96s)]

*  It just shows you that it's must there. But also then if that's the safe. Okay. They spend [[01:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=4399.92s)]
*  that much on a campaign, right? Both these sides spend a ton of money. But if the if there's just [[01:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=4404.96s)]
*  like these powers in the background doing thing, it's just like why would they if it's not even [[01:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=4410.080000000001s)]
*  real say the office isn't even, you know, it's just for show. Sure. It just seems like you [[01:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=4414.96s)]

*  dollars on building a set for her appearance on Call Her Daddy. Like, dude, why here is the [[01:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=4458.64s)]

*  I think, a host to come to her. So I think she didn't want to go anywhere. So she built the set. [[01:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=4467.76s)]
*  But I wonder if she has that's such a I mean, you know, that's just kind of weird. It's like, [[01:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=4472.56s)]

*  too much. But it's like now they can't go on with the sound buddy little things. They have to go sit [[01:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=4802.08s)]
*  down and like answer actual questions. And people now like I didn't know. I couldn't tell what [[01:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=4806.639999999999s)]

*  here's the whole thing. Yeah. So now you have to be able to sit down and actually communicate [[01:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=4819.2s)]
*  rather than like hitting talking points and like engineering, you know, people's ideas on things. [[01:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=4822.8s)]
*  Do you think that Rogan's endorsement helped Trump win or do you think it had any effect? [[01:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=4827.360000000001s)]

*  least a two hour conversation. Yeah, because really what he did over the past years is just [[01:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=4844.96s)]

*  like if they're not making sense and you know, he's pretty adamant about the guy. I don't get that. [[01:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=4861.28s)]
*  That doesn't make sense. You know, I'm a weak interviewer. Okay. I think it won't make sense. [[01:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=4866.320000000001s)]

*  Yeah. I will say this though. I think the person that won that election, I think the person that [[01:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=5034.24s)]
*  changed it was Dana White. Really? Undeniably. That's why do you think that? Because he got [[01:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=5039.36s)]
*  Trump in the podcasts. He made it happen. He, he did it. Yeah. He is just, you, he did that. [[01:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=5046.0s)]
*  Yeah. That makes sense. He was the one being like, you got to do these. He's the one who like talked [[01:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=5057.84s)]
*  to Joe about it for years. It's been in discussion. I don't think Joe Rogan was going to do that. And [[01:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=5063.2s)]
*  then he did, you know, and that put, I did kind of push it. I think that helped actually. Yeah. Dana [[01:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=5068.32s)]
*  made all that happen. Dude. It got like, that was the thing too. It was like just you, if you want [[01:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=5074.8s)]
*  to look at YouTube views, that's kind of like, I don't know if that like works with polling, but [[01:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=5078.8s)]
*  it's like the Rogan Trump episode, I don't, what is it at? Like 30 million. It was, it was at like [[01:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=5082.4s)]
*  millions quickly. The call, call me daddy or whatever that podcast with Kamala was like, [[01:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=5088.08s)]
*  I don't know if it hit a million. It did. I think it might have 47 million, 47 million. If you look [[01:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=5094.48s)]
*  up the call her daddy or call him daddy or whatever, call me daddy. Excuse me. Um, I'll call her daddy. [[01:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=5099.679999999999s)]
*  There you go. It got 812,000, 812,000. But that's just a clip. Now here's the problem. [[01:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=5104.879999999999s)]
*  Not bragging my YouTube specialty better. But that's what I'm saying. That's, that is a gauge [[01:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=5112.48s)]
*  of public interest and it's like public interest in my opinion, probably translates to voting. I [[01:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=5118.96s)]
*  think, I don't know. Or at least people come into experience the person, you know, true. Um, yeah, [[01:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=5123.759999999999s)]
*  definitely interesting. You can't watch the full episodes because they're on Sirius. Is that right? [[01:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=5129.599999999999s)]
*  Sirius? Yeah, they only put a clip. Yeah. So you can't see the full episodes of these podcasts [[01:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=5135.28s)]
*  either. So you don't know, um, what really, you know, I wish you the best. I'm not like, yeah, [[01:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=5141.68s)]
*  that's the thing. I'm not like, I fucking hate that lady. I'm like, I felt sad. I didn't, I personally [[01:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=5146.56s)]
*  didn't really want her to win because I was just like, you know, I think Trump will probably maybe [[01:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=5151.200000000001s)]
*  stop the wars faster. That's my hope. Well, I just, I don't know. I just, I don't know what's happening. [[01:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=5156.08s)]
*  I feel like there's a changing of these parties because you have former Democrats who are now [[01:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=5162.0s)]
*  Republicans, but they'd also don't even get along with half of the people in office. Yeah. People are [[01:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=5167.360000000001s)]
*  sick of politicians overall. Big time. Um, APAC and lobbyists like have infiltrated what it seems [[01:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=5173.4400000000005s)]
*  like politics overall. It's like for sure. And people, you can't hide the information from people [[01:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=5182.4800000000005s)]
*  anymore. Yeah. Well, dude, the weird thing was, is like, they started like the, the Democrats started [[01:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=5187.52s)]
*  being like, I mean, George Bush was great and like, you know, Cheney and all that stuff. And it's [[01:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=5193.52s)]
*  like, why, why are they pumped on them? That was, that to me was just weird where it's like, they're [[01:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=5198.0s)]
*  all dark. And then I think at the last minute they started being like, yeah, we actually won strong [[01:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=5202.080000000001s)]
*  borders and all that stuff too. Just cause they were like, this is working. So, you know, it's, [[01:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=5206.320000000001s)]
*  I think it's all part of a bigger process. That is for the best where it's like, like you were saying, [[01:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=5210.72s)]
*  the Republican party is totally different, like way different from remember like 1995. [[01:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=5214.8s)]
*  It was like, it was, it was like send people to jail for fucking, you know, 30 years for crack and [[01:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=5219.92s)]
*  all this stuff. And now it's like, we should get some of these guys out of prison, you know, [[01:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=5225.04s)]
*  which everyone's doing now, but that's cause of like a liberal worldview. And that's been kind of, [[01:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=5228.48s)]
*  they got to get a couple more brothers in the party too. I think, oh, it's common, dude. I [[01:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=5232.48s)]
*  think it's common. But here's the thing too. It's like, so you have like the liberal people have [[01:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=5236.08s)]
*  been like, yeah, we shouldn't send people to jail for having crack on them for 40 fucking years. And [[01:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=5239.44s)]
*  then you're like, yeah, that's a good idea. But then with the immigration thing, it's like, [[01:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=5242.96s)]
*  I personally have no problem with immigrants, but it's like, you can only have so many, like that's [[01:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=5246.879999999999s)]
*  a reality. Right. It's just, you're having a party. You can't invite the whole city to your party. [[01:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=5251.599999999999s)]
*  It won't work. So the same thing happens with the border. And it's a shame because people want to [[01:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=5256.32s)]
*  escape, like, you know, crushing poverty, but the Republicans are right in that you can't like, [[01:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=5260.32s)]
*  and it's like, if you're like just thinking on a human level, you're like, I don't want to like [[01:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=5265.599999999999s)]
*  kick some guy out or have some guy come against the wall and be like, get the fuck back. But you do [[01:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=5268.32s)]
*  have to do that. But you also, I think there's ways you can do it in an organized pattern. [[01:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=5273.76s)]
*  Yeah, true. So you're properly vetting people. And then they used to have a system where [[01:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=5278.320000000001s)]
*  people could serve. They could, you could almost adopt a homeless person or whatever who came [[01:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=5283.2s)]
*  across the border and you were their sponsor. That's cool. I'm super cool. So then you as a [[01:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=5287.92s)]
*  member of your country, right. Or that you were born into. Sure. It's a blessing, right. [[01:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=5293.12s)]
*  Easy for us to say that. But then you get to be part of the of immigrate. You know, it's like [[01:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=5297.52s)]
*  there's an actual connection there. So, you know, I don't know. That's a good, I like that idea, [[01:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=5304.400000000001s)]
*  though. It's easy to say stuff. Let's change the topic. What else can we talk about? But I was [[01:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=5309.4400000000005s)]
*  saying, too, then you can kind of like set them up and like contest against each other. Oh, yeah. [[01:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=5313.52s)]
*  Well, people have had that. I've heard that material before. I think of like doing like a [[01:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=5318.96s)]
*  American Ninja Warrior to come over the border. That would be nice too. Yeah. I was saying if [[01:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=5323.4400000000005s)]
*  you had like if I adopted a guy, you adopted a guy, we could kind of make them compete. Yeah. [[01:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=5327.04s)]
*  Like battle. For the glory of our houses. Yeah. Yeah. That'd be so sick. That would be awesome. [[01:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=5331.84s)]
*  And like a fun way. You know what I mean? Totally. And you raise money for helping people that are [[01:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=5337.92s)]
*  coming over. Exactly. Fuck. Winner's family comes over. Yeah. Loser's family pays. That'd be a great. [[01:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=5343.5199999999995s)]
*  Dude, I had this idea for a game show, right. So check this out. It's you get two like kind of [[01:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=5350.4s)]
*  lifeguard chairs, right. And you have you put like kind of cellophane, like kind of like some light [[01:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=5354.16s)]
*  blue plastic around. You can still see through it. And at the bottom of the at the bottom is a scale, [[01:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=5362.5599999999995s)]
*  right. And you get two guys who have eaten for like a week, haven't gone to the bathroom. [[01:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=5370.08s)]
*  Whoever can do the most poop at, you know, given amount of time wins a car or something, [[01:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=5376.0s)]
*  maybe not a car, maybe a motorcycle. That's an awesome game. So you're inside the lifeguard [[01:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=5383.6s)]
*  chair. You're wrapped in blue. What's the blue wrapping just to kind of see it? You don't want [[01:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=5388.88s)]
*  to see that on both people out. But if you see the scale going up or something, it'll at least excite [[01:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=5393.200000000001s)]
*  people. You don't think the viewers at home are going to see the pile? I think you want to be able [[01:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=5397.6s)]
*  to see it. You want to see it vague. So you want it to be like opaque. Like, yeah, I see. [[01:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=5401.280000000001s)]
*  Just like a general shape. Yeah. Have like a like a frosted glass over. Yes. That's what I mean. [[01:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=5406.72s)]
*  Frosted glass. That would be nice. Yeah, that's a great show. Thanks, man. That is a fantastic show. [[01:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=5411.28s)]
*  On to the scale would be nice. I recently just did a thing where you you have to poop at home [[01:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=5416.639999999999s)]
*  and then like scoop it and mail it to get like results to see like what they think of you. [[01:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=5421.2s)]
*  What are you talking about? You can do that. You can mail it to a scientist. You're a science teacher. [[01:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=5424.32s)]
*  You can send it to a scientist. Oh, my God, bro. This is incredible. You've been fucking [[01:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=5434.639999999999s)]
*  compromised. You're mailing poop of your own. I did. Yeah. I want to see it with my micro. Dude, [[01:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=5439.68s)]
*  that was the thing. I thought you did a whole turd. You they like give you a like a thing to [[01:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=5446.240000000001s)]
*  put on your toilet paper or they put a thing on your toilet. It's like a paper thing that sticks [[01:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=5452.240000000001s)]
*  and it has like a little like, you know, like the dick part of your boxers. Yeah, it has like that. [[01:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=5456.320000000001s)]
*  But for a turd. So there's this thing. Yeah, it's like that. And then it catches it. And then you [[01:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=5460.240000000001s)]
*  have to like scoop. I thought you just pick the turd up and put it in a jar. But no, you [[01:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=5465.12s)]
*  scoop like the smallest amount and then you put it in like shake it up in a solution. And then [[01:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=5469.28s)]
*  they just tell you like what's up with your microbiome. Tell you like if they think you're [[01:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=5475.36s)]
*  chill or not. That was what it was. It was that one. What if he told you where your stepdad lives? [[01:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=5479.2s)]
*  We'll tell you. Yeah, I don't know, man. I also think a lot of this stuff, too. [[01:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=5484.88s)]
*  After doing it, I think it's just a way for companies to sell you vitamins because they [[01:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=5489.36s)]
*  can be based on this. We recommend X, Y and Z. And once you once you you'll you almost want to buy it [[01:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=5493.04s)]
*  so they don't tell anybody about your poop. I feel like you'd be like, don't tell anybody about poop. [[01:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=5498.96s)]
*  True. How about the vitamins? [[01:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=5502.0s)]

*  the same time. And my test was run first. I kept telling her that they opened her vial and shut [[01:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=5512.96s)]
*  down the lab. I was like, yeah, the whole place had to evacuate. They sent me an email. So they [[01:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=5518.56s)]
*  opened yours. That's love, dude. That's a fun. That's a fun one. That's a good thing about [[01:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=5523.84s)]

*  Yeah. That's like jumping over the broom or whatever. But in some cultures. Yeah, exactly. [[01:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=5537.52s)]
*  Wow, dude. I was talking about medicine. Yeah, I think so. We got off the politics stuff. So [[01:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=5543.68s)]
*  we're all probably should have. People feel like people are over it. But that's also it's like, [[01:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=5550.16s)]
*  oh, what was I going to ask you? Do you think? Oh, look at this. Is this like a new slave or [[01:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=5554.8s)]
*  whatever? Oh, this is like the Tesla thing, bro. Wow. Yeah, dude. I don't know. Elon rolled out [[01:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=5560.639999999999s)]

*  Do you Tesla Tesla or Musk? Oh, boy. I would like a little robo lawnmower, though, I'll be honest. [[01:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=5582.32s)]

*  They shouldn't give them like legs and arms and shit. Yeah, you're right. Actually, well, you [[01:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=5594.88s)]
*  won't need these guys looking like people because then somebody is going to start fucking them. I [[01:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=5598.4s)]
*  mean, it's already happened, I'm sure. I like the way I think it's kind of savage. But then your kid [[01:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=5602.24s)]
*  will like you're like, oh, the yard, you can't look at what you want. Yeah, that's true. Actually, [[01:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=5608.0s)]

*  ridiculous. Dude, do you think it's weird? This is something that doesn't get talked about a lot is [[01:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=5619.04s)]
*  like, where do step dads go when the divorce happens? You know, because they kind of don't [[01:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=5623.679999999999s)]
*  get to see the kids anymore. You know, I didn't think about that. You're saying when you get, oh, [[01:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=5628.72s)]
*  you divorce and you get divorced, you basically break up with the stepdad. I think they go back [[01:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=5632.56s)]
*  to the apartment, dude. They straight to an apartment complex that has a pool at it. Yeah. [[01:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=5636.8s)]

*  like a black limousine takes a bag and they just wait and queue to be stepdads. It's kind of crazy. [[01:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=5645.52s)]
*  You never think about that because the stepdad gets involved in a kid's life for a couple years [[01:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=5651.92s)]
*  for better or for worse. Yeah. But then they have to just [[01:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=5655.68s)]

*  depends. I feel like if you knew the kid from when it was a baby, you should or just keep the phone [[01:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=5666.240000000001s)]

*  got to be feel weird. Yeah, eventually. Or if there's a new stepdad, you can't be like, [[01:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=5677.200000000001s)]
*  hey, you got to pass the baton and be like, it's a good boy. But do those stepdads meet somewhere and [[01:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=5681.76s)]
*  like have a date? They meet at Sabaro. They meet at Sabaro and they ceremoniously split a piece. [[01:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=5686.08s)]
*  The guy gives the new stepdad the like the fifth slice and he only has three. Hey, what's up? I'm [[01:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=5695.360000000001s)]

*  Exactly. I kind of wish I was able to experience it a little bit, honestly. Yeah. But, you know, [[01:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=5708.639999999999s)]
*  for real, I was always I always assumed that was just like how it would go for me. I was like, [[01:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=5713.92s)]
*  yeah, I'll just kind of kick around and eventually I'll just date a chick with kids and be a stepdad. [[01:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=5718.719999999999s)]
*  But it didn't work out that way. So I honestly wouldn't have minded to be pretty sick. Yeah. [[01:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=5723.12s)]
*  Sometimes I have a dream maybe that I meet a lady and she already has a kid. Maybe. Yeah, man. Just [[01:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=5728.16s)]

*  man and he has and it's funny the other guys were like, do you not even know you're not even a black [[01:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=5756.48s)]
*  dad until you have three kids. That's hilarious. Like two kids for a black guy. That's nothing, [[01:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=5761.44s)]
*  bro. That's so funny. That's child's play. So now he's official. Yeah. Now he's really like, dang, [[01:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=5769.919999999999s)]

*  else in the news going on or anything else? Dude, I haven't even been fucking following news. I [[01:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=5787.2s)]
*  don't know what's going on. What else is going on with me? Do you know what I've been doing [[01:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=5791.5199999999995s)]
*  recently? I've been researching. So I've been reading autobiographies. That's my big kick right [[01:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=5795.679999999999s)]
*  now. Wow. I've just been trying to just study people's lives and see like at the end of their [[01:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=5800.08s)]
*  life, what did they think was good? What did they think was bad? I only got through like once. Well, [[01:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=5804.8s)]
*  I got through a couple actually, but dude, it's been cracking me up. Bertrand Russell was like [[01:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=5809.04s)]
*  this famous mathematician Bertram Russell Bertrand Russell. Yeah. He wrote him in like [[01:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=5815.04s)]
*  this guy Whitehead wrote this like big book called Principia Mathematica where they spent, [[01:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=5820.0s)]
*  I think like 200 pages proving one plus one equals two. This was like the type of stuff he was on. [[01:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=5824.88s)]
*  Wow. Bizarre. Why? Just because they find ways that you could not prove it. People are coming [[01:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=5830.24s)]
*  through and like underlie. So apparently math is like there's like a like a set of axioms that like [[01:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=5835.04s)]
*  you just have to assume is true. You know, they want math. There's a bunch of people back in the [[01:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=5841.28s)]
*  day who wanted math to be able to like totally explain everything in the universe. It's just [[01:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=5845.599999999999s)]
*  the way it is. But there is a aspect of faith in math where you have to believe the axioms. [[01:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=5849.2s)]
*  Right. So they were trying to just be like, check this out. And they just got real into one plus one [[01:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=5854.5599999999995s)]
*  in that book. But he's apparently like a genius. And I read his and I read the guy, you know, [[01:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=5859.44s)]
*  Angela's Ashes. Yeah, I read he has one called Tiz. That's his second Frank McCourt. So Angela's [[01:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=5865.6s)]
*  Ashes was his time in Ireland till he was 19. And then at 19, he moved to New York City in like the [[01:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=5872.88s)]
*  fifties. And he wrote another book called Tiz. That's from the 1950s to like whenever the fucking [[01:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=5877.6s)]
*  eighties or whatever. But I've been like, I was reading those both simultaneously and like, [[01:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=5882.96s)]
*  it's so funny how every male memoir is just a guy talking about how horny they were as a kid. It's [[01:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=5887.120000000001s)]
*  crazy. Well, some lady oven themselves at a Wal-Mart. You see that? No. Somebody wandered [[01:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=5893.12s)]
*  into an oven. They were doing it. Was it was it hiding? Go seek or what happened? [[01:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=5898.64s)]
*  We're pulling it up. But there was a woman got stuck in one of the industrial baking ovens at a [[01:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=5903.5199999999995s)]
*  Wal-Mart, I believe. And I believe she passed away. Right. Yeah. From the gas or she burned herself up [[01:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=5908.16s)]

*  good in there, bro. True. I mean, this is harrowing. Yeah, of course. But I'm saying that it is a fact [[01:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=5936.48s)]

*  to your head or like make you act different. And again, it's, it's embarrassing. It's like, dude, [[01:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=6299.04s)]
*  I was making two grand selling weed, but it's like, it was enough for me at such a young age to be [[01:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=6302.08s)]

*  help out and don't get too, you know, how'd you get wiped out? How'd you get wiped out? Just losing [[01:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=6329.92s)]
*  money in the mail. I got robbed at gunpoint. I got, I like had like a couple of stretches where [[01:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=6334.56s)]

*  gunpoint. I lost that. And then I mailed like, I think like $30,000 in the mail and that got snagged [[01:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=6342.96s)]
*  by the postal. Yeah, dude, that was scary. I like put 30 K in the mail. Yeah. Vacuum sealed it, [[01:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=6348.320000000001s)]
*  all that stuff. And what you can you just not legally move that much money? You're not allowed [[01:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=6355.6s)]
*  to mail money like that. No. And then what they do is they're like, come on in, like they are like, [[01:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=6359.84s)]
*  we'll talk to you. And it was like, I wasn't, my name wasn't on it. It was like, I tacked it on with [[01:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=6363.6s)]
*  my friend and the trick is you can be like, I was buying a car, you know, did you go in there? You [[01:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=6368.08s)]
*  wear a mustache? No, dude, I was like, I just called a wash. I'm not going to the fucking postal, [[01:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=6374.0s)]
*  you know, post-menu post general mass or whatever it is. Is there a chance to get it back? [[01:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=6378.320000000001s)]
*  If you can prove it's legit, they're going to be like, all right, where's your tax return? [[01:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=6382.96s)]
*  I was going to like, so it was like, you can't unless you had a legitimate, if I legitimately [[01:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=6385.68s)]
*  was doing it, I could be like, hey, here's what I'm doing. I need that back. But it's like, [[01:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=6390.72s)]
*  it's the last place you want to go in and be like, no, it was actually up to no good. [[01:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=6394.400000000001s)]
*  I bet it's sitting there, making you go in there and talk to them. [[01:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=6397.68s)]
*  Yeah, right. That's gone. Hey, oh my God. Yeah, they probably took it. [[01:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=6399.360000000001s)]
*  Are the postal workers? I would imagine the post or they, they maybe, [[01:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=6404.240000000001s)]
*  you know, they were like, here you go. But it's like, yeah, that was the big thing back then. [[01:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=6407.68s)]
*  It was just mailing weed. You would just get it to your house and write immediately, right, [[01:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=6410.56s)]
*  return to sender. Don't open it. Because what they do is either a guy, like a officer pretends [[01:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=6414.4800000000005s)]
*  to work for the USPS and they come and deliver it. And what they were doing first, which kind of [[01:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=6420.08s)]
*  fucked them up, they'd like open the box right now and you open it and be like, there'd be weed [[01:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=6424.88s)]
*  in there. And you could just go, I don't know, anyone can mail me anything. So they legally [[01:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=6427.84s)]
*  couldn't do anything. So what they started doing is they let you get the package. They wait like 10 [[01:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=6432.16s)]
*  minutes and then they come in because people usually get it and cut it right open. So you [[01:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=6436.0s)]
*  have to do is you write return to sender, leave it in the corner of the room, wait about like an hour [[01:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=6439.68s)]
*  and then you put it in your car and you drive towards the post office. So if they pull you [[01:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=6444.0s)]
*  over, you're like, but I don't even know what this is. I'm taking it to the post office. And if you [[01:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=6446.88s)]
*  just kind of do a couple of laps, someone's following you, go somewhere else and you cut it open. [[01:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=6449.6s)]
*  But it's like, that was the move because California would mail it over for just like pennies on it [[01:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=6452.72s)]
*  compared to what it was on the East Coast. I thought I was the man, but then, you know, [[01:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=6456.88s)]
*  did you start buying anything? You buy a nice suit or something? I was very, very, I was like a Chinese [[01:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=6460.88s)]
*  triad. I would just, no, I didn't spend anything. I would like, would you start sleeping on your back [[01:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=6465.360000000001s)]
*  or something at least? You know what I would do? I would go on trips. I would do vacations. So I would [[01:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=6469.6s)]
*  go away and like ball out like that. But no, I didn't buy cars. I didn't do any of that stuff. [[01:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=6475.12s)]
*  I kept it pretty low key. Where'd you go to Cancun or something? Yeah, I went to Hawaii. [[01:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=6480.72s)]
*  I did a trip to Hawaii, to the Four Seasons. It was pretty tight. Damn, so you were balling. [[01:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=6485.44s)]
*  I was balling out. Yeah, I was balling. But then again, I lost it all. And then you go from like, [[01:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=6489.12s)]
*  you know, enjoying the perks of that to like, I'd be happy if someone gave me 50 bucks right now, [[01:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=6493.92s)]
*  you know? So it's like, yeah. And at a young age, it's the best thing that could have happened [[01:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=6498.56s)]
*  because at a young age, I got to like get that ego swell and just completely come. And there's [[01:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=6502.08s)]
*  something liberating when it happens. I remember being oddly like relieved at the time being like, [[01:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=6506.72s)]
*  oh, this is kind of cool. I don't have to worry about all this shit anymore. Oh, that's just a [[01:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN_sp5onvFc&t=6512.08s)]
