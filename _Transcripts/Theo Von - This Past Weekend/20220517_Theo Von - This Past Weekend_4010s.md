# Maui Milkshake  This Past Weekend w Theo Von #393
**Theo Von - This Past Weekend:** [May 17, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM)
*  I like this one. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=0.0s)]
*  Whenever you're down, out in the cold, faithless and die, your story's untold. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=6.0s)]
*  Come take my hand and walk there with me. I know a place where we can be free. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=20.0s)]
*  There is a light shining for you, guiding your way, helping you through. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=32.0s)]
*  Shadows and gloom are all that you see. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=44.0s)]
*  When fire bleeds, where we can be free. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=49.0s)]
*  There is a light. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=55.0s)]
*  And that, yeah, that is, uh, There Is A Light. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=58.0s)]
*  We played it a month ago on there, right around Easter. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=62.0s)]
*  On that belated bunny episode, we played that There Is A Light by Stone Keepers, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=66.0s)]
*  featuring David Manwe. Manu-Manueye. Manwe. Manueye. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=73.0s)]
*  Something. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=80.0s)]
*  Yeah, look, hey, hey, hey, hey. It's, uh, middle of May. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=84.0s)]
*  And, um, a lot going on in the world. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=90.0s)]
*  It's springtime, baby, you know, you could hear the bees in the distance. They're out there. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=94.0s)]
*  They out there honey hunting them bees, baby. You can hear them. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=99.0s)]
*  You can hear that buzz, baby. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=102.0s)]
*  You can hear just Mother Nature just trying to just, just trying to skeet all over the place, you know, it just, [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=105.0s)]
*  it's pretty romantic, actually, if you fall asleep, put your ear by the window before you go to bed. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=114.0s)]
*  You can hear them. I mean, you just, the bees are up at night. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=119.0s)]
*  They just, everything's just trying to bloom and bust and, and just go on dates and just everything. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=123.0s)]
*  I mean, it is damn senior prom for Mother Nature right now, baby. We are in the midst of spring. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=131.0s)]
*  Yeah, and I just got back from Maui. I went on a small vacation for myself. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=138.0s)]
*  Uh, to get, just get my, just let my credentials get in order. Just let the, just to let the sand settle inside of me a little bit. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=145.0s)]
*  And, um, and it felt good, you know, if you've never been to Maui, you got to go there. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=157.0s)]
*  I mean, it's a lot of honeymooners. So that was, you know, there's a lot of people holding hands and then sometimes everybody was holding hands so much. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=162.0s)]
*  I found I would just put one of my hands out and then just hold, just hold it with the other hand just so I didn't feel out of place sometimes. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=170.0s)]
*  And so, you know, I kind of walked around like a lot of, uh, you know, you know, a lot of religious guys will do that too. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=179.0s)]
*  They'll shake your hand. They put the other hand on top of it. They make that little hand, uh, hand, hand sandwich kind of out of, you know, just thank you for coming. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=188.0s)]
*  You know, people do that a lot of times at funerals. They put, they shake the hand, they put the other hand on it, they double it. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=198.0s)]
*  There you go. Just a little hand threesome right there. Just thank you for coming. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=204.0s)]
*  You know, people will do that when they just double hand you. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=208.0s)]
*  The first time it ever happens usually is at a church. They, some of somebody will double hand you like, damn, what happened, you know, especially I remember being young and just learning to shake hands. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=212.0s)]
*  You didn't know exactly how to, you know, sometimes I'd put my hand in backwards and just fucking just, you know, I'd put my thumb facing down and whoever was shaking your hand didn't know what the hell to do. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=223.0s)]
*  You know, the guy just, sometimes he just loses, just he'd come out the damn closet. He didn't even know what was happening, you know, just because if you, if you put your hand out and just the thumb is, it just blows somebody's mind in a handshake. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=235.0s)]
*  It's really, you can just really, somebody who's just been going through life very organized, shaking hands, you hit them with that upside down handshake and they just fucking, they can't handle it, you know, they'll damn, you know, they'll fucking get a divorce. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=247.0s)]
*  They don't, they just don't know what's going on. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=265.0s)]
*  And then you, when you're, when you're growing up, handshaking is such a, man, I remember when he first, somebody's like, well, shake their hand, you know, your mom tells you, shake their hand and you don't, you know, you suddenly you put your hand out that you don't know at first and then, [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=270.0s)]
*  and then one time my dad introduced me to somebody and the guy shook my hand so hard. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=287.0s)]
*  And I remember thinking, all right, motherfucker. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=293.0s)]
*  All right, boy. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=297.0s)]
*  Fucking punch your little kid in the neck when I see him. I just remember just thinking, I'm gonna, you know, I'm gonna get these bitches back. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=299.0s)]
*  This shit ain't over. I remember that the guy, my dad introduced me to the guy and the guy just shook my hand so hard. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=306.0s)]
*  And I just remember thinking, all right, bitch, this shit ain't over. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=313.0s)]
*  And I had just, you know, just a lot, you know, so much happens in a handshake. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=318.0s)]
*  Especially when you're learning the ropes of handshaking. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=325.0s)]
*  It's a crazy time for a young fella or young woman. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=329.0s)]
*  So then when you shake somebody's hand and they do the dub, when they, they do the regular handshake and then they put their hand on top of you, on the back of your hand. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=336.0s)]
*  And they're just running a train on your hand with their hands. It's just, it's too much. You're like, what? I didn't know we could do that. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=346.0s)]
*  I thought you could only do one hand. Just the rules keep changing, you know. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=354.0s)]
*  You're like, I thought we could only do one hand and this dude's tagging in his partner. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=358.0s)]
*  This dang, you know, this guy's, you know, the Steiner Brothers every hot thought, you know, it was just a cage match and he's running a damn Royal Rumbel on my hands. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=363.0s)]
*  It just, I remember this, just the slippery slopes of shaking hands and of learning what it was all like. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=375.0s)]
*  And that was kind of interesting to me. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=386.0s)]
*  And then I dated a gal for a while that would do a hard handshake and I'm like, I didn't want to introduce her to people. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=389.0s)]
*  Because I knew she'd just be rattling them. Just, you know, just damn, just, you know, testing their joints every time you freaking introduced her to somebody, she would just test their joints. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=397.0s)]
*  It felt like just that was tough. Jesus, I remember that. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=409.0s)]
*  Anyway, what's going on? I'll get into it. I went over to Maui, Hawaii to have a vacation for myself. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=420.0s)]
*  And, man, it just, it's so nice. And we got some beautiful calls that came in. We'll get into a little bit of the news. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=427.0s)]
*  And yeah, just living the day, baby. Living and just letting the Lord just hold my ass. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=435.0s)]
*  I want to let you know these tour dates this week, actually. Wednesday, I'll be in Albuquerque. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=446.0s)]
*  New Mexico. Thursday, I'll be in Midland, Midland, Texas. Friday, May 20th, I'll be in Lubbock, Texas. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=452.0s)]
*  And then May 21st, I'll be in Dallas, Texas. The following beginning of June 2nd, Savannah, Georgia. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=460.0s)]
*  If you have friends over there, tell them to come through. Augusta, Georgia, June 3rd, Montgomery, Alabama, June 4th, and Columbus, GA, June 5th. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=469.0s)]
*  Then I'll be in Florida, June 23rd through the 26th, Hollywood, Florida, Fort Myers, Daytona Beach, and Lakeland, Florida. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=481.0s)]
*  And that's all in June. Go to thetheovon.com slash T-O-U-R to get those tickets. Go through those links. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=493.0s)]
*  Don't let them get you on that secondary market. You know, those secondary tickets, they might have fentanyl in them. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=501.0s)]
*  You don't know. You don't know what's in them. So we just want you to get that first-hand, you know, fair price tickets. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=508.0s)]
*  What else? Oh, yeah, I went over to... We had some great shows out in Tulsa, Oklahoma. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=521.0s)]
*  And man, I just want to thank everybody that came through there. That place had been... It had been sold out for months, they said. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=527.0s)]
*  And the staff there was all excited. And yeah, I got into town over there. I was feeling a little rattled. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=535.0s)]
*  So I went and hit an AA meeting right before the show over there off of Lewis Drive over there. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=545.0s)]
*  They got a spot over there, I think the Unanimity Club or something deal. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=552.0s)]
*  I went over there with my shady-ass handshake and just... [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=557.0s)]
*  You know, that hand... It's just if somebody teaches you wrong how to hand... You just, you know... [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=563.0s)]
*  It just is interesting how somebody... That's the first thing they teach you, you know. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=569.0s)]
*  It's just... You know, it's just interesting. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=575.0s)]
*  Yeah, just a beautiful time over there in Tulsa. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=580.0s)]
*  And the staff, they said, you know, that that show had been sold out for months. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=586.0s)]
*  And it was just a lot of good people. I met three guys named Tyler in the lobby in a row. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=590.0s)]
*  I went down before the show to get me a little burger or something. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=598.0s)]
*  You know, a little... I didn't know what I wanted. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=602.0s)]
*  And that's the worst... The worst thing to do is wander downstairs into a casino not sure what you want. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=605.0s)]
*  Because you could end up with anything, son. You could end up with a little bit of hamburger. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=611.0s)]
*  You could end up with a damn debt. You could end up with a hooker. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=617.0s)]
*  You could end up with gay men chasing you. Men hookers. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=623.0s)]
*  So I think that has to be a new rule for me is when I leave a hotel room to have a plan in a casino. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=629.0s)]
*  But yeah, I went down there, met three Tyler's in a row. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=638.0s)]
*  I said, well, damn, too bad this, you know, that it's not a human slot machine where you get three Tyler's and you win something. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=641.0s)]
*  Because I met three Tyler's in a row. Boom, boom, boom. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=649.0s)]
*  Tyler, Tyler, Tyler. Hey, my name's Tyler. Hey, I'm Tyler. Guess what? Tyler. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=652.0s)]
*  So it was just triple Tyler's, man, right out the gate over there. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=659.0s)]
*  And yeah, I wish I'd gotten to meet everybody that came out. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=662.0s)]
*  We stayed after and met some people that milled around in the lobby. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=666.0s)]
*  And I'm grateful for that. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=670.0s)]
*  And then we went on, oh, Los Angeles. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=675.0s)]
*  Dude, that was crazy. That was that was crazy. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=678.0s)]
*  I mean, the crowds were so it was during the Netflix is a joke festival and Netflix didn't do shit for us. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=685.0s)]
*  So I want to thank everybody that came out and supported Netflix did all the advertising for so many other acts and they didn't give us shit. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=695.0s)]
*  And and our crowd came out and showed love, man. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=703.0s)]
*  So thank you, guys. That meant a lot to me. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=708.0s)]
*  And those shows, damn, just, you know, they had a dude in there who kept trying to show me his tattoo during the show. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=713.0s)]
*  This guy had a tattoo on his back of angel wings. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=723.0s)]
*  And the whole time he's trying to show me the tattoo. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=728.0s)]
*  And I'm just thinking, finally, I kind of see what he's saying. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=731.0s)]
*  And I'm like, all of this and I don't give a fuck, bro. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=735.0s)]
*  You know, I'm saying like that was like, I'm glad you got it. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=739.0s)]
*  But you know, like you don't have to. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=743.0s)]
*  This is the this is in the time and place for all this, dude. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=748.0s)]
*  The guy kept trying. He kept like kind of giving these hand motions and pulling his shirt. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=751.0s)]
*  I didn't know what he was doing. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=755.0s)]
*  Was he doing laundry? I didn't know what the guy was doing, but none of it made any sense. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=757.0s)]
*  And then finally, his buddy, this little guy with him who looked like he had. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=762.0s)]
*  The buddy looked like somebody had smoked had smoked him. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=769.0s)]
*  It looked like somebody had taken his friend and put him in a pipe and took a couple of hits off him. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=772.0s)]
*  You know, the dude just looked a little crisp, a little crisp out. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=778.0s)]
*  And I think even had like kind of burn marks, not like on his skin, [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=783.0s)]
*  but it's on his clothes like somebody at arm. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=786.0s)]
*  Try to, you know, do like a maybe small campfire or something like right next to him, like he had that kind of vibe, you know. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=789.0s)]
*  But anyway, that guy finally pulled up his buddy's shirt and he's pointing it like I don't. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=796.0s)]
*  I don't. And that's when I realized I don't give a fuck about that. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=802.0s)]
*  Like, there's a lot of things I do want to care about, but seeing a grown man's angel wing tats is not. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=807.0s)]
*  That is nowhere on my list of things that I really want to care about. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=815.0s)]
*  But yeah, thank you to everybody that came out, man, and showed love. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=820.0s)]
*  And those those shows were nuts. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=824.0s)]
*  They were just people were cheering so much. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=827.0s)]
*  It was like hard to even pay attention. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=830.0s)]
*  I didn't. There were times where I turned around and looked behind me. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=833.0s)]
*  I thought there was something like there was a football game going on behind me. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=837.0s)]
*  It was just it was live, man. It was really live. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=841.0s)]
*  What else occurred? [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=847.0s)]
*  Oh, I'll tell you about this, man. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=850.0s)]
*  So, oh, I went over to Maui and if you haven't been to Maui, then. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=852.0s)]
*  You got to do it. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=861.0s)]
*  You know, one of the nice things is the place shuts down early. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=863.0s)]
*  So nine o'clock you're in bed. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=866.0s)]
*  Everybody's in bed. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=868.0s)]
*  You can feel the whole everybody is in bed during every bed. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=869.0s)]
*  You can hear like every bed is just eaten, you know, because somebody filled that bitch up. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=874.0s)]
*  Every bed in the joint has got some something in its tummy, dude, [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=881.0s)]
*  something human just lodged right in the middle of it. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=886.0s)]
*  And it just feels there's a huge relaxation to it. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=889.0s)]
*  Oh, and then this this happened. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=895.0s)]
*  You know, some of you like you run you run in the guys and it's great. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=897.0s)]
*  But sometimes when you're in a hotel, you're any place you're going to be for a long time. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=903.0s)]
*  You could run into the guy countless times, you know, repetitionally. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=908.0s)]
*  And so this fell on at this hotel the second day and this guy says, what's up? [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=912.0s)]
*  He's a he's a nice guy being real friendly. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=919.0s)]
*  And and then finally, he goes, hey, man, the conversation had kind of gotten where there wasn't much left to say, which is OK. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=924.0s)]
*  That's when everybody kind of goes their separate ways. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=934.0s)]
*  And he goes, hey, man, I'm going to give you I'm going to give you six guesses what my name is. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=937.0s)]
*  And I'm like, oh, fuck, oh, far. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=944.0s)]
*  Because I don't want to do that. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=948.0s)]
*  I don't want that, man. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=951.0s)]
*  I'm I don't want that. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=953.0s)]
*  You know, I don't want I want no guesses how many how much what names the man is. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=957.0s)]
*  But, you know, I guess there there's a part of me that likes games, I guess. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=964.0s)]
*  So I said, Alex, you know, I'm going to give you six guesses. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=970.0s)]
*  So I said, Alex and and he goes, no, but that's close. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=975.0s)]
*  And he goes, I'll give you three extra guesses. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=984.0s)]
*  And I'm like, oh, fuck, dude, I don't want that. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=986.0s)]
*  I don't want that, man. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=992.0s)]
*  I don't want that extra guesses. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=994.0s)]
*  I don't. So now I have nine guesses, minus one. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=997.0s)]
*  Now I have eight guesses what this guy's name is, and I don't want no guesses. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=1000.0s)]
*  So anyway, he goes, and you don't have to guess again right now. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=1008.0s)]
*  I'll see you around the way. Right. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=1012.0s)]
*  Because he worked at the place. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=1014.0s)]
*  So, dude, I kept I ran into this guy. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=1016.0s)]
*  I ran into this guy. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=1022.0s)]
*  I mean, I ran into this guy 30 more times over the week, and it was just a nightmare. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=1026.0s)]
*  And finally, you know, I guess like I did like two other guesses because there was, you know, one day I had already done my word or whatever. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=1031.0s)]
*  And so I was like, I need a game to play. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=1037.0s)]
*  And he fucking wandered up and he always wandered up. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=1039.0s)]
*  I mean, he would wander up on a damn wind. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=1043.0s)]
*  You know, I mean, somebody would call off a few feet away and he'd he'd wander right up out of their damn esophagus. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=1046.0s)]
*  This dude wandered up. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=1052.0s)]
*  You know, he was the kind of guy that wandered up. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=1054.0s)]
*  So finally, I'm trying to guess. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=1057.0s)]
*  And I'm like, Tyler, is it Tyler? [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=1060.0s)]
*  The guy tells me that his name is Galaxy. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=1063.0s)]
*  And that's why Alex was close. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=1068.0s)]
*  And at that point, I knew it was time to leave, man. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=1072.0s)]
*  It was time to leave, bro. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=1076.0s)]
*  That's when that's when it's time to go. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=1078.0s)]
*  So what else happened there? [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=1082.0s)]
*  Beautiful place. If you've never been to Maui, you need to go. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=1085.0s)]
*  And you need to also they have a place there, Mama's Fish House over there up near Pai'i. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=1089.0s)]
*  You roll up there and do you got to know like there was no reservation. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=1098.0s)]
*  So I call a few times. There's no reservation. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=1103.0s)]
*  And then I was up there anyway, looking for a swimming hole. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=1106.0s)]
*  Where I picked up a hitchhiker last time I was there. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=1110.0s)]
*  I pick up a hitchhiker and because I love hitchhikers, baby. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=1113.0s)]
*  Now, that's a game. That's a game show. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=1117.0s)]
*  You want to do a game show, pick up a hitchhiker and see what God wants for you. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=1119.0s)]
*  Because that's the devil's Rochambeau, baby. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=1128.0s)]
*  Hitchhikers. Hello. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=1132.0s)]
*  Hello. Yeah. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=1134.0s)]
*  So anyway, man, yeah. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=1139.0s)]
*  What was I talking about? [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=1142.0s)]
*  Jeremy, was I talking about? Do you know? [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=1144.0s)]
*  Like before Maui? Yeah. Oh, no. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=1147.0s)]
*  Yeah, I don't know when I was talking about anything, but, oh, I'll tell you this, man. [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=1151.0s)]

*  Oh, a man died, bro. [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=1165.0s)]

*  And in the place I'm staying at, man, I treated myself. [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=1180.0s)]
*  The place I'm staying was pretty nice, dude. [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=1184.0s)]
*  They had like a concierge breakfast. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=1186.0s)]
*  And I'm sitting down there, you know, and it's fucking, you know, [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=1189.0s)]

*  I didn't get a look at his plate. [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=1340.0s)]
*  But. [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=1344.0s)]
*  My friend had joined me. [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=1346.0s)]
*  We're sitting over there and we are. [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=1347.0s)]
*  You know, she's doing a crossword or doing whatever brought her some joy. [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=1350.0s)]
*  And there's a rambunction in the corner. [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=1354.0s)]
*  And I didn't know what it was. [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=1358.0s)]
*  I thought maybe it was one of those Charles and, you know, Charles and Charlie's or whatever, where they shake the guy's neck and they put the liquor in his face and they shake your stepdad's neck or whatever until he can't even breathe or something. [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=1360.0s)]
*  And then they call it, you know, they're like, hey, you go fatty. [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=1374.0s)]
*  You know, they say stuff like that to him, but they put the liquor in his mouth and they got the whistle and shit. [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=1378.0s)]
*  And then they, you know, put take a picture or whatever and they put sell you like a magnet or whatever. [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=1383.0s)]
*  I thought it was that kind of thing because there's like a big rambunction. [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=1387.0s)]
*  But then I look over and they're yelling somebody yelling 911 and I'm like, that is that's old fashioned. [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=1391.0s)]
*  That doesn't make any sense, really. [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=1398.0s)]
*  But but then other people realize, oh, call 911. [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=1399.0s)]
*  So because some guys just yelling 911 911. [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=1403.0s)]
*  I'm like, oh, man, I don't know. [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=1406.0s)]
*  I guess that's I mean, it's definitely how it works, but it's just an older way of doing it. [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=1410.0s)]
*  So anyway, people started calling 911 and then they just ask that anybody be a doctor here. [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=1416.0s)]
*  And then when you're sitting there as a man, you're like, damn, you realize you have no skills, bro. [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=1422.0s)]
*  That's what I realized anyway. [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=1429.0s)]
*  I'm like, damn, they somebody there. [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=1431.0s)]
*  They had the man on the ground. [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=1433.0s)]
*  And I mean, this brave guy came over and and he's suddenly the bravest dude in the room because he knew skills to do CPR. [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=1434.0s)]
*  So he's doing it. [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=1445.0s)]
*  There's a nurse lady there. [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=1446.0s)]
*  She's doing it and they're just helping. [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=1447.0s)]
*  And then the rest of us are just sitting there. [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=1450.0s)]
*  And I just felt like, oh, man, I don't have any blood. [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=1453.0s)]
*  I don't have any life saving skills. [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=1460.0s)]
*  And there's something about that. [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=1466.0s)]
*  It hits you. [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=1467.0s)]
*  You're like, damn, all the things I've learned and I haven't learned this scale. [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=1468.0s)]
*  I haven't learned a real and the worst part. [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=1473.0s)]
*  Oh, here's the worst part. [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=1476.0s)]
*  So they're over there. They say they got they're bringing him back and he goes back to the other side. [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=1478.0s)]
*  I mean, he's just playing Red Rover with the devil over there, you know, or with the Lord. [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=1482.0s)]
*  I don't know his backstory. [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=1486.0s)]
*  But that guy is just they're like, you know, send, you know, Andy or whatever, you know, Red Rover, you know, send and and they're just he's going back. [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=1487.0s)]
*  He's in and out and in and out. [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=1494.0s)]
*  And they're like, we're losing and we're gaining and we're losing and we're gaining them. [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=1496.0s)]
*  And and I didn't know what to do, dude. [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=1499.0s)]
*  And then this is the saddest part. [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=1503.0s)]
*  I just started eating again. [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=1505.0s)]
*  And I'm like, oh, my God, am I the kind of guy that just eats when somebody's dying? [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=1509.0s)]
*  Oh, man. So that kind of broke my heart. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=1515.0s)]
*  I'm like, and I remember just like I cut into this sausage patty and I'm like, there's no way you're going to eat right now. [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=1518.0s)]
*  Right. Because there was like it was obvious there was like a group of people that had gone over to help. [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=1526.0s)]
*  And if you can't help, you got to stay out the way. [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=1531.0s)]
*  You can't be over there just, you know, lighting candles or like, you know, somebody was there with his wife. [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=1533.0s)]
*  So everything, you know, all the corners were kind of covered. [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=1540.0s)]
*  And I said a few prayers. [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=1543.0s)]
*  But then. I just started eating this sausage patty, dude. [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=1545.0s)]
*  And it fuck honestly, man, it broke my heart. [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=1554.0s)]
*  I'm like, do I? I don't know. [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=1557.0s)]
*  It just there was something about it. [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=1561.0s)]
*  It was just a lot, man. [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=1563.0s)]
*  I'm like, oh, and I had one bite. [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=1564.0s)]
*  I'm like, there's no way I'm going to have another bite because you can hear them doing the CPR. [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=1567.0s)]
*  And then I had another bite and I'm like, oh, my God, bro, just stop eating. [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=1571.0s)]
*  Just stop eating. [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=1581.0s)]
*  If there's any time where God is looking down at the earth to see what's happening, it's when somebody's transporting through. [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=1583.0s)]
*  You know, the portal between life and death is open here. [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=1592.0s)]
*  And this guy is about to frickin Andy do frame his way up there. [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=1596.0s)]
*  And I'm sitting there eating, bro. [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=1601.0s)]
*  Oh, it was so bad, man. [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=1605.0s)]

*  That seemed like a perfect part of the Biden administration's, you know, insurance medical deal. [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=2341.0s)]
*  Let's get birth control put into the meat at RBs. [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=2348.0s)]

*  That's where, I mean, I'm telling you, we are getting to a place where you can't count. [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=2384.0s)]
*  You can't count on these big companies anymore. [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=2389.0s)]
*  They're all in lawsuits. [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=2392.0s)]
*  There's two, they don't know any, they're too disconnected from the customer. [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=2394.0s)]

*  Men are trying to do, you see a lot of gay men trying to, and they don't even have kids. [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=2419.0s)]
*  They're just trying to do ejaculate out of their nipples. [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=2424.0s)]
*  Just crazy, it's getting weird, man. [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=2429.0s)]

*  Especially Utah, you up at that high elevation. [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=2440.0s)]
*  So if you don't think you can sell that high elevation freaking bee skeet, baby, you know what I'm talking about, breast milk. [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=2445.0s)]
*  If you don't think you can sell that for a decent dollar, baby, then you're wrong, honey. [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=2452.0s)]
*  If you're sitting around just doing wordle all day and you got them freaking forest lumps, baby, [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=2459.0s)]

*  Juice them, bitches, hey. [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=2482.0s)]
*  I'll buy a hot gram of breast milk off of somebody. [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=2485.0s)]
*  And especially, this is basic white Utah breast milk, man. [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=2489.0s)]
*  That's just the basic homogenized shit. [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=2494.0s)]
*  You get in there, you get a nice urban lady out there. [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=2496.0s)]
*  She got those extra red blood cells up in the milk. [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=2499.0s)]
*  Or you get a Native American lady and she got the, you know what I'm saying, she got the forefathers in the milk. [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=2503.0s)]

*  I don't know. Trajectory? [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=2529.0s)]
*  Yeah, I don't know. No, no, no, that's not a good guess. [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=2534.0s)]
*  Verticals, they call it verticals. [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=2538.0s)]
*  Other ways you can make money on it. [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=2540.0s)]
*  But yeah, if you, yeah, so there's, I mean, there's definitely some upsells in there. [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=2542.0s)]

*  Now, a lot of ladies don't realize if you're slanging breast milk on the Internet, [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=2557.0s)]
*  then you can also slang that night batch. [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=2564.0s)]
*  You know, that if you want to sell that nocturnal frickin, that nocturnal nipple beverage, baby, you know what I'm talking about, titty milk. [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=2567.0s)]

*  Anyway, so it's Mother's Day morning and I'm just wondering what has a single mama got to do to get some good, some good love? [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=2765.0s)]
*  And all these men are scared. [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=2777.0s)]
*  I mean, for me personally, I feel like if you got a single mom coming for you, you know, and like putting the heat on you, it's like you already got half the equation figured out. [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=2779.0s)]

*  You know she could keep your offspring alive. [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=2797.0s)]
*  You know, it's like, what's the big, what's the big question here? [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=2799.0s)]
*  You know, I mean, yeah, look, I mean, I think. [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=2802.0s)]
*  Well, let me hear more. [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=2808.0s)]
*  Let me hear more. [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=2809.0s)]
*  What's going on? [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=2810.0s)]
*  So you're trying to get a little action and you're from down there in Covington, Louisiana, and I appreciate the beautiful place there. [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=2811.0s)]
*  And I was conceived somewhere over there near the Chifunctah River over there and a lot of snakes around there and a lot of. [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=2816.0s)]
*  Mosquitos. [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=2823.0s)]
*  Malaria was big when I was young. [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=2824.0s)]
*  And what else? [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=2828.0s)]
*  Rabies. [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=2829.0s)]
*  Definitely down there in the bottom of the rabies belt. [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=2830.0s)]
*  Let's hear more. [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=2834.0s)]
*  Why is everybody so terrified of single moms? [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=2836.0s)]
*  Or maybe it's just me. [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=2840.0s)]
*  It could just be me. [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=2842.0s)]
*  But there was somebody that I got a little involved with. [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=2846.0s)]
*  And he told me that he was this big, the Yovon fan. [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=2850.0s)]
*  I was like, oh, I know that guy from Covington. [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=2853.0s)]
*  I don't know you, but I know that you're from Covington. [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=2855.0s)]
*  Me too. [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=2858.0s)]
*  Anyway, I was like, well, shit, I'm going to have to call this motherfucker and find out what kind of message in you given these boys, because I mean, they're going out on the street saying, yeah, the Yovon, the Yovon, big fan of single moms, single moms. [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=2859.0s)]
*  You know, it's Mother's Day Eve. [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=2872.0s)]
*  I sent that booty call. [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=2874.0s)]
*  It was just me and the magic wand this morning, man. [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=2876.0s)]
*  Dang, baby girl. [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=2879.0s)]
*  Dang. [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=2881.0s)]
*  Dang. [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=2882.0s)]
*  Well, also, if you've given your body away to that magic wand all the time, then, you know, I think a lot of men can sense that. [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=2884.0s)]
*  A lot of men can sense sometimes if if that garden has been hand dug or if it's somebody's been using a rotor on it. [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=2891.0s)]
*  So that could be could be something. [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=2901.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=2903.0s)]
*  Now, that's just I'm just gesticulate or verb. [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=2904.0s)]
*  I'm just speaking. [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=2907.0s)]
*  But now, look, if you if you met a guy, he said he's a Theo Yovon fan. [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=2909.0s)]
*  He's he's texting you and stuff, but he's not coming over and putting it down. [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=2913.0s)]
*  That sounds like a Theo Yovon fan. [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=2919.0s)]
*  You know what I'm saying, girl? [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=2922.0s)]
*  That's what we do, baby. [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=2924.0s)]
*  We front it up, but we don't back it up a lot of times. [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=2926.0s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=2929.0s)]
*  Especially look, if he's if he probably jerked off on the way over there, if I'm real honest with you, dude, I was in love one time with this girl. [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=2930.0s)]
*  And the problem was it was 17 miles to get to her place. [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=2940.0s)]
*  And this was out near Covington. [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=2944.0s)]
*  And if you went up north of Covington and 17 miles when you all horned out, you know, when you really young and just full of just bust, you know, I mean, you just nuts are just made out of damn just God's dynamite, baby. [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=2945.0s)]
*  You know what I'm talking about? [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=2959.0s)]
*  Seamen. [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=2960.0s)]
*  And when you are just just your nuts are just rationed up to the top with that sweet cream, can I have some? [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=2962.0s)]
*  I mean, there's only you can't drive 17 miles without pulling over and relieving yourself somewhere near a damn mile marker. [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=2970.0s)]
*  You know, if you want to bet $40 that I haven't eject on the back of a damn mile marker, then you're going to lose your money. [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=2979.0s)]
*  I'm going to tell you that right now, baby. [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=2985.0s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=2987.0s)]
*  Thirty six point five, baby. [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=2988.0s)]
*  So, yeah, look, I'm just saying that could that could have been it. [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=2993.0s)]
*  The guy is so nervous he can't even handle law. [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=2996.0s)]
*  You know, it's hard to drive when your body's full of the devil's fever. [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=2999.0s)]
*  It's hard to drive that sickness across town without pulling over to relieve it. [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=3005.0s)]
*  So, but yeah, we appreciate the call there, lady, and we hope somebody comes over and gets that throbbing and really just robs that throbbing right out of your crotch for you. [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=3010.0s)]
*  And, yeah, we'll get back to doing some stuff for some single moms and stuff soon or single dads. [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=3020.0s)]

*  That's a fact, man. [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=3035.0s)]
*  When you have high interest debt, that's a double fact, man. [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=3036.0s)]
*  When you have debt, but you're also paying a high interest rate, it just hurts you. [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=3040.0s)]
*  It hurts you. [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=3043.0s)]
*  Dang, it hurts you. [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=3044.0s)]
*  Dang nuts in your back. [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=3045.0s)]

*  But the interest month after month can feel like you're in a never ending hamster wheel. [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=3053.0s)]

*  Look, after years of fine print contracts and getting ripped off by big wireless providers, [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=3120.0s)]
*  if we've learned anything, it's that there's always a catch. [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=3125.0s)]
*  So when I first heard that Mint Mobile was offering premium wireless at just 15 bucks a month, [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=3129.0s)]
*  I said, well, what's the catch? [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=3138.0s)]
*  Well, Mint Mobile doesn't have a retail store, so they cut out that brook and mortal. [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=3141.0s)]
*  You don't have to do that anymore. [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=3146.0s)]

*  Hey, Theo. [[00:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=3197.0s)]
*  It's Chris Doss. [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=3199.0s)]
*  I'm currently stationed at... [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=3201.0s)]
*  What's up, Chris? Thanks for calling in, brother. [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=3204.0s)]
*  And Chris is a name short for Christmas. [[00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=3207.0s)]
*  Short for what else? [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=3209.0s)]
*  Uh... [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=3212.0s)]
*  Galaxy? No. [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=3216.0s)]
*  I don't know what else. Let's hear more. [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=3219.0s)]
*  Fort Riley, Kansas, but I'm getting out of the Army. [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=3222.0s)]
*  I'm going back home to good old fucking Palmdale, California. [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=3226.0s)]
*  Palmdale, CA. I did a comedy show up there one time and almost got abused actually in a parking lot up there. [[00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=3230.0s)]
*  Homeward? [[00:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=3237.0s)]
*  Kind of a bittersweet feeling, but... [[00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=3239.0s)]
*  I don't know, man. I feel like I failed a lot in my Army career and the career that I've had a chance in before the Army. [[00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=3243.0s)]
*  I was supposed to be a part of the music industry, all this shit, [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=3252.0s)]
*  and I pissed it all away because of bad habits and drugs and thinking I was Mr. Fucking Know-It-All. [[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=3256.0s)]
*  But I don't know. What kind of... [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=3262.0s)]
*  I'm kind of asking, like, what do you do to make yourself feel like... [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=3266.0s)]
*  not like a failure, I guess you could say. [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=3272.0s)]
*  I'm just struggling, man, because everywhere I turn, I feel like I fuck it up. [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=3275.0s)]
*  I feel like I never get anything right, man. [[00:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=3279.0s)]
*  So a little bit of advice would help, man. [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=3282.0s)]
*  Thanks for the call, man. [[00:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=3285.0s)]
*  And I'm sorry that you're feeling like that. [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=3288.0s)]
*  I want to let you know right off the bat, you sound like a confident young man. [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=3291.0s)]
*  You sound like you've got a good voice on your strong throat. [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=3296.0s)]
*  You're able to speak. [[00:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=3299.0s)]
*  I just want to remind you, you're calling because you care about yourself. [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=3302.0s)]
*  You're trying to take action. [[00:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=3306.0s)]
*  So those are all really cool things you're doing for yourself, man. [[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=3308.0s)]
*  So a failure doesn't do any of that. [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=3312.0s)]
*  Well, for myself, sometimes my own perception, I can't rely on it. [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=3315.0s)]
*  Because my perception is too harsh on me. [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=3319.0s)]
*  My perception doesn't remember the wins that I do. [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=3322.0s)]
*  My perception chooses to not make me the hero sometimes. [[00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=3325.0s)]
*  And I don't mean in an egotistical way. [[00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=3331.0s)]
*  It chooses to not give me the benefit of the doubt. [[00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=3334.0s)]
*  Sometimes I treat myself in ways that I would never treat somebody else. [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=3338.0s)]
*  So I have to then ask other people, I have to get people around me that I trust. [[00:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=3343.0s)]
*  And ask them, what do you think is going on here? [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=3350.0s)]
*  Am I okay? [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=3354.0s)]
*  Am I a failure? [[00:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=3356.0s)]
*  And I have to take their word for it. [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=3358.0s)]
*  And if I trust those people and take their word and I believe them, believe that they care about me, [[00:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=3361.0s)]
*  then I know that they would tell me the truth. [[00:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=3367.0s)]
*  So sometimes my own... [[00:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=3370.0s)]
*  As much of a bummer as it is to say, [[00:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=3375.0s)]
*  my own perception is not the best place for me to get a judgment of myself. [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=3380.0s)]
*  I think we live in a time and an environment where we don't know the effects of seeing so much of ourselves all the time [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=3388.0s)]
*  and of how much of we are getting our perception from the outside instead of the inside, [[00:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=3395.0s)]
*  where it used to come from, which I think was a much healthier place. [[00:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=3403.0s)]
*  And as far as being a failure, man, I'll tell you what, a failure is somebody that doesn't try. [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=3410.0s)]
*  I know I mentioned that, but a failure isn't somebody that's trying to figure out what's going on with themselves. [[00:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=3416.0s)]
*  I feel like a failure all the time, man. [[00:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=3422.0s)]
*  I compare myself to my friends. I look at certain things. [[00:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=3425.0s)]
*  I look at what... This isn't perfect. I'm a failure. [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=3428.0s)]
*  I'm a failure. [[00:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=3432.0s)]
*  What the fuck is wrong with you? [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=3434.0s)]
*  Why can't you do things right? [[00:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=3437.0s)]
*  And the truth is, that voice isn't really mine, man. [[00:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=3440.0s)]
*  That's not a good... [[00:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=3445.0s)]
*  It's not safe for me to really even listen to that voice inside of me. [[00:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=3449.0s)]
*  I'm not a good person. [[00:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=3454.0s)]
*  I'm not a good person. [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=3457.0s)]
*  I can't even listen to that voice inside of me. [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=3460.0s)]
*  Because, yeah, failure doesn't try. [[00:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=3467.0s)]
*  You know, a failure doesn't try, man. [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=3470.0s)]
*  And so I know that by even making... You're trying to see what's going on. You're trying. [[00:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=3473.0s)]
*  So those things didn't work out. That's okay. [[00:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=3478.0s)]
*  But now if we don't learn from those things, then that's where we start to see patterns where it's like, man, [[00:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=3481.0s)]
*  I'm not a failure, but I am a repeater. [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=3487.0s)]
*  Now that's one thing. Look, I'll be a dang repeater, dog. [[00:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=3491.0s)]
*  You know, I'll piss in my own milkshake a lot of times. [[00:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=3496.0s)]
*  And I'll sit there and swig on it and pretend I didn't, man. [[00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=3500.0s)]
*  But after a while, I gotta realize that some of this urine taste is because of me. [[00:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=3503.0s)]
*  So... [[00:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=3511.0s)]
*  You know, you might be making some missteps here or there, but you also might just be making some steps. [[00:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=3514.0s)]
*  You know, a step isn't always... [[00:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=3519.0s)]
*  A step is always positive, but it's not always forward. [[00:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=3523.0s)]
*  You know, it could be, you know, I don't know. [[00:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=3527.0s)]
*  I'm just saying, man, that you're trying, bro. [[00:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=3531.0s)]
*  And failures don't try, and you're learning things. You're gonna take these pieces of what you've learned. [[00:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=3534.0s)]
*  You might take a piece of the military and a piece of the music, you know. [[00:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=3539.0s)]
*  You might build a machine gun that shoots songs at people, you know. [[00:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=3543.0s)]
*  And just hit somebody with a damn... [[00:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=3548.0s)]
*  You know, you may hit somebody with a damn first class, you know. [[00:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=3551.0s)]
*  You might damn just, you know, do a drive-by at a... [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=3556.0s)]
*  You know, somewhere and next thing you know, everybody's singing Aerosmith. [[00:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=3562.0s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? You might invent something that... [[00:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=3569.0s)]
*  You just don't know what the pieces that you are doing, what those are gonna be used for. [[00:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=3571.0s)]
*  So I don't think you're failing, man. I think you're learning, though. I hope you are. [[00:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=3576.0s)]
*  You know, and I think you're training for whatever the best you is gonna be. [[00:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=3582.0s)]
*  And I know it's hard, man. I know it's hard. [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=3588.0s)]
*  You know? [[00:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=3595.0s)]
*  Just don't feel like you're alone. And just don't give up, man. [[00:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=3598.0s)]
*  And if nothing changes, nothing changes. You gotta remember that. [[01:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=3604.0s)]
*  You know, and for myself, you know, I get back in a 12-step. [[01:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=3609.0s)]
*  You know, I've recently really leaned back into my recovery program. [[01:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=3613.0s)]
*  And there's even little moments during this podcast where I feel more like myself than I have in years. [[01:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=3617.0s)]
*  And yeah, I got therapy today. I'm gonna talk to my sponsor later today. [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=3623.0s)]
*  I'm putting things in place for me that I know are gonna help me have a better future, that are gonna help me take care of myself. [[01:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=3630.0s)]
*  And I don't even want to really sometimes. [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=3639.0s)]
*  You know, the craziest thing is sometimes I don't even want to take care of myself. [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=3642.0s)]
*  There's a part of me that doesn't even want to take care of me. [[01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=3646.0s)]
*  Because I think some of that part of me is just like, oh, this was somebody else's job a long time ago and they never did it. [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=3653.0s)]
*  And why do I have to still be doing this job? [[01:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=3659.0s)]
*  You know? [[01:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=3663.0s)]
*  But I can't let that part of me win. [[01:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=3666.0s)]
*  Not today anyway. [[01:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=3670.0s)]
*  But look, man, I love you, bro. And I'm proud of you. [[01:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=3673.0s)]
*  And thank you for your service, dude. Thank you for going and trying. [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=3676.0s)]
*  You know how many times I sit around regretting that I didn't even try? [[01:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=3678.0s)]
*  You might be able to go back in sometimes. [[01:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=3681.0s)]
*  Fuck, just put on some high boots and listen to two episodes of Jocko, bro. [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOyLFU-LcM&t=3684.0s)]
