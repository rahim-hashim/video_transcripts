*  That's what it feels like. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=578.6800000000001s)]
*  Even people should be able to, you know, like when, you know, growing up in Detroit, [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=579.44s)]
*  the auto industry and, you know, being very close to my father had, you know, a [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=582.9200000000001s)]
*  dealership and it was very successful. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=586.6s)]
*  And all my buddies, you know, their parents worked on the lines or work for [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=588.5600000000001s)]
*  Ford Chrysler, one of the, you know, stamping plants, manufacturing things for cars. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=592.32s)]
*  And, you know, back then, you know, in the hay day, when everything was going on, [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=596.44s)]
*  like you could work at Ford Motor Company or whatever GM and you know, you had, [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=599.5200000000001s)]
*  your house was paid for, you had a cottage up North with a boat, you know, [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=604.96s)]
*  maybe a 66 Chevelle or something in your driveway. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=608.72s)]
*  And like that, that's, you know, we need to, we need to get back to that. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=611.0400000000001s)]
*  But, you know, you got to get things under control with inflation, everything else, [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=613.9200000000001s)]
*  because, you know, you call it the Democrats hate what the Republicans do, cutting [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=617.4s)]
*  taxes, they call it trickle down economics because now all the rich are getting [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=621.72s)]
*  richer. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=625.12s)]
*  It's like, it's kind of part of the American dream. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=625.44s)]
*  That's how shit works. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=627.6s)]
*  You want to be, you want to support capitalism. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=628.52s)]
*  Yes, there's going to be some bad actors and monopolies that sometimes need to be [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=631.08s)]
*  broken up ticket master. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=634.24s)]
*  But, you know, people should have that opportunity and it should be probably, [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=636.64s)]
*  you know, back then, like I said, we got to get that back. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=640.76s)]
*  But it's like, you know, like, OK, they're going to pay workers, I think, [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=643.36s)]
*  20 bucks an hour to work fast food in California. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=645.4399999999999s)]
*  It's like this should not be a career fucking job. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=648.92s)]
*  Right. Maybe if you're manager or something, I get it. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=652.7199999999999s)]
*  But this is where you start off, you know, where we had our first jobs working at [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=655.04s)]
*  Kmart or working at McDonald's or something like this is not a place like you go to [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=659.04s)]
*  work to support your family. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=662.92s)]
*  Yeah. Career. And now all they do is, OK, we're paying 20 bucks an hour. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=665.72s)]
*  OK, a Big Mac's fucking seven dollars now. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=669.4s)]
*  Nobody wins. Oh, I see what you're saying. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=671.88s)]
*  They just raise the price of what it is. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=673.72s)]
*  Yeah, I think, well, you have to pay people a better wage, though, I think. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=675.8000000000001s)]
*  I think in some places it's still like seven dollars or something. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=680.2s)]
*  Like you can't, someone can't work all day and make fifty six dollars. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=684.88s)]
*  Well, it depends where you're starting. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=689.76s)]
*  What you're doing. That's a good point. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=691.4s)]
*  If you're a high school student, though, then it's totally different. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=692.44s)]
*  That's a good point. I picked apples for 25 cents a bushel. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=695.0s)]
*  Like, you know, I wasn't buying a new moped with that. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=697.88s)]
*  Right. You know, I was have a little money in my pocket. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=701.24s)]
*  Go to the movies and the other. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=703.04s)]
*  And it's just I believe everybody should make a great wage and should be treated fairly. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=704.36s)]
*  But at the same time, if that company is not doing it, fuck them. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=708.0s)]
*  Yeah. Go find another job. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=711.56s)]
*  Make yourself better. And if you make yourself at the best, whatever it is you do in life, [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=713.08s)]
*  if you're organized, you know, if you make your bed in the morning, start there [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=717.76s)]
*  and you go to work with a positive attitude and you try to learn and you try to better yourself. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=720.96s)]
*  I don't care what position you're in. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=724.68s)]
*  I tell everybody that works morning. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=726.3199999999999s)]
*  I want you to make me not be able to get rid of you. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=727.92s)]
*  And when you come for a raise, I have no choice but to say, hell, yeah, you're invaluable. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=731.68s)]
*  Wow. And that's the truth, man. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=735.8s)]
*  That's a great. You're right, bro. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=738.3599999999999s)]
*  If somebody works hard, you cannot afford to lose them. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=740.04s)]
*  Yeah. You know, and you won't. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=742.88s)]
*  You won't, man. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=744.88s)]
*  Good people are hard to find and even harder to replace, [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=746.52s)]
*  especially when you're talking business and that. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=749.04s)]
*  But I would, you know, I would I would applaud that even in friendships, [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=750.76s)]
*  you know, anything, not just business. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=754.96s)]
*  One of. One of my mentors, he said one time he goes, he goes, [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=756.96s)]
*  if you want to know the cost of hiring somebody expensive, hire somebody cheap. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=761.76s)]
*  It was something like that. Yeah. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=765.4s)]
*  I would I would say the same thing as, you know, it's very it's so easy to hire someone. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=767.08s)]
*  Yeah. Fucking hard to fire them. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=771.72s)]
*  So this is why when you go to college, I always I told my son, I tell, you know, [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=774.04s)]
*  friends, nieces, nephews and things. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=778.4s)]
*  I'm like, you want to intern at whatever level, whether it's high school, [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=780.0s)]
*  whether you go to college, whatever it is, whatever you want to do, [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=783.64s)]
*  you need to start and you need to enter because this that company is vetting you, [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=785.68s)]
*  you know, to hire you. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=790.08s)]
*  They want to see what type of fuck up you are. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=791.88s)]
*  If you are at all, they want to see what you know. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=793.72s)]
*  Are you able to learn new things, move on, you know, because, you know, [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=795.52s)]
*  getting a good job like it's it's it's pretty easy to hire someone. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=798.72s)]
*  So you go through this vetting process to try and get them. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=802.2s)]
*  But firing people. Fucking tough. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=804.2s)]
*  Yeah. There's so much protection and stuff for employees and stuff, [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=806.32s)]
*  which in some places there should be. But yeah. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=809.28s)]
*  Oh, even here in Tennessee, we got the you know, just for people that work with me [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=811.24s)]
*  and people on the farm and whatnot, it's just we got things posted everywhere. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=814.92s)]
*  Because you have to, you know, they can read workers rights. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=818.8s)]
*  And it's crazy. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=821.4399999999999s)]
*  You know, my thing is like, I would like to work out different things [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=822.6s)]
*  with different people on some levels we do, but we got to go by the book. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=825.28s)]
*  It's like people can't work over 40 hours a week without being paid overtime. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=828.16s)]
*  I don't do anything that's not by the book. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=831.8399999999999s)]
*  I don't. I'm sure Uncle Sam's already got their fucking eye on me pretty good. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=833.6s)]
*  Oh, I sure have been audited before and all my shit's in order. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=837.16s)]

*  And they're like, yeah, you owe us 450 fucking million dollars. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=885.16s)]
*  And we're going to start taking your shit. Yeah. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=888.4s)]
*  They're going to spark a fucking civil war. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=890.36s)]
*  That's one that that's the part that I start to worry about is like, [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=892.88s)]

*  First of all, if this is what's if this is [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=984.28s)]
*  you shouldn't then allow children and adults in the same locker room, [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=988.36s)]
*  because that's if there's a child in there, that's a ladies with her daughter [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=993.56s)]
*  or something like who cares? [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=998.4s)]

*  My private spaces out in public, I can deal with anybody. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=1029.92s)]
*  That's you know, I'm a freedom loving American. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=1033.04s)]
*  And unfortunately, that means there's a lot of weird shit that could happen. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=1035.28s)]
*  I'm cool with that. But my private space is to stay the fuck away from me. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=1037.8799999999999s)]
*  But what so where does somebody like this? [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=1041.0s)]
*  They just go to the men's room. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=1043.56s)]
*  Then you're thinking, wow, I guess I just I wonder if you're like [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=1044.64s)]

*  I agree. Whatever that shit is. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=1058.3600000000001s)]
*  Have one extra restroom then that's for trans people. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=1059.72s)]
*  But then you're going to get to the point where somebody is like, well, then we need a rest. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=1062.32s)]
*  That's that is part of the road that you go down when you go down that kind of stuff. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=1065.76s)]
*  But yeah, I agree, dude, this would be so. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=1069.6s)]
*  And if you have a child in there, it's like like I was at the airport in Los Angeles [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=1072.6s)]
*  and there's a gender neutral restroom and a kid went in and then a guy went in. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=1076.7199999999998s)]

*  I don't care if it's just my grandmother and her friends hanging out. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=1090.36s)]
*  It's like, now, get the fuck out of here. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=1093.4399999999998s)]

*  And if you love firing on sports, [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=1109.28s)]

*  sports app for you. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=1118.0s)]

*  NCAA, UFC and many more. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=1123.84s)]
*  Instead of choosing teams, you choose individual players. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=1127.8799999999999s)]
*  That's what I think is so unique about PrizePix. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=1131.36s)]
*  Each player has a set projection and you either choose more [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=1135.3999999999999s)]
*  or less than that set projection. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=1139.12s)]
*  So you could go Anthony Edwards, more than 18 points, [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=1142.08s)]
*  or you could go Zion Williamson, more than 11 rebounds. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=1147.6799999999998s)]
*  If you're smart with sports and you know what players [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=1152.9199999999998s)]

*  I'm like, I can teach. Yeah, I can. [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=1381.4s)]
*  I can teach you. I can show you young sensei. [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=1383.44s)]
*  You're like, I'm not either. [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=1386.24s)]
*  From that day on, he was he was down. [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=1387.8s)]
*  He was in the crew. And wow, he was one of the guys. [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=1389.4s)]
*  I miss him every day, man. [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=1391.88s)]
*  Yeah. What happened to him? He had kidney failure. [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=1393.48s)]
*  He had celiac disease, misdiagnosed as a kid. [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=1395.64s)]
*  So we had to take, God bless him, like 72 pills a day. [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=1398.6000000000001s)]
*  He had kind of this like dialysis machine. [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=1401.64s)]
*  He hooked up at night just deep. [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=1403.3200000000002s)]
*  So it's tough to bring him on the road. [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=1405.48s)]
*  But I'm glad he went to a lot of spots with us to be able to see like. [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=1406.76s)]
*  And this was when we were fucking nutbags. [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=1410.68s)]
*  Raging. We were just following the book of the handbook of rock and roll [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=1413.36s)]
*  to the T and probably inventing some new chapters in it. Wow. [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=1417.1999999999998s)]
*  And he got to see it all. [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=1420.4799999999998s)]
*  We had to see so many cool places and he got to meet so many of his heroes. [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=1421.52s)]
*  He was just using me as a stepping stone, he claimed, to get into the WWE. [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=1424.6s)]
*  That was his passion was wrestling. [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=1429.28s)]
*  I was like, really? Yeah, I was like, I get it. [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=1431.6s)]
*  But I'm like, well, and then he got to do all this stuff. [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=1434.1599999999999s)]
*  You know, Vince McMahon took him under his weight. [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=1436.6799999999998s)]
*  He got to do all the stuff with all his favorite wrestlers. [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=1438.6s)]
*  And that's just it was so fortunate. [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=1440.6s)]
*  Luckily, not luckily, but fortunately, he did pass away at home, which, [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=1443.04s)]
*  you know, it would have been just who was already devastated enough. [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=1447.92s)]
*  But if that would happen on the road. Oh, yeah. [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=1450.68s)]
*  I guess there's no way. But you know. [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=1453.3999999999999s)]
*  And where do you even put somebody, I guess, if you're traveling? [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=1454.96s)]
*  I guess you like I guess you just leave him at the hospital. [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=1457.3999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, it was. [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=1460.44s)]
*  It was. Yeah, it was a unique situation. [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=1461.52s)]
*  Like one time he forgot his pills in Cincinnati. [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=1463.2s)]
*  Mm hmm. He's like, you got to take me fucking home. [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=1466.3999999999999s)]
*  I'm like, dude, let me call your dad. [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=1469.08s)]
*  And if we have to get you back, we'll cancel the show and figure out. [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=1471.04s)]
*  But let me go. Don't call my fucking dad. [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=1473.6s)]
*  I'm calling your dad because he kind of, you know, his mom and dad were great. [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=1475.84s)]
*  But, you know, he was on it on his health stuff and what he needed to do. [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=1479.84s)]
*  Yeah, it was his mother, his whole family. [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=1483.32s)]
*  And his dad's like, no, he'll be OK. [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=1485.28s)]
*  Just ask to eat like two bottles of Tums. [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=1487.1599999999999s)]
*  He needs this calcium thing or something like that. [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=1489.8799999999999s)]
*  So I'm like, he goes, take me home. [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=1492.08s)]
*  I go, I just talked to your dad. [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=1494.28s)]
*  All you have to do is eat two bottles of Tums. [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=1495.72s)]
*  Fuck you, man. Take me home. [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=1497.52s)]
*  I'm like, we're not going home. We're doing the show. [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=1499.0s)]
*  So we got two bottles of Tums and he sat there and motherfucked me [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=1501.68s)]
*  through those two bottles of Tums. I'm like, Joey, eat the fuck. [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=1505.08s)]
*  He's like, fuck you. [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=1507.4s)]
*  You're a fucking asshole. [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=1509.68s)]
*  I'm like, eat the goddamn Tums, Joey. [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=1511.0s)]
*  Shut the fuck up and quit complaining. [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=1513.04s)]
*  Eat the fucking Tums, Joey. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=1515.28s)]
*  I wish we had that on video. It's pretty funny. [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=1518.6000000000001s)]
*  Oh, there's got to be nothing this because, yeah, they say if you feed [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=1521.04s)]
*  if you feed [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=1525.68s)]
*  one of those things, if you feed them to a seagull, they'll blow up. [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=1528.96s)]
*  Yeah, I think so. I remember hearing that. [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=1531.8s)]
*  I think that was Roll-Aids or something. [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=1533.28s)]
*  Yeah, they say if you feed. [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=1534.8400000000001s)]
*  Yeah, they also sell the same thing. [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=1536.32s)]
*  Yeah. You used to say if you feed Alka-Seltzer to a seagull, they'll blow up. [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=1538.1200000000001s)]
*  So, um, yeah, I never tried that. [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=1541.8s)]
*  I guess that would definitely up my that was my Steve. [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=1545.88s)]
*  Never tried it. [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=1548.32s)]
*  You fed 200 Tums to a little person, but that's fucking way crazy. [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=1549.24s)]
*  It didn't blow up. [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=1553.8s)]
*  Does it really explode in seagull? [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=1557.2s)]
*  I bet that you think that happens or not. [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=1558.68s)]
*  That guy did it. [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=1560.76s)]
*  Who would mind a seagull blowing up outside of like PETA? [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=1562.28s)]
*  Yeah, let's watch it. Seagulls are useless. [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=1565.16s)]
*  You can't eat them. [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=1568.1200000000001s)]
*  I guess you could. [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=1569.44s)]
*  I've never had it. Desperate times require desperate measures. [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=1570.64s)]
*  Oh, I'd eat them. I'd have some seagull. [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=1572.96s)]
*  Fried seagull. [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=1575.0800000000002s)]
*  I can't believe they don't have it, actually. [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=1576.52s)]
*  Well, they eat them somewhere. I guarantee it. [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=1578.5600000000002s)]
*  Does something really happen to this seagull or is this just? [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=1580.68s)]
*  They rope you in. [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=1583.68s)]
*  Do you see a lot of these Internet things? [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=1584.48s)]
*  Because you know a lot about the Internet from doing this, I'm sure. [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=1585.76s)]
*  At some level, like. [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=1588.8s)]
*  And what I've understood, the friend of mine runs YouTube music. [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=1590.3200000000002s)]
*  And I was trying to talk to him about this, but he moved to London. [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=1593.6000000000001s)]
*  We're reconnecting. [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=1596.0800000000002s)]
*  But you want to keep people watching for you get paid more [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=1599.0s)]
*  like if they watch longer, correct? [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=1601.68s)]
*  Yeah, I think on some clips, I know you get paid more if they see the ads. [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=1604.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=1608.0s)]
*  Because because we make actually pretty good money from music videos [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=1608.48s)]
*  on there now that I'm doing everything independent. [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=1612.1200000000001s)]
*  It's pretty interesting for me. [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=1614.3600000000001s)]
*  You know, it's not really a money thing anymore. [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=1615.8s)]
*  Like the early years of trying to, you know, bank money. [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=1617.76s)]
*  But it's kind of interesting to watch all this stuff and have direct access to it. [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=1621.6s)]
*  When you're with major labels, it was pretty hard to dig for and find. [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=1625.36s)]
*  Like it was just audits. [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=1628.8s)]
*  I mean, every audit would find, you know, 200 to like one point five million dollars. [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=1630.72s)]
*  You just forgot like to pay me like a million dollars. [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=1636.44s)]
*  Like, it's crazy. [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=1639.28s)]
*  It's crazy how much they hide. [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=1640.72s)]
*  Yeah, I can't believe you're performing out there in Gunza. [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=1642.8799999999999s)]
*  I mean, it's just cool. It's just like, yeah, it's like an off the beaten [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=1644.76s)]
*  path. And that's the first one of the seven festivals. [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=1647.6s)]
*  I think it's rock the country. [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=1651.1999999999998s)]
*  Then there's the rodeo we're doing in AT&T Stadium, which is going to be very interesting. [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=1652.3999999999999s)]
*  The rodeo. Where is that at? [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=1657.32s)]
*  Arlington, their home of the Cowboys. [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=1658.8s)]
*  We're doing a team's rodeo. [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=1661.28s)]
*  So, you know, rodeo has always been like like bull riding. [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=1662.9199999999998s)]
*  Just used to be single events. [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=1665.7199999999998s)]
*  People are just competing against each other. [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=1666.9599999999998s)]
*  It's timed. [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=1668.4399999999998s)]
*  So the PBR put together team bull riding. [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=1670.04s)]
*  We're now you have like, you know, a Nashville team, a Kansas City outlaws. [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=1672.4399999999998s)]
*  And so you get to root for your home team as a group of riders. [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=1676.52s)]
*  Yeah, I remember you and I were talking about this. [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=1679.16s)]
*  Were you going to own a team? [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=1680.6s)]
*  I was looking into buying a team. [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=1681.92s)]
*  Yes, I went very deep. [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=1683.24s)]
*  A lot of due diligence down there. [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=1685.12s)]
*  But then what is it like with the it was it was about 20 million bucks. [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=1686.36s)]
*  But and they're only growing bigger and bigger. [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=1690.92s)]
*  But so I came up with Sean Gleason, he's the CEO of the PBR. [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=1693.56s)]
*  We decided to go. I go. [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=1698.04s)]
*  I love bull riding, but I love rodeos. [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=1699.52s)]
*  There's a little more action entertainment. [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=1701.8s)]
*  I love to watch the Ropers. [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=1703.76s)]
*  The rodeo is so much fun. [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=1705.0s)]
*  Yeah, girls ride barrel racing, bucking saddle, [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=1706.0s)]
*  Brock riders likes. [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=1709.32s)]
*  But I'm like, and so he goes, what if we did a team thing with rodeo? [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=1710.4s)]
*  We'll put together six teams, which we came up with names. [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=1714.28s)]
*  It's a rock and road. [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=1716.76s)]
*  You see, I like the Jokers, the Sledgehammers, the Misty Mountain. [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=1717.56s)]
*  So has that started yet? [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=1720.44s)]
*  No, this is only one event this year where we're going to have like [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=1721.76s)]
*  head to head competition. [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=1724.72s)]
*  So like Ropers are going to be going against each other. [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=1725.88s)]
*  Barrel racers are coming against each other. [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=1727.8s)]
*  That's what I want. I want to be a part of a team. [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=1729.48s)]
*  Do we found a little person like a man? [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=1731.72s)]
*  And I think we got two of them that do the Matador things [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=1734.0s)]
*  with like a little Mexican bowl. [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=1737.0s)]
*  Oh, wow. They're dressed up like. [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=1738.96s)]
*  Yeah, that's beautiful. [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=1740.64s)]
*  We want entertainment going the whole time. [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=1741.04s)]
*  Yeah. I'm going to open the show. [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=1742.88s)]
*  I'm trying to put together something really special, like [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=1744.16s)]
*  like an award show would be. [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=1747.0s)]
*  Yeah. With some other guests like putting something [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=1748.12s)]
*  because we're going to be televised. [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=1750.52s)]
*  Well, rodeo is extremely. [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=1751.96s)]
*  I mean, what do you do? You have to do anything. [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=1754.0s)]
*  Rodeo is awesome. [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=1756.04s)]
*  Like when I go to the rodeo, like I went to the Franklin Rodeo last year. [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=1757.52s)]
*  Let me get to my big dick moment. OK. [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=1760.64s)]
*  So rather than by the bull riding team, we put together this team series. [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=1762.32s)]
*  All these teams where I'm playing the rodeo, I'm in charge of, you know, [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=1768.36s)]
*  the entertainment. We didn't really have a budget. [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=1770.72s)]
*  So I said, I'll play it. [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=1772.24s)]
*  It's a long term money play to me. [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=1773.72s)]
*  So rather than buy a bull riding team, I own half the league. [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=1775.0s)]
*  Oh, wow. Damn. [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=1779.4399999999998s)]
*  So if we can get this to work and people think it's a great event, [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=1782.6s)]
*  we can make it fun and then, you know, we can start to sell teams [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=1785.24s)]
*  to prospective owners, you know, do you keep me? [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=1788.52s)]
*  I would I think because I love the rodeo and it was my favorite thing [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=1791.0s)]
*  I've done in the past year. Yeah, they are. [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=1794.44s)]
*  You know, it's just the last great, at least in the times we're living in right now. [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=1796.48s)]
*  It's the last great American. [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=1799.8s)]
*  I would call it non woke sport. Yeah. [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=1802.28s)]
*  You know, I mean, where everything's pro American, we're going to stand, [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=1804.92s)]
*  take our hats off for the flag, probably have an invitation, you know, [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=1807.36s)]
*  pursuing a little while and have some rock and roll and have some crazy fun. [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=1810.08s)]
*  But, you know, it's just like there's not going to be in this. [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=1812.84s)]
*  We're being very protective of this league that we want to keep it that way. [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=1815.0s)]
*  Yeah, we don't want to let in bad actors who want to like [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=1817.96s)]
*  introduce D.E.I. and all this shit, you know, where we. [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=1820.44s)]
*  Yeah, you have a gender neutral bathroom for the horses. Yeah. [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=1823.76s)]
*  Yeah, you can't just throw some Malaysian or somebody on a horse [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=1828.52s)]
*  just because ethnicity, you know, it's like you got to want to keep it [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=1832.04s)]
*  quality riders, people that know what they're doing. [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=1836.28s)]
*  And hopefully the team thinks creates a little more drama. [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=1839.3600000000001s)]
*  You know, we don't know what's going to happen because no one's ever done it. [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=1841.4s)]
*  I think they're doing trials this week. [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=1843.96s)]
*  They got a, you know, ranch in Texas where they're trying some of this to see, like, [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=1845.44s)]
*  how close can we put the barrels? [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=1849.44s)]
*  We don't want anyone to get hurt, obviously, but we want to create some drama. [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=1851.56s)]
*  Dude, I would love I even just think the teams going against each other [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=1855.0s)]
*  would be fascinating. I mean, I think it'd be great. [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=1858.24s)]
*  Well, it's always great to have a team. [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=1860.1599999999999s)]
*  You know, these are all just teams we created now. [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=1861.28s)]
*  But, you know, when you go to root for your favorite football team [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=1863.04s)]
*  or favorite, you know, baseball or hockey team, like, be nice to have this. [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=1866.92s)]
*  Like the bull riding teams now, you're as a city, you're rooting for this team. [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=1870.44s)]
*  You know, so we're trying to create that, which I can't believe nobody's [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=1874.56s)]
*  thought of yet in rodeo. [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=1877.48s)]
*  I love that. Yeah, man, I would love to be a if I could get a group [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=1878.72s)]
*  together and be a part owner or something, that'd be fascinating, [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=1882.16s)]
*  especially with with rodeo. [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=1884.48s)]
*  Well, I told him, I said, I think that's a big angle on this is not to just have, [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=1885.92s)]
*  like, you know, there's great owners in the bull riding from the Johnny Morris, [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=1889.32s)]
*  as you know, and Richard Childers and people like that. [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=1893.0s)]
*  I go, what I'd like to employ for these rodeo team sales is that they bring in [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=1895.24s)]
*  certain celebrities at certain levels that are into this. [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=1899.92s)]
*  Like if some rich guys of company want to like, you know, my buddies [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=1902.08s)]
*  that own the Kansas City Owl as they started bad boy mowers, you know, [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=1905.88s)]
*  made a grip of money and bought the team down there. Great guys. [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=1909.4s)]
*  But and they want to do like maybe a little deal with me to have a little piece [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=1912.2s)]
*  of the team to add that, you know, what, you know, people like that [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=1915.44s)]
*  bring to it, showing up to the events, throwing their ideas in there is like, [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=1918.1200000000001s)]
*  yeah, I'm going to have people like you and in the sports, you know, [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=1921.24s)]
*  entertainment, you know, music world involved with each team. [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=1924.8000000000002s)]
*  So we can kind of create a little bit of that shit show. [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=1927.6000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, get some extra buzz. [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=1929.68s)]
*  We'll definitely keep going. Thanks, bro. [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=1930.88s)]
*  Um, dude, I heard a rumor. [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=1933.4399999999998s)]
*  This is a crazy rumor that I love rumors. [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=1935.84s)]
*  Do you that you pay? [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=1939.04s)]
*  That you would call like Walmart at Christmas and pay off the layaway for. [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=1943.28s)]
*  I did it once. People's gifts. Did you? [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=1947.72s)]
*  Well, I did it because I saw Tyler Perry did it. Oh, he did. [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=1949.72s)]
*  And I was like, what a great move. [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=1952.48s)]
*  Because I'm always looking for things to do. [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=1954.32s)]
*  And there's some things you do, a lot of things just keep them quiet. [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=1955.9199999999998s)]
*  You know, that's not what you do it for. [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=1959.1599999999999s)]
*  But then there's times where I'm conflicted because I know if I do [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=1960.6s)]
*  something that's public, it might influence other people to get on board [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=1963.4s)]
*  for that and you could do even better. [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=1966.84s)]
*  So that was one thing that Tyler Perry did. [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=1968.72s)]
*  And I thought that was what a great idea, because people don't know. [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=1970.28s)]
*  So just my little neighborhood here in White's Creek, Tennessee, [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=1973.8799999999999s)]
*  there's a Walmart right by me. [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=1977.08s)]
*  That's my go to Walmart and the Lowe's right there. [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=1978.4s)]
*  You know, they're just conveniently located. [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=1981.08s)]
*  And if I can't get it at Walmart or Lowe's, I probably don't need it. [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=1982.96s)]
*  So, yeah, I had somebody go over there and I was like, [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=1986.28s)]
*  it was kind of a little bit of a nail biter. [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=1988.68s)]
*  It was it wasn't about the money, but you don't know what it's going to be. [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=1990.28s)]
*  It's a Christmas time. [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=1993.16s)]
*  I'm like, go find out right now what they owe on their layaways. [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=1994.0s)]
*  Wow. And you're like, is it going to be like 300 grand? [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=1997.24s)]
*  Is it going to be, you know, 10 grand? [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=2000.76s)]
*  It was like it was like 85 grand. OK. [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=2002.24s)]
*  So that was cool because I live in the neighborhood, too. [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=2004.68s)]
*  So I just put a little I had him put a little card in there. [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=2006.4s)]
*  Just said, you know, Merry Christmas from your neighbor, Kid Rock. [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=2008.28s)]
*  So people's layaways are paid and people were, you know, excited about it [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=2011.04s)]
*  and felt great. And it was something, you know, you can't write that off [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=2013.92s)]
*  like you can if you give to another 501 C3. Right. [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=2016.64s)]
*  This is just straight cash. [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=2019.8799999999999s)]
*  So to give that 80 away, I had to generate 160. Yeah. [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=2021.16s)]
*  So it's not like, you know, the most charity stuff. [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=2024.4s)]
*  But man, it was it was a great feeling. [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=2026.4s)]
*  I was proud of that one. [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=2028.64s)]
*  Um, yeah, that's my life. [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=2030.28s)]
*  Friends, you know, Randy Gerber, one of my best friends, Cindy Crawford, [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=2031.52s)]
*  they did it in a place like in Compton or something. [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=2034.32s)]
*  And I think there was an NFL coach who did it somewhere else. [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=2037.0s)]
*  Like so what Tyler Perry started kind of caught on that year [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=2040.16s)]
*  and helped a lot of people out. [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=2043.0s)]
*  And I think this was kind of during the recession. Oh, nice. [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=2044.08s)]
*  That's a great story, man. [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=2047.56s)]

*  Tell me that this story is fascinating to me, dude, this story, [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=2082.52s)]
*  because your brother lost a limb. [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=2085.44s)]
*  And how did it happen when you were kids? [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=2087.68s)]
*  He was seven years old. [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=2090.8799999999997s)]
*  I was four and riding up on my dad's brush hog. [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=2092.04s)]
*  God rest his soul. [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=2096.24s)]
*  And we were coming up the hill and it started raining a little bit. [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=2097.24s)]
*  And he was trying to cut some grass on the way up the hill. [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=2101.3199999999997s)]
*  And I don't know. [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=2104.7599999999998s)]
*  I can't remember so young. [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=2105.68s)]
*  Were we fucking around a little bit like grabbing at apples or something? [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=2106.6s)]
*  But he slipped off, fell underneath and that just took his leg right off. [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=2109.04s)]
*  It was a conundrum. [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=2114.2s)]
*  But I was so young and he was so young. [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=2115.12s)]
*  That's like basically we grew up not really. [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=2117.48s)]
*  I don't ever remember him really with two legs. [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=2119.08s)]
*  And he could do anything. [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=2121.3599999999997s)]
*  The fuck are golfs. [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=2122.24s)]
*  Oh, yeah. One leg with with no like he just drops his crutches, his balance. [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=2123.3599999999997s)]
*  Like that's the first thing Trump says to me every time I see him or talk to him, [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=2127.68s)]
*  which is a lot. [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=2131.3199999999997s)]
*  He's like, oh, your fucking brother hit the greatest shot. [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=2133.0s)]
*  Well, first time of golfing with Trump, I take my brother, my dad. [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=2136.04s)]
*  He's president. [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=2139.44s)]
*  So it's like it's a shit show and it's a little nerve wracking. [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=2140.16s)]
*  You know, this is before we became really good friends, you know, and you're like, [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=2143.12s)]

*  Your brother's out there. [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=2148.68s)]
*  You have one leg. [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=2149.76s)]
*  And Trump goes, what happened to your brother? [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=2150.8s)]
*  And I told him the story. [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=2152.08s)]
*  I go, you should see him hit a golf ball. [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=2153.08s)]
*  I go, this is a lot of pressure, too. [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=2155.04s)]
*  So Trump goes, Billy, come hit a ball. [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=2157.32s)]
*  My fucking brother is very stoned. [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=2159.4s)]
*  He goes and grabs Trump's driver without even asking him. [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=2161.72s)]
*  Grabs it, gets over there, smokes it down the fairway like 220. [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=2165.08s)]
*  And Trump's like, I want to change partners. [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=2170.0s)]
*  Billy. [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=2172.96s)]

*  Because, yeah, I remember when I first met you, I'm talking about the podcast. [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=2761.76s)]
*  You're like, I don't, you know, you said maybe one day [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=2764.92s)]
*  I'm going to do I might do one with Tucker sometime soon [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=2768.52s)]
*  and then maybe sometime after that, I did that to promote my last album and TORC. [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=2771.92s)]
*  Those were my last big tour that I did for the Unforeseen Future. [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=2775.8s)]
*  I don't know. That was last year, right? [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=2778.8s)]
*  It's a couple of years ago, two or three. [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=2780.16s)]
*  Like maybe three. [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=2781.44s)]
*  I can't remember. [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=2783.4s)]
*  I did like 30 shows and put an album out, but all I did was that thing with Tucker. [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=2784.56s)]
*  I sold out the whole tour and like for where I'm at without promoting records, [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=2788.88s)]
*  like I don't go to the radio, any of that stuff anymore. [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=2792.88s)]
*  Just kind of put them up for people to dig what I do and for myself. [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=2795.2000000000003s)]
*  Yeah. Love to make music. [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=2798.0s)]
*  That's what I do. So I was like, fuck. [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=2799.52s)]
*  That sold out the whole tour. [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=2802.6s)]
*  I was like, and it became years ago when the Internet started coming. [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=2803.56s)]
*  Because remember, I came up without all this shit. [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=2807.52s)]
*  Yes. Amen. [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=2809.08s)]
*  Without cell phones and stuff. [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=2809.76s)]
*  Whenever I was getting my groove on and starting to make money and being successful. [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=2810.96s)]
*  And everything had turned into a gotcha moment. [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=2813.88s)]
*  And there's nobody like gotcha to get better than fucking me. [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=2817.2000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, I'm fucking idiot. [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=2820.92s)]
*  You ask me a question, I'll just start fucking diarrhea of the mouth all day long. [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=2822.48s)]
*  Yeah. So everything would be like, oh, it turned. [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=2826.04s)]
*  It's like nothing about music. [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=2828.72s)]
*  Like all of us just like kid rock. [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=2830.2s)]
*  This dumbass said this. [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=2832.28s)]
*  It talks shit about so and so. [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=2833.52s)]
*  Blah, blah, blah. [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=2835.0s)]
*  And I was like, I'm done with it. [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=2836.12s)]
*  I don't fucking don't need the headache. Yeah. [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=2837.04s)]
*  And I'm kind of getting back into it. [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=2839.44s)]
*  Yeah. Just because I have these shows to promote that I have a vested interest in. [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=2842.36s)]
*  I own half the rodeo. [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=2845.6s)]
*  Like, I really want to see these be successful. [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=2846.96s)]
*  So so wait. [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=2848.8s)]
*  So the ones that are on this tour coming up with the you and Jason Aldean tour, [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=2849.52s)]
*  that that will be the rodeo is attached to that. [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=2853.4s)]
*  No, that's separate. [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=2856.92s)]
*  But it's still like, you know, I've I've I have an ownership in these festivals. [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=2858.2s)]
*  Right. Perpetuity. [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=2861.6s)]
*  So if we make these successful and, you know, several years down the line, [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=2862.52s)]
*  if I'm not playing all of them, if it just becomes its own brand, rock the country, [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=2865.68s)]
*  then I get to be just involved in the background of trying to put good [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=2869.28s)]
*  experiences and good music together for other people. [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=2871.72s)]
*  And that kind of interests me more at this point. [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=2874.16s)]
*  You know, if I just want to make a dollar, I can just go out and book a tour. [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=2876.0s)]
*  I've been very blessed, you know, with hard work. [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=2879.08s)]
*  Number one, a work ethic that nobody's fucking with me work wise. [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=2882.52s)]
*  And then, you know, have for people like what I do, it's, you know, it's a show. [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=2886.48s)]
*  It's an entertainment show, show, show. [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=2890.52s)]
*  And you'll see that. [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=2893.48s)]
*  But now I'm more interested in trying to create something, whether it's, [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=2895.3199999999997s)]
*  you know, something that you have ownership or legacy legacy things [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=2898.56s)]
*  for my son or my grandchildren or things like that. [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=2902.12s)]
*  And it's a lot more work, but it's more interesting. [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=2905.2799999999997s)]
*  It gets me out of bed, wanted, like, you know, just do better and kick ass that day. [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=2908.08s)]
*  Yeah, I like that, man. A new challenge. [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=2911.7599999999998s)]
*  Yeah, it's like more challenging. How can I figure this out? [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=2913.48s)]
*  And also restoring some tradition like we've let go of a lot of tradition. [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=2916.24s)]
*  Like the media has beaten down a lot of American tradition, [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=2921.0s)]
*  especially in the past five years. [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=2924.0s)]
*  And there's a big portion of this country that's underserved. [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=2927.48s)]
*  As you know, this is why Duck Dynasty and Yellowstone are so huge. [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=2930.2799999999997s)]
*  Things of that nature, like there's this column conservatives, [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=2933.92s)]
*  whatever you want, maybe middle of the road, right leaning, who just don't have like [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=2937.12s)]
*  I'm like every time I get into a series, you know, I don't watch a ton of TV. [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=2941.16s)]
*  Probably watch a little too much Fox News and I should. [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=2945.16s)]
*  But I don't watch a ton of TV. [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=2947.4s)]
*  I kind of would rather spend my time doing more productive things. [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=2949.48s)]
*  But I like to unwind and shut my computer down for an hour at the end of the night. [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=2951.96s)]
*  And it's like and I don't care if there's somebody gay, somebody trans, [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=2955.68s)]
*  like if it makes sense to be in a show. [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=2958.8399999999997s)]
*  It's like every fucking one of these things you put on, it's like [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=2961.0s)]
*  comes the transfer. So I'm like, for what? [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=2964.68s)]
*  Are they like the greatest actor? OK, great. [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=2967.12s)]
*  I'm like, no, no, it's just so they're, you know, so they have that [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=2969.56s)]
*  fuck off. Hollywood has their stupid balance of bullshit or whatever they're trying to do. [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=2972.96s)]
*  I'm like, you just don't have to like insert it fucking everywhere. [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=2976.7999999999997s)]
*  Well, and it just they don't they think it's not obvious to people. [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=2980.92s)]
*  But then also like Hollywood, like click on a same. [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=2983.4s)]
*  There's only eight thousand things you could stream like, OK, I'm not [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=2987.52s)]
*  going to have to watch Alexander the Great with two dudes like, you know, getting down [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=2991.0s)]
*  just for the. [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=2994.4799999999996s)]
*  Well, maybe that would make sense, because I think that dude was gay or something. [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=2995.4799999999996s)]
*  That might make sense, actually. [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=2998.2s)]
*  And if you're that's the storyline. [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=2999.56s)]
*  OK, boom. That makes sense. [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=3001.2s)]
*  Yeah, but I think I think also if you were living in a castle or something, you would. [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=3004.9599999999996s)]
*  Did I design a castle? Your own. [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=3011.16s)]
*  But if build one like a small, more of a guest type house, like four floors. [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=3013.64s)]
*  But I love architecture and interior design and all that shit. [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=3017.9199999999996s)]
*  Really? I designed a castle. [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=3021.0s)]
*  I've showed you some time. [[00:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=3023.24s)]
*  When did I'm when did you like when did you realize that like you loved business [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=3024.4399999999996s)]
*  as much because it's interesting because there's one thing to be entertainer, right, [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=3030.9599999999996s)]
*  to have that ability and to be blessed with the opportunity to entertain people. [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=3037.4399999999996s)]
*  Absolutely. That's rare. [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=3042.2s)]
*  But then like, when did you kind of switch that like, [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=3043.9599999999996s)]
*  were you always in the business mindset or did that sort of switch at some point? [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=3047.24s)]
*  Or did that become like an added thing? [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=3051.52s)]
*  Like, OK, I can also be a businessman. [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=3053.56s)]
*  Does that make sense? Kind of had to be one. [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=3057.2400000000002s)]
*  You know, it was in my blood more than most for my dad being a success. [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=3059.36s)]
*  He was, you know, put himself through Michigan State College [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=3062.64s)]
*  and graduated top of his business class, you know, and then started one of the top [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=3065.44s)]
*  50 Lincoln Mercury dealerships in the country, which I'm extremely proud of. [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=3069.64s)]
*  Yeah, I love to see his motherfuckers online like, oh, he was a rich kid. [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=3073.36s)]
*  I'm like, yeah, fucking awesome. [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=3076.12s)]
*  Yeah, fucking awesome. [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=3078.44s)]
*  I wouldn't call ourselves rich. [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=3080.9199999999996s)]
*  We were, you know, upper end of middle class, [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=3082.08s)]
*  because now I've seen what rich really is. [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=3084.44s)]
*  And we weren't. But we were better than most. Right. [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=3086.3199999999997s)]
*  It was great. And I will never apologize that to fucking anybody. [[00:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=3089.2s)]
*  It's an American dream. [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=3092.56s)]
*  I had two great fucking parents that worked their asses off. [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=3093.64s)]
*  Yes, we had a pool and fucking horses and shit like that. [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=3096.2799999999997s)]
*  Oh, yeah. And I had to cut the grass and I worked my ass off. [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=3099.64s)]
*  Like, but I think I had it in my blood for my dad, number one. [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=3102.04s)]
*  And had great him and uncle's people around me. [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=3105.6s)]
*  But it was I had to be good at business [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=3108.24s)]
*  because I was never the most talented guy in the room. [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=3109.8399999999997s)]
*  I was not the greatest singer. I was not the greatest player. [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=3112.68s)]
*  I was always one of the best DJs, things like that. [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=3115.12s)]
*  But I knew how to put it all together. [[00:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=3117.68s)]
*  But I had to be shrewd and marketing and things like this. [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=3119.2799999999997s)]
*  And I had to really work harder at these talents to be, [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=3122.12s)]
*  you know, to be able to get my hand in the cookie jar of the upper [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=3126.12s)]
*  the upper scale of talent, the upper end of talent wise, you know, [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=3129.2799999999997s)]
*  which which I've gotten there. [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=3132.12s)]
*  Some would, you know, arguably gotten there. [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=3134.16s)]
*  It depends who you ask. [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=3136.76s)]
*  So, you know, it's kind of out of necessity. [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=3138.56s)]
*  But it's very interesting to to dig in. [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=3140.44s)]
*  And sometimes it's it's like the music business, the actual record part. [[00:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=3142.84s)]
*  Like. That is just a bummer. [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=3146.92s)]
*  It's like what's happening. [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=3150.84s)]
*  It's the most dirty fucking business. [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=3152.64s)]
*  The porn industry is more straight up than the music business. [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=3154.64s)]
*  It is the dirtiest fucking business on the planet. [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=3157.92s)]
*  And that can be [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=3160.6s)]
*  quite upsetting in a turn off when you're in that world dealing with it. [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=3162.8s)]
*  I've seen behind, you know, I've seen the wizard. [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=3166.08s)]
*  I know what he looks like, you know. [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=3168.2799999999997s)]
*  So and with with like when you say something like that, [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=3171.12s)]
*  like with the music, like was there ever stuff [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=3175.3199999999997s)]
*  we recorded that you couldn't release? [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=3177.64s)]
*  I know that happens to a lot of my friends. [[00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=3179.24s)]
*  No, there were certain things I had to change like early on with like samples, [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=3181.6s)]
*  sampling people like when I put my first album out with Jive [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=3184.96s)]
*  when I was 18 years old, you know, that too short produced a few songs [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=3188.24s)]
*  and D Nice and Chuck Nice and three times dope. [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=3192.48s)]
*  And I used every crazy set like shattered the Rolling Stones. [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=3195.52s)]
*  They were like, and I'm I'm rapping. [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=3199.64s)]
*  I'm pretty much like rapping, like Suck My Dick and like five times [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=3201.32s)]
*  every song in the album. [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=3204.36s)]
*  Like there's nothing clean about this record at all. [[00:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=3205.44s)]
*  You needed a blow job. [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=3208.0s)]
*  Well, you know, I was 18. [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=3209.12s)]
*  Oh, dude, yeah. [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=3211.28s)]
*  Dirty and gangster rap was the thing, and I wanted to be in the middle of it. [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=3212.48s)]
*  But, you know, so there was a lot of samples like Jim Crochet. [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=3215.32s)]
*  They were like, you're not using Jim Crochet or rapping on dirty songs. [[00:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=3217.88s)]
*  So things like that. But no, there hasn't been. [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=3221.12s)]
*  I mean, I made a lot of songs. [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=3222.92s)]
*  It's hard to think through them all. Yeah. On the spot. [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=3225.92s)]
*  What was it? [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=3228.8s)]
*  Your dad passed away not long ago, man. I'm sorry. Thank you. [[00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=3230.64s)]
*  Sorry for that. 15th. What kind of guy was he? [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=3233.36s)]
*  It was awesome. He was he was a character, man. [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=3236.88s)]
*  Was he hard work and patriotic son of a bitch like love drink beer, work hard. [[00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=3239.4s)]
*  You know, as he'd say, he said, we'll drink a case of beer on Friday. [[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=3244.7200000000003s)]
*  And that's just getting warm for Saturday. [[00:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=3247.36s)]
*  You know, but he loved music, rock and roll. [[00:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=3249.56s)]
*  And yeah, a lot of country shit. [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=3252.24s)]
*  But he was great. [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=3254.3199999999997s)]
*  Of course, we butted heads when I was young because he had no. [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=3255.4799999999996s)]
*  He's like, what the fuck is this kid doing? [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=3258.68s)]
*  I'm the only one didn't go to college, didn't want anything to do with his business. [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=3260.68s)]
*  And you look like the complete opposite of college, too. Yeah, exactly. [[00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=3265.04s)]
*  But I'm basically running around the hood, you know, in my turntables, [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=3269.12s)]
*  DJ and a rap and a breakdance and all this shit. [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=3272.3199999999997s)]
*  And it was like, you know, you could ask him if he was still here. [[00:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=3274.3999999999996s)]
*  My mom would tell you, he's like, we were worried about Bobby. [[00:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=3276.9599999999996s)]
*  Like, we're going to have to take care of him the rest of his life. [[00:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=3279.12s)]
*  And you think they'd be worried about the guy with one leg. [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=3282.52s)]
*  Right. No, no. Yeah, exactly. [[00:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=3285.3199999999997s)]
*  But then they're like, fuck, dude, this guy needs to lose a leg, too. [[00:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=3287.24s)]
*  Yeah, he needs to lose them both. [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=3290.9599999999996s)]
*  Probably take an arm with them, too. [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=3293.68s)]
*  Wow, man. Did they were at first, did they? [[00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=3297.16s)]
*  At what point did they kind of tilt? [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=3300.7999999999997s)]
*  Because I'm sure you know what point when I made money. [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=3302.4399999999996s)]
*  Is that it? Yeah. [[00:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=3305.24s)]
*  Yeah. But then he was so proud of me, like he came to some of my last shows [[00:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=3306.64s)]
*  in Detroit last year. I bought him this fucking pink Versace shorts. [[00:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=3309.8s)]
*  I get like four or five grand. [[00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=3314.7200000000003s)]

*  Yeah. And he got in a wheelchair. [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=3319.32s)]
*  You know, his cancer was getting bad and stuff, but he wouldn't miss the show. [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=3320.6400000000003s)]

*  And my son leaned on him for so much advice. [[00:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=3345.4s)]
*  And now he's kicking ass, you know, working for this company, cracking [[00:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=3348.52s)]

*  So I walk into the arena for the ceremony first. [[01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=3615.96s)]
*  I know a judge singing. [[01:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=3619.36s)]

*  And then they were walking around. [[01:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=3628.28s)]
*  The funny part was visiting her classrooms, your classroom teachers [[01:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=3629.6400000000003s)]
*  show me different things around the school and like the whole time, [[01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=3632.6000000000004s)]
*  like you're like a lot of other granddads are come up and like, [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=3634.92s)]

*  Yeah. I'm like, it happens quite a bit that afternoon. [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=3642.2000000000003s)]
*  And I'm going to take my granddaughter to lunch after she's like, [[01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=3646.08s)]

*  Well, it's well, the thing is, there's so many people, [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=3656.64s)]
*  I think for years also were afraid of losing their jobs, especially in Hollywood. [[01:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=3659.16s)]
*  If they can set anything that was openly conservative. [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=3662.96s)]
*  You know, Hollywood gets his carte blanche or has over the years [[01:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=3668.88s)]
*  to make fun of like the only person they would make fun of is white males mostly. [[01:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=3672.3199999999997s)]
*  And so I think that's where they lost a lot of people. [[01:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=3678.7599999999998s)]
*  That's where they like started to ruin comedy. [[01:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=3681.08s)]
*  Oh, they now it's kind of coming like people have had enough of it, [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=3684.08s)]
*  whether you're liberal, conservative, whatever. [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=3686.96s)]
*  I think the majority of just common sense thinking people are like, [[01:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=3688.7999999999997s)]
*  yeah, this has gone too far. [[01:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=3694.04s)]
*  Yeah. Like when you can't joke about it, because you've talked about it with you. [[01:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=3695.3199999999997s)]
*  Yeah. You know, you were like, and you know, me, remember, I'm like, I drew a line. [[01:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=3698.36s)]
*  I go like, here's the line for you in comedy. [[01:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=3701.72s)]
*  I'm like, and you're kind of standing right behind it, right on the edge. [[01:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=3703.7999999999997s)]
*  I go, I would employ you to fucking jump about three feet past the line. [[01:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=3706.88s)]
*  Like, just say what's funny. [[01:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=3711.64s)]
*  And if people can't handle it, fuck them. [[01:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=3713.2799999999997s)]
*  Yeah. And I really didn't change. [[01:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=3715.36s)]
*  I've been I came out with fingers on my CDs, like running my mouth. [[01:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=3716.72s)]
*  It's like I always say and I've I've sound redundant probably, but I haven't changed. [[01:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=3721.52s)]
*  The times have changed. Yeah. [[01:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=3725.36s)]
*  I've been doing the same thing since day one. [[01:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=3726.96s)]
*  Did you know what? I think that's really true about you, [[01:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=3729.04s)]
*  because sometimes I think something you say, I'm like, [[01:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=3731.52s)]
*  it seems like the sometimes I'll be like, that seems kind of outdated. [[01:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=3734.84s)]
*  But the truth is just the times have changed. [[01:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=3738.52s)]
*  And there's probably things I maybe don't want to get blackout drunk [[01:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=3741.16s)]
*  and say at 53 years old or like, you know, like fucking act your age sometimes. [[01:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=3744.16s)]
*  But I'm like, I like to have a good time, too. [[01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=3749.6s)]
*  And like, you know, there's like there's several times and it's all out there [[01:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=3751.96s)]
*  for the taking or, yeah, fucked up. [[01:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=3755.7999999999997s)]
*  I should be on the honky tonk with fucking microphone. [[01:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=3758.4s)]
*  But I really don't give a shit to some people. [[01:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=3761.68s)]
*  It's probably interesting and fun. [[01:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=3764.3999999999996s)]
*  It's you know, it's not that I don't mean to say it. [[01:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=3765.8399999999997s)]
*  It's maybe that I should know. [[01:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=3767.7599999999998s)]
*  I don't know. Well, we've changed. [[01:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=3769.2799999999997s)]
*  It has changed over time, though. [[01:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=3771.0s)]
*  It's changed to like what people I mean, the same people own so much of the industry [[01:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=3772.24s)]
*  that it's like the same companies and everything that it's like you [[01:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=3776.68s)]
*  people have just been afraid to speak up. [[01:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=3781.12s)]
*  Well, their social standings. [[01:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=3783.48s)]
*  It could be their social standings. [[01:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=3785.3199999999997s)]
*  It could be their jobs and careers. [[01:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=3786.68s)]
*  Yeah. You know, I talked to a lot of the younger, [[01:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=3788.88s)]
*  especially in this town, country acts, things like that. [[01:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=3791.6000000000004s)]
*  So are being successful coming up. [[01:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=3793.56s)]
*  And, you know, if we get in talking, I'm like, look, I wouldn't employ [[01:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=3795.2000000000003s)]

*  You know, I'm not I've always said I don't give a shit about awards at any level. [[01:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=3803.6800000000003s)]
*  It was like, I don't need those fucking accolades. [[01:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=3807.76s)]
*  I don't want them. [[01:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=3809.6000000000004s)]
*  I'm not willing to play the politics or put the penises in my mouth to get them. [[01:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=3810.2000000000003s)]

*  But also, do you feel like at your level, once you have a certain level of money [[01:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=3873.4s)]
*  and you know you're going to be OK, it is easier to say what you want? [[01:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=3877.88s)]
*  Absolutely. Yeah. [[01:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=3881.88s)]

*  Brantley Gilbert, Travis Tritt, like Big and Rich with Gretchen Wilson. [[01:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=4177.28s)]
*  Like, wow. And a cast of other other people. [[01:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=4180.72s)]
*  And it just depends, you know, people just need to go to rock the country dot com. [[01:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=4183.24s)]
*  Because my buddy sent me, Trace sent me the other day, you know, our friend Trace [[01:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=4186.48s)]
*  sent me this thing. And he's like, dude, these tickets are misleading [[01:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=4190.0s)]
*  because it was saying like me and Hank and Jason were on both nights. [[01:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=4193.0s)]
*  And I'm like, fuck, I don't want that out there. [[01:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=4197.360000000001s)]
*  So I sent it to my partner's Premiere Entertainment. [[01:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=4199.4400000000005s)]
*  I'm like, hey, this is this is no good. [[01:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=4202.400000000001s)]
*  And he and he gets me back. He goes, we're on it. [[01:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=4204.56s)]
*  So I don't want to mislead people ever. Yeah. [[01:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=4207.4800000000005s)]
*  And boom, it was on StubHub. [[01:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=4209.4400000000005s)]
*  It's like a secondary ticket. [[01:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=4212.040000000001s)]
*  Oh, so they're lying over there scalping tickets like. [[01:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=4213.240000000001s)]
*  And if you go to those sites to buy, I'm like, God bless you. [[01:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=4216.040000000001s)]
*  But that's not responsible for that shit. [[01:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=4218.2s)]
*  You go to rock the country dot com and get the tickets for where we're trying [[01:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=4220.599999999999s)]
*  to sell them. And it has all the correct info. [[01:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=4223.599999999999s)]
*  I just like people to be aware of that when you're going on these secondary sites. [[01:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=4225.72s)]
*  You got to be aware of misinformation on anything. [[01:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=4229.32s)]
*  Yeah. People send me links. [[01:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=4231.96s)]
*  So like this ticket's two hundred and ten dollars. [[01:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=4233.12s)]
*  I'm like, well, I've never heard of that site. [[01:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=4235.12s)]
*  And if you go to this other site and some of the time, find the form, [[01:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=4237.599999999999s)]
*  you know, it's seventy dollars. [[01:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=4240.8s)]
*  OK, address this other thing that I've been wanting to put out there [[01:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=4242.0s)]
*  in the public and try to figure out a way to do it with. [[01:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=4244.72s)]
*  And it's been happening to a lot of people. [[01:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=4247.04s)]
*  This is I'd be surprised if it hasn't happened to you. Yeah. [[01:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=4248.96s)]
*  These women sending money to fake [[01:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=4252.2s)]
*  Kid Rock's Calm, this, that and the other. [[01:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=4255.64s)]
*  And I've had I can't tell you how many like either reach out. [[01:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=4257.6s)]
*  Kind of we had we had several of them. [[01:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=4261.12s)]
*  One lady showed up in my gate in a U-Haul truck with her dog, [[01:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=4262.76s)]
*  had sold her house and given her life savings of like thirty thousand dollars [[01:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=4266.8s)]
*  to some troll on the Internet saying I could. [[01:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=4270.08s)]
*  I would want it to be with her. [[01:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=4272.6s)]
*  But here's how they do it. It's pretty genius. [[01:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=4274.28s)]
*  They say like, you know, you know, me and Audrey, my fiance, [[01:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=4276.8s)]
*  we've been 17 years. [[01:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=4279.56s)]
*  So these bad actors get these people to respond. [[01:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=4280.72s)]
*  And then they say, listen, you know, I want to get to know you better. [[01:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=4283.360000000001s)]
*  And then they get them like kind of on the hook. [[01:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=4286.4400000000005s)]
*  Then they say, well, I'm getting divorced from Audrey and my money's tied up. [[01:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=4288.28s)]
*  So if you could just send me a little money to tie me over that time, [[01:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=4292.56s)]
*  then we can be together. [[01:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=4295.12s)]
*  And I know Kenny Chesney said it's happened to him. [[01:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=4297.08s)]
*  Even Uncle Cracker, it's happened to him. [[01:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=4299.08s)]
*  It's out there like people do not send fucking money over the Internet to anybody. [[01:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=4300.52s)]
*  Like, well, and then when they show up there, I'm like, [[01:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=4305.76s)]
*  there's nothing you can say if you were that naive to send [[01:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=4309.12s)]
*  fucking money to somebody like you think I'm on the Internet asking people for money. [[01:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=4311.96s)]
*  By the way, all you have to do is look and it's a fake website. [[01:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=4316.48s)]
*  Like at that point, there's no conversation to have. [[01:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=4319.76s)]
*  I just feel bad for them. [[01:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=4321.88s)]
*  What did you say when the lady showed up? Did you have any pets? [[01:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=4323.72s)]
*  I was in my, you know, security handled it. [[01:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=4326.16s)]
*  But it's happened. [[01:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=4329.88s)]
*  It hasn't happened once or twice or three or four times. [[01:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=4331.28s)]
*  But she showed up in a U-Haul with her dog, all her shit in the back. [[01:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=4334.32s)]
*  Oh, and then the other one that I've only have one U-Haul worth of shit [[01:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=4338.6s)]
*  to be a adult female, I feel like that's not that much. [[01:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=4342.96s)]
*  Probably could stay for like a month, right? [[01:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=4347.64s)]
*  So this is the other one. [[01:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=4351.16s)]
*  I want to get out there in a public way. [[01:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=4352.12s)]
*  And I've been trying to figure out a film, a video, put it out there. [[01:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=4353.88s)]
*  But I'm like, there's no win. You just look like a cocksucker. [[01:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=4355.88s)]
*  Yeah, I just look like a dick. [[01:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=4358.4s)]
*  But I want to put it out there and see if I can do it in a more elegant way. [[01:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=4359.68s)]
*  OK, on holidays, birthdays. [[01:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=4364.16s)]
*  Fourth of July, whatever it is, like if it means [[01:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=4368.96s)]
*  if you're if you're in my Rolodex and it means that much to you. [[01:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=4371.5599999999995s)]
*  Please send a card. Right. [[01:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=4375.8s)]
*  Stop texting. Happy birthday. [[01:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=4377.68s)]
*  Merry Christmas. Happy. [[01:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=4380.08s)]
*  It's like I think most of us and I know I'm in a different, very blessed. [[01:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=4381.36s)]
*  Happy BLM. I get that every year. [[01:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=4385.2s)]
*  No, but I mean, it's like, yeah, on Christmas, [[01:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=4390.12s)]
*  I want to spend that with my grandkids. [[01:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=4392.4s)]
*  Let's send the other and like, say my brother in law is bringing over [[01:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=4394.04s)]
*  the turkey that day and he has a question to ask about it. [[01:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=4397.48s)]
*  Like, say I don't even want to answer him. [[01:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=4400.639999999999s)]
*  I have to dig for that text through 7580, 100, like Merry Christmas. [[01:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=4402.04s)]
*  And I appreciate it very much. [[01:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=4407.839999999999s)]
*  I'm very blessed to have a lot of friends. [[01:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=4409.04s)]
*  But like if it means that much, like, please send a card. [[01:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=4410.36s)]
*  I'm not going to be upset if you don't text me on my birthday [[01:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=4413.04s)]
*  or save me at Christmas. [[01:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=4415.44s)]
*  Like those are special times. [[01:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=4416.719999999999s)]
*  Like, you know, you want to spend it with family [[01:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=4418.759999999999s)]
*  and we need to get the fuck off our phones. [[01:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=4420.4s)]
*  And computers on those days and get back to spending that time [[01:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=4422.28s)]
*  with the ones we love. Yeah. [[01:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=4424.88s)]
*  So that's my spiel. [[01:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=4426.48s)]
*  No, I think it's true, man. [[01:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=4427.759999999999s)]
*  I get I mean, I just had a birthday and it was like, oh, man, [[01:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=4429.08s)]
*  you spent half the birthday and then you feel bad that you didn't get back to people. [[01:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=4431.96s)]
*  That kind of stuff's a nightmare. [[01:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=4435.8s)]
*  Dude, you didn't text me back. [[01:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=4438.04s)]
*  Oh, man. Yeah. [[01:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=4439.679999999999s)]
*  Yeah. When somebody's like that about things, too, it's like. [[01:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=4442.599999999999s)]
*  Unless it's something that's super crucial or important, like, [[01:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=4446.44s)]
*  you know, starting to do that is like people. [[01:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=4449.8s)]
*  In your spot, maybe like people at Fox News and different places like [[01:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=4451.96s)]
*  I have a lot of friends there, you know, made friends with pretty much [[01:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=4456.04s)]
*  all the personalities at Fox one way or the other through the years [[01:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=4458.76s)]
*  and several other channels and this, that and the other. [[01:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=4461.4s)]
*  And so I'll go, you know, try to promote something to somebody show. [[01:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=4464.4800000000005s)]
*  And the other one started me like, I can't believe you're doing so and so show. [[01:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=4468.04s)]
*  I'm like. [[01:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=4471.32s)]
*  Are you shitting me like just like I got to go on everybody's show [[01:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=4473.12s)]
*  or you're going to, you know, and it's not like they're mad, [[01:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=4476.6s)]
*  but they just give me a little bit of shit. [[01:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=4479.08s)]
*  And I'm like, I don't need to get shit from you people. [[01:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=4480.84s)]
*  Like, I'm just trying to do what's best for my career. [[01:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=4483.400000000001s)]
*  I love you. [[01:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=4485.32s)]
*  I'm definitely going to try to do something with all my friends [[01:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=4486.24s)]
*  in the space at some point and help them out, you know, to have a great show. [[01:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=4488.52s)]
*  I want to see everybody win. [[01:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=4491.360000000001s)]
*  I'm a good friend. I'm a team player, but it's kind of frustrating. [[01:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=4492.8s)]
*  Yeah, that happens a lot, too. [[01:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=4497.4400000000005s)]
*  I think with podcasting, it's like, oh, you went on that show. [[01:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=4498.8s)]
*  What about my and it's like, you're just trying to survive. [[01:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=4501.56s)]
*  You're trying to get through your year. [[01:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=4503.92s)]
*  And especially when you podcast, you have to do your own. [[01:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=4505.64s)]
*  So it's hard to like I'll try and do like three or four a year of my friends, [[01:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=4508.12s)]
*  you know, because they've done mine and I want to, you know, do that. [[01:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=4512.0s)]
*  And I could do a podcast every single week. [[01:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=4515.96s)]
*  The people that reach out for me that are all friends. Yeah. [[01:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=4518.2s)]
*  And what's I don't care if it's politics, entertainment, actors, whatever. [[01:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=4520.92s)]
*  Like I could do it every single week. Yeah. [[01:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=4523.8s)]
*  That's it's it's insane. It's interesting. [[01:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=4527.32s)]
*  Oh, yeah. Let me read that last part of that. [[01:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=4530.32s)]
*  I so I can finish that up. [[01:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=4531.84s)]
*  Yeah, I just want to read that. [[01:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=4534.2s)]
*  The volunteer, the move makes Tennessee long known as the birthplace of music [[01:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=4536.08s)]
*  and the launchpad for musical legends, the first state in the US to enact such measures. [[01:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=4540.28s)]
*  What does that do, though? [[01:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=4545.2s)]
*  What is the actual bill? What does it say? [[01:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=4546.36s)]
*  Basically, you own the rights to your voice and your image and likeness, [[01:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=4549.04s)]
*  which is has been that way for for all time. [[01:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=4553.44s)]
*  But people also couldn't create like a song that sounds exactly like whoever. [[01:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=4556.8s)]
*  You know, this technology is this is just the tip of the iceberg. [[01:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=4560.92s)]
*  This technology. [[01:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=4563.84s)]
*  I wonder. Go back one more time. [[01:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=4564.68s)]
*  It says the volunteer state is just one of three states where name, [[01:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=4566.68s)]
*  photographs and likeness are considered a property right rather than a right of publicity. [[01:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=4569.92s)]
*  Exactly. Oh, I love that. [[01:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=4574.4800000000005s)]
*  That's why I probably go back. [[01:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=4575.92s)]
*  Tennessee should be leading that fight, you know, with people like Marsha [[01:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=4577.32s)]
*  Blackburn and my friend Senator Bill Haggerty and Governor Bill Lee. [[01:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=4580.52s)]
*  You know, this they should be leading this charge. [[01:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=4583.84s)]
*  I've actually talked to several about really taking a hard look at Ticketmaster. [[01:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=4586.4800000000005s)]
*  Like they have a monopoly. It's. [[01:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=4589.92s)]
*  And even though I make a lot of money for them and I love the people at Live Nation, [[01:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=4591.84s)]
*  we've done great business together. [[01:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=4595.360000000001s)]
*  I'm like, this is fucked up. [[01:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=4596.68s)]
*  Like I'll be the first one to admit like I'm overpaid. [[01:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=4598.0s)]
*  There's no reason to make this much money, but I can't control it [[01:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=4601.52s)]
*  because the market dictated in Ticketmaster, they made over a billion dollars [[01:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=4604.92s)]
*  in the secondary market last year. [[01:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=4608.4400000000005s)]
*  That means if you buy a ticket and go to a concert, you're their worst customer. [[01:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=4610.04s)]
*  They want that ticket to resell, resell and keep getting keep getting that money on it. [[01:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=4615.2s)]
*  And they could cut it out, but the government will not hold them [[01:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=4619.679999999999s)]
*  responsible to stop the bots. [[01:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=4622.599999999999s)]
*  The government says we're going to do it. [[01:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=4625.04s)]
*  They're not doing shit. [[01:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=4626.08s)]
*  And these bots are out of hand. [[01:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=4627.599999999999s)]
*  We have to like I could charge so much less if I could get those tickets [[01:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=4629.4s)]
*  to people that want to come see me fans. [[01:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=4633.24s)]
*  But like when we've done it in the past, $20 tickets, it's like [[01:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=4634.639999999999s)]
*  we have to scalp our own tickets just to combat the real scalpers. [[01:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=4637.96s)]
*  And I know people that do this that used to work at big banks like Goldman Sachs. [[01:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=4641.5599999999995s)]
*  They do this full time and it's nothing illegal. [[01:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=4646.36s)]
*  They go on, you know, whatever night of the week and they buy as many tickets [[01:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=4648.48s)]
*  as they can to like 10, 15 of the hottest shows in the world. [[01:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=4651.5599999999995s)]
*  And then they just resell them for markup. [[01:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=4654.4s)]
*  And they're making more money than they were being at a huge bank. [[01:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=4656.32s)]
*  Yeah. And the fees, you'll you'll sell two tickets for $120. [[01:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=4660.08s)]
*  And the fees are $120. [[01:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=4664.639999999999s)]
*  No, they're $120. [[01:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=4666.24s)]
*  They're almost damn it's insanity. [[01:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=4668.839999999999s)]
*  It's and you're telling me we can't get this under control. [[01:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=4671.4s)]
*  And I've told our senators here in Tennessee, the problem is Republicans, too. [[01:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=4673.799999999999s)]
*  This is one thing where I'm more, you know, leaning left on this [[01:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=4678.639999999999s)]
*  because I'm a capitalist and a lot of conservatives, we free market capitalism. [[01:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=4681.28s)]
*  I'm like, right. This is out of hand. [[01:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=4685.48s)]
*  This is a place where regulation makes sense. [[01:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=4687.44s)]
*  You know, I'm for deregulation on most things, but I'm like, [[01:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=4690.16s)]
*  this is somewhere where it makes sense. [[01:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=4692.839999999999s)]
*  And this is something maybe I can actually try and do [[01:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=4694.32s)]
*  because it's something I know something about and have done the homework on it. [[01:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=4696.839999999999s)]
*  Right. So we'll see. [[01:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=4700.04s)]
*  What does something like that include, though? [[01:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=4701.599999999999s)]
*  You think it's like starting a like because I'm sure people have tried [[01:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=4703.16s)]
*  to start different sites and different ways of doing it. [[01:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=4706.68s)]
*  I'm I wonder how you would take it. [[01:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=4710.76s)]
*  Master has a monopoly. Yeah. [[01:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=4713.0s)]
*  There's other places to do that. [[01:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=4715.4800000000005s)]
*  Well, monopoly is illegal. Yes. [[01:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=4716.4400000000005s)]
*  Yeah, you can't just control the whole market on anything. [[01:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=4719.400000000001s)]
*  You know, people have to be able to compete, you know, offer a service [[01:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=4722.6s)]
*  because that's what keeps prices in check. Right. [[01:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=4725.04s)]
*  And coming down, if you just if you're the only guy that sells camel pants [[01:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=4727.52s)]
*  in town, you charge whatever you want. [[01:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=4730.72s)]
*  Yeah, I know Zach Brian was trying to he tried to have a new method where [[01:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=4732.68s)]
*  they reached out direct. [[01:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=4736.68s)]
*  It was like a lottery system. It's a conundrum. [[01:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=4739.52s)]
*  Trust me, I just saw Eddie Vedder recently at an event and they're really [[01:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=4742.4800000000005s)]
*  Pearl Jam was really the first people that really went down this rabbit hole. [[01:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=4747.08s)]
*  Yeah, I remember that. Right. [[01:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=4750.0s)]
*  And I was just talked to briefly. [[01:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=4751.68s)]
*  I was like, hey, I'm kind of going down that rabbit hole again. [[01:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=4753.8s)]
*  If you want to get on board, like because this needs to be like, you know, [[01:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=4756.200000000001s)]
*  he's obviously liberal and, you know, you know where my politics stand. [[01:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=4758.8s)]
*  But I go, this is something where I think we could get together on [[01:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=4762.04s)]
*  and because we're doing this for people, for fans to try to make things better. [[01:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=4765.28s)]
*  You know, it's so sick. [[01:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=4768.599999999999s)]
*  So we'll see. But all of us were younger, just like Zach Brian's doing. [[01:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=4770.32s)]
*  It's like we all want to try and change it. [[01:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=4773.5199999999995s)]
*  And then you get down this deep dark hole and you're like, fuck, I can't do it. [[01:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=4775.639999999999s)]
*  You know, we need these politicians to change it or they need to straighten up. [[01:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=4780.12s)]
*  You know, take a match needs to do the right thing because they're claiming [[01:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=4784.679999999999s)]
*  it's the right thing. This verified fan and all this shit. [[01:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=4787.44s)]
*  Well, guess what? The artists don't get any of that. [[01:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=4789.639999999999s)]
*  Yeah. It's fucking highway robbery. [[01:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=4791.32s)]
*  Well, to the fact that you would pay the same amount to for ticketing fees, [[01:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=4794.28s)]
*  which is online, that you would to the to an artist for that. [[01:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=4797.96s)]
*  It's like and Joe Biden's out there talking about like, oh, we got it under control. [[01:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=4802.4400000000005s)]
*  All he did was make them print what the fee is. [[01:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=4805.68s)]
*  Not like change it. [[01:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=4808.88s)]
*  No, you just have to tell people where you're fucking them. [[01:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=4810.0s)]
*  You got to just put that on there. It's bananas. [[01:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=4812.72s)]
*  Yeah, it makes me sad. And you know what it makes me say? [[01:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=4815.56s)]
*  Sometimes it makes me sad even put tickets on sale because I know that part of it [[01:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=4817.68s)]
*  is going to be that people are going to have to pay those fees, you know? [[01:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=4821.2s)]
*  It's crazy. [[01:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=4824.32s)]
*  I did want to get this part scroll up a little bit so I can read this part, please. [[01:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=4825.16s)]
*  The volunteer state is just one of three states where name, photographs [[01:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=4828.76s)]
*  and likeness are considered a property rather than a right of publicity. [[01:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=4831.68s)]
*  So that's interesting. [[01:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=4835.12s)]
*  I think that's why they can't do like TMZ here and stuff like that. [[01:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=4835.92s)]
*  Well, they tried. They did. [[01:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=4838.88s)]
*  We ran them fuckers out of town. [[01:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=4840.72s)]
*  What about here? [[01:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=4842.68s)]
*  You do that shit bullshit in L.A. [[01:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=4844.72s)]
*  and New York where people call you and they want that fucking lifestyle. [[01:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=4846.2s)]
*  It's like and I'm sure there's a couple of idiots here that want it. [[01:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=4849.0s)]
*  It's like majority of us don't. [[01:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=4851.36s)]
*  And you're not going to be treated very nicely around here. [[01:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=4852.92s)]
*  Yeah. Don't bring that bullshit to Tennessee. [[01:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=4855.04s)]
*  I tell you, did you get one of my bumper stickers? [[01:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=4858.44s)]
*  Mm hmm. That sticker is amazing. [[01:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=4860.16s)]
*  Don't turn Nashville into the piece of shit city you moved here from. [[01:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=4862.08s)]
*  I wonder if it's happening more. [[01:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=4867.88s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=4870.04s)]
*  I wonder if it's going to be harder for people to. [[01:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=4871.32s)]
*  I was actually talking with Nick Cannon about this the other day. [[01:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=4876.04s)]
*  He was saying that in the future, you would be able to be in a movie [[01:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=4878.52s)]
*  just by licensing yourself to that movie and never have to go to a set [[01:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=4882.84s)]
*  or never have to. [[01:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=4887.320000000001s)]
*  So work less, make the same amount. I'm in. Yeah. [[01:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=4889.4400000000005s)]
*  That took me about what? [[01:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=4893.120000000001s)]
*  Half a second to do that math. But. [[01:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=4894.64s)]

*  It feels like that's really. [[01:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=4933.56s)]
*  It's always behind. [[01:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=4934.360000000001s)]
*  If you're looking for the government to be ahead of things. [[01:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=4935.400000000001s)]
*  You know, the famous Ronald Reagan, you know, line was, [[01:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=4937.719999999999s)]

*  And that's because our forefathers put in a lot of checks and balances, [[01:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=4955.4s)]
*  which makes sense in a lot of ways. [[01:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=4958.4s)]

*  to get ahead of A&I because, you know, it sounds like there's some scary shit [[01:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=4966.36s)]

*  Never have. Yeah, it's unfortunate, but it feels like the responsibility [[01:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=4979.32s)]
*  is more and more on the person, maybe more than ever to take care of yourself, [[01:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nReTPXtTDDc&t=4983.16s)]
