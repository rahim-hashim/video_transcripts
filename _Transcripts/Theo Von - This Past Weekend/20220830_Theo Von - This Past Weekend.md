*  species. I think at that point. Yeah. I think I started to get feathers on my jannies. Fucking [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=214.72s)]

*  I heard a million dollars. I don't think it was a million, but it was, it was a lot of money. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=248.0s)]
*  If you tipped it, did you tip? I always tip. I'm really good at tipping. I think it's important. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=251.52s)]
*  What do you think it was when you say a lot of money? How much was it? I mean, it was definitely [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=256.24s)]

*  I didn't see any bartender. I do remember a hand would come up every now and then. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=297.6s)]
*  It would just conjure up a beverage. Oh my God. So which magic? Yeah. You're like the hand, [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=302.72s)]
*  like from Adam's family would just come in and fucking dude, I heard that hand molested like a [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=308.72s)]
*  bunch of kids. Dude, stay away from hands. If it's just a hand, it's up to no good. Um, [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=314.24s)]
*  but yeah, I remember going to meet you at a, you're like, yeah, come over. We're partying [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=321.2s)]

*  season and it didn't even have any TVs in it. And I was like, this is what really that's weird. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=329.36s)]
*  That was because I remember being like, Oh, that's cause I know you're a Vikings fan. I was like, [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=335.44s)]
*  that's weird. But then there were like cavernous things lit. There was like light, like torches. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=339.04s)]

*  What is wrong with me? I felt like, is this probably like a geologist thing? It had a very [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=350.0s)]
*  Indiana Jones meets like, um, I mean, I do sober living, right? Okay. That's interesting. I do [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=354.32s)]
*  hunt for treasure when I'm on tour, I do try to find treasures. So I do end up with some sketchy [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=361.04s)]
*  snake spider bars. Did you, uh, so you quit, you had to quit drinking. I had to take a time out. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=365.76s)]
*  Yeah. But, um, yeah, I like picking shoes. Like I've gotten to the point where like labor day [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=372.48s)]
*  weekend, like holiday weekend, I'm going to drink. Okay. You know what I mean? But then I, I won't [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=376.8s)]
*  go like bonkers because I'm going on tour this fall, starting after labor day. And I remember, [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=381.44s)]
*  I'm going to not drink as much as I used to because it got so, I would just get caught up with fans [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=386.32s)]
*  and going out. And then there was one time, couple of times, there's one time I sincerely did this. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=391.44s)]
*  I walked out on stage in Louisville, Kentucky, and this is genuine. I walk out and I go, dude, [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=396.08s)]
*  not only is this my first time in Louisville, this is my first time ever performing in Louisville. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=402.88s)]
*  And this guy goes, not, you were here last tour. And I'm like, yeah, I know, but not this theater. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=408.8s)]

*  Good to see everybody again. But it's because the time before that I don't drink bourbon. And I [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=422.48s)]
*  went out and people took me into just ripping bourbon. And that was just one of those alcohols [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=428.24s)]
*  where it's just the switch is just by, Oh yeah. Next thing you know, you're trying to just suck [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=432.64s)]
*  off your knees. Yeah, man. You're trying to fucking blow your knees and a possum that starts [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=437.6s)]

*  and I peed and then I ordered a shitload of food, like way too much on this tray. And then I turned [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=472.64s)]
*  around and slipped in my own pee and then threw all the food all over the place. I wiped out, [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=476.4s)]
*  panicked and ran out and then had to find my hotel. I had just gotten in. I had no idea what was [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=481.12s)]

*  I for me, they seem to roll it out well. [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=2258.3s)]
*  But I remember that [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=2261.18s)]

*  I felt like it was like they were it was like a little Bermuda Triangle [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=2279.6200000000003s)]

*  Right. If you're throwing a frisbee in a hot tub. [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=2295.82s)]

*  and then playing horseshoes with their boners. [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=2324.06s)]
*  We throw it like ring toss and you got to fucking land it. [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=2325.94s)]
*  So that would be gayer than that. [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=2329.34s)]
*  That's true. For the thing. [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=2332.58s)]

*  You tell me that student loans pretty much. [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=2345.54s)]
*  Yes. Like, yeah. [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=2347.62s)]
*  You get student loans when you're growing up. [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=2348.7799999999997s)]
*  No, I went to barely graduate high school. Really? Yeah. [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=2350.8199999999997s)]
*  I mean, I should have gotten a loan. [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=2354.5s)]
*  I think the college. But I mean, I just know of it. [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=2356.7799999999997s)]
*  My brother went to college and he was fucked by student loans like forever. [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=2358.9s)]
*  Yeah. I guess everybody has. I don't really know. [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=2363.38s)]
*  They got this bail. [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=2365.2599999999998s)]
*  They have so they have a bailout program. Go up on it. [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=2366.1s)]
*  And it wasn't Christian. What's going on? [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=2368.06s)]
*  Well, it's basically just like the the aftermath now. [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=2369.54s)]
*  Biden saying that he's forgiving, you know, the student loans, 10 grand for everyone. [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=2371.86s)]
*  It's like now basically the question is becoming, is it legal? [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=2375.42s)]
*  And people are going to challenge it in court because they're saying, you know, [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=2378.9s)]
*  hey, if I paid off all my loans, what like what about me? Right. [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=2381.58s)]
*  Any relief for me? Right. [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=2385.42s)]
*  So, yeah, do you think because that's where people are upset. [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=2387.46s)]
*  It's like some people are like, well, I sent my kid to college. [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=2389.94s)]
*  I saved money to send him to college or her to college. [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=2393.38s)]
*  And now I'm I've paid that money off. Right. [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=2397.5s)]
*  And so if someone didn't do that and they have debt [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=2401.66s)]
*  and you're just that's where it's becoming an issue. [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=2405.34s)]
*  Right. I mean, I can see that, but it's also those are different situations. [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=2409.1800000000003s)]
*  So, I mean, some people might be really there's got to be extenuating [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=2413.78s)]
*  circumstances and factors of why they can pay it off. [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=2417.38s)]
*  Oh, yeah, I think so. [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=2421.7400000000002s)]
*  But some people are just saying, like, well, do I get do I get compensated [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=2422.86s)]
*  for the money that I should? [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=2427.1400000000003s)]
*  Should there be like a legitimate claim? [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=2428.54s)]
*  Yeah, that's what it seemed like would be the solution to me is you also offer. [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=2430.7000000000003s)]
*  But then how far back does that go? [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=2434.14s)]
*  You know, that's the thing is that brings up a bigger picture. [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=2436.1s)]
*  You know, everybody can be upset about stuff like that. [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=2438.38s)]
*  I mean, some guys, 100 and like I was the first guy at Yale. [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=2441.54s)]
*  Yeah. And I paid off my ten dollar fee. [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=2446.7400000000002s)]
*  I want ten grand. [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=2451.82s)]
*  And some guys like, I was a slave and they're like, you're white, buddy, is like, oh, [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=2454.7400000000002s)]
*  fuck my bad. [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=2460.7000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I don't know. [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=2464.2200000000003s)]
*  I don't know how to solve that. [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=2466.18s)]
*  I think just don't go to college. [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=2467.3s)]
*  I don't know. Start a YouTube channel. [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=2472.06s)]
*  I don't know. Whatever. [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=2474.3s)]
*  It's a new world now. [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=2475.98s)]
*  But I mean, yeah, I mean, I can see that because student loans. [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=2477.54s)]
*  I don't even know. I don't even know if my brother's paid it off. [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=2480.66s)]
*  He's a fucking idiot. [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=2483.06s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, it took me probably. [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=2484.5s)]
*  I mean, I just paid man off, I think, about two years ago. [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=2486.02s)]
*  But it's a long deal for people. [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=2489.1s)]
*  So I can understand people wanting to. [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=2490.58s)]
*  But then at a certain point, you're like, where does it end? [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=2492.3s)]
*  It's tough. It's like, like, I think of it like someday there's going to be a thing [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=2494.1800000000003s)]
*  where it's like there's going to be a pill where it's like you can live forever. [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=2498.42s)]
*  Right. But they're right. [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=2501.1800000000003s)]
*  OK, say there's a pill one day you can live forever. [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=2504.1s)]
*  OK, but they're going to say they're going to say, hey, [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=2506.7400000000002s)]
*  it's for only 40 and under because they're whoever's the ruler at that point. [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=2511.2200000000003s)]
*  They're like, we don't really need these old heads, you know? [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=2515.46s)]
*  Like you stop at a certain age. [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=2518.22s)]
*  You can't buy it after 60. Right. [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=2519.58s)]
*  And it's just going to be that cut off where it's like, oh, fuck, you know, [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=2522.2999999999997s)]
*  like sometimes you just have to there just has to be the thing where it's like, [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=2525.54s)]
*  oh, they get this break and I, you know. [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=2529.54s)]
*  But we don't think about it like that. [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=2532.18s)]
*  Nobody wants to think like, oh, I'm happy that these people get their debt reduced. [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=2533.4199999999996s)]
*  I paid mine. [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=2538.62s)]
*  You know, nobody thinks like people are usually think, oh, well, they got they get this. [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=2539.54s)]
*  I should also get this. Right. [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=2543.62s)]
*  Which makes sense. [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=2545.22s)]
*  It's just we don't really think the other way very often. [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=2547.46s)]
*  Well, no, and nobody really wants to be happy for anybody else. Yeah. [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=2550.02s)]
*  But it's I'm like that. [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=2553.78s)]
*  But if I'm at the bar, I'm like, why do I have to pay my bar tab? Right. [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=2554.7400000000002s)]
*  Why can't they pay for it? [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=2558.1800000000003s)]
*  Because I've spent a lot of money here and maybe I should get compensated. [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=2559.78s)]
*  Yeah, that's what I think. [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=2564.9s)]
*  Do you know about all the money I spent drinking, deciding not to go to college? [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=2567.38s)]
*  Yeah. All the money I could have saved and did say. [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=2570.5800000000004s)]

*  I would have gone to carpentry college. [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=2584.62s)]
*  I would have gone to Harvard and majored in carpentry with a minor [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=2586.4199999999996s)]

*  Why don't we stay at the travel lodge? [[01:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=3820.54s)]

*  So they're like, yeah. [[01:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=3826.54s)]
*  So we drive to Vegas, get in the room, check in. [[01:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=3828.62s)]
*  Where is how far from the strip is it? [[01:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=3831.7s)]
*  It's not far. Ten minutes, maybe. [[01:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=3833.9s)]
*  What's so far? And so if that maybe five. [[01:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=3835.34s)]

*  And I put some my shit down and he goes, let's get the fuck out of here, man. [[01:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=3843.46s)]

*  You know, and then she started screaming. [[01:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=4168.34s)]

*  I'll probably cave a couple of certain cities that are, you know, [[01:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=4436.38s)]
*  when you look at a tour and you're like, oh, this town is going to be tricky [[01:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=4439.74s)]
*  to like if I mean to not drink in Chicago is hard, but I'm only there for one day. [[01:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=4445.54s)]
*  So that helps. But to not drink in like Nashville, [[01:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=4450.18s)]
*  that's going to be tricky. [[01:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=4454.06s)]
*  There's there's certain cities where San Diego. [[01:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=4455.74s)]
*  Tricky Vegas, obviously. [[01:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=4459.38s)]
*  But that's a lot. And how many cities are you going to? [[01:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=4461.86s)]
*  I'm doing like 30 right now. [[01:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=4464.26s)]
*  OK. Nick Swartz and dot net for tickets. [[01:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=4465.9s)]
*  Are you touring this year anymore or no? [[01:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=4467.86s)]
*  Yeah. Got some shows coming up. [[01:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=4469.66s)]
*  Where are you going? San Diego, Denver, somewhere else. [[01:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=4472.259999999999s)]
*  Denver's great. The altitude, though. [[01:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=4477.66s)]
*  God damn, dude, I get fucked on the altitude every time. [[01:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=4479.259999999999s)]
*  If you're going to a place with altitude, drink water. [[01:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=4482.259999999999s)]
*  Like I know it sounds like stupid or whatever. [[01:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=4485.58s)]
*  Drink a lot of water before you go and when you're there. [[01:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=4488.58s)]
*  Yeah, because it's I got I just did six shows in Denver. [[01:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=4491.219999999999s)]
*  They're amazing. I love Denver. [[01:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=4494.74s)]
*  But dude, I got sick as shit. [[01:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=4497.1s)]
*  I was throwing up in the green room every day before the show. [[01:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=4499.18s)]
*  Add green to it. Yeah. [[01:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=4502.42s)]
*  Um, yeah, the only reason I asked about the drinking stuff is just because [[01:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=4504.18s)]
*  I'm always curious about that kind of stuff. [[01:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=4508.02s)]
*  I'm curious about, like, you know, the effect it has on people. [[01:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=4509.5s)]
*  How do people manage it? [[01:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=4511.86s)]
*  Because our lifestyles are also different lifestyles, you know, way different. [[01:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=4513.1s)]
*  It's different than a normal lifestyle. [[01:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=4517.18s)]
*  You know, like we usually get into this business because like, you know, [[01:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=4519.14s)]
*  we have different ways that we feel OK in the world. [[01:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=4522.98s)]
*  And, you know, there's a lot of people in our industry that like, [[01:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=4528.0599999999995s)]
*  you know, battle with substance and stuff is very normal. [[01:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=4530.66s)]
*  Yeah, totally. It's very normal. [[01:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=4533.7s)]
*  I just want you to know why I ask about that kind of stuff. [[01:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=4536.179999999999s)]
*  Yeah, of course. No, it's a valid question. [[01:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=4537.98s)]
*  And I've dealt with so much shit in the past. [[01:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=4539.94s)]
*  Like I said, you know, I almost died. Yeah. [[01:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=4542.179999999999s)]
*  And I didn't know this for people that don't know. I almost died. [[01:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=4544.259999999999s)]
*  I was in the hospital in Denver and I was there for three and a half weeks. [[01:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=4546.86s)]
*  And there's people that have quadruple bypass surgeries [[01:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=4551.379999999999s)]
*  that are in and out in four days. [[01:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=4554.94s)]
*  I was over three and a half weeks. [[01:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=4557.419999999999s)]
*  And the doctor told me I had a 10 percent chance of living. [[01:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=4558.58s)]
*  And then when I got out and I got better, they had lied to me. [[01:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=4561.62s)]
*  I was supposed to be dead. [[01:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=4565.339999999999s)]
*  So my family flew in to say goodbye to me. No. [[01:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=4567.0199999999995s)]
*  And they told me that you have a 10 percent chance. [[01:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=4570.139999999999s)]
*  And then my sister was like, yeah, they lied that you were going to. [[01:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=4572.299999999999s)]
*  You were supposed to die. [[01:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=4574.46s)]
*  So that's a trip, dude, when you experience something like that [[01:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=4576.219999999999s)]
*  and then you come back to life, essentially, [[01:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=4579.82s)]
*  it just changes your whole fucking Steve mindset. [[01:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=4582.58s)]
*  Because you're just like, oh, I'm like now living on borrowed time. [[01:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=4587.1s)]
*  That's how I see it. [[01:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=4590.14s)]
*  So how long once that happens, what you got taken, [[01:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=4591.1s)]
*  were you at a place and collapsed at something like what was what happened? [[01:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=4593.74s)]
*  I flew into Denver. [[01:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=4596.98s)]
*  I got sick at my hotel in Minneapolis. [[01:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=4599.1s)]
*  And then I was like, whatever, I'm used to that. [[01:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=4601.58s)]
*  I was throwing up like bile. [[01:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=4603.22s)]
*  Then I got on the plane, drank on the plane, threw up into my carry on. [[01:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=4604.82s)]
*  So then I got off the plane. I'm like, shit. [[01:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=4609.66s)]
*  So then I hadn't eaten or anything. [[01:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=4612.5s)]
*  So I ate like even were you drinking? [[01:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=4613.78s)]
*  I just kept drinking, but I kept vomiting. [[01:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=4616.0199999999995s)]
*  And it was more and more painful than I had to pay my stump. [[01:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=4618.18s)]
*  But I had a pain that was different. [[01:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=4621.78s)]
*  It was like pain, like fire pain. [[01:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=4624.18s)]
*  Yeah. And I kept trying to drink through it. [[01:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=4627.1s)]
*  And then I'm like, oh, this know something's horribly wrong. [[01:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=4630.1s)]
*  And I went to the medic at the airport and they're like, oh, you need an ambulance. [[01:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=4633.58s)]
*  Well, yeah, they have like somebody, you know what I mean? [[01:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=4638.7s)]
*  I'm like, hey, something's wrong. [[01:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=4640.7s)]
*  Wait, was it that express spa or whatever that? [[01:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=4642.0199999999995s)]
*  No, it wasn't like a massage chair. [[01:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=4645.0599999999995s)]
*  I didn't sit there and like, no, I grabbed a human. [[01:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=4646.54s)]
*  OK, at a ticket counter. [[01:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=4650.82s)]
*  I'm like, hey, something's wrong. [[01:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=4652.0599999999995s)]
*  And the guy looked at me and he goes, oh, you need an ambulance. [[01:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=4654.259999999999s)]
*  They call me an ambulance. [[01:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=4657.139999999999s)]
*  And I went to the second. [[01:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=4657.94s)]
*  You got ambulance out of the airport. [[01:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=4658.94s)]
*  Yeah. Where does it pick up at departures or arrivals? [[01:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=4661.179999999999s)]
*  I don't remember, but I think I think it was departures [[01:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=4664.0199999999995s)]
*  because they thought I was going to have it. [[01:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=4667.1s)]
*  Yeah. Jesus was my pilot. [[01:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=4670.46s)]
*  He was like, and did you have a beer at the airport? [[01:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=4672.58s)]

*  And I'm like, OK, this is I can't get through this. [[01:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=4678.46s)]
*  I drank a Gatorade, threw it up. [[01:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=4681.42s)]
*  I had like a banana, some kind of food. [[01:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=4682.820000000001s)]

*  And the altitude was a big factor in that. [[01:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=4728.62s)]
*  What? Fuck. No, I wasn't. [[01:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=4730.22s)]

*  That happening. So do you think you could? [[01:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=4755.099999999999s)]
*  Because you could if you because you I mean, at that point, [[01:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=4757.0599999999995s)]

*  I mean, I'm fine now. [[01:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=4764.74s)]
*  I mean, obviously, like, did they say you can drink again or you can't drink again? [[01:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=4766.099999999999s)]
*  Well, it was the doctor goes, if you have another drink, you're going to die. [[01:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=4770.54s)]
*  So I was like, well, that doesn't make sense. [[01:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=4773.42s)]
*  But I'm like, OK, so then I rehabbed and then got, you know, better [[01:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=4775.9s)]
*  and get really healthy. [[01:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=4780.98s)]
*  And then I went and got a checkup three months after. [[01:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=4782.82s)]
*  And the doctor was like, oh, yeah, a different doctor back in L.A. [[01:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=4785.54s)]
*  And he's like, yeah, you're fine. Everything's fine. [[01:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=4788.78s)]
*  And I'm like, what? And he goes, yeah, it's all. [[01:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=4790.7s)]
*  Yeah, everything's back. Your liver's back. [[01:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=4792.98s)]
*  I mean, I was like, really, your liver detoxed hard. [[01:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=4794.46s)]
*  Well, you do your liver can rebound. Yeah. [[01:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=4797.7s)]
*  I mean, you can get to a point where it can't, [[01:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=4800.82s)]
*  where I've had a handful of friends where that's happened to. [[01:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=4803.46s)]
*  But I mean, you can push it and then you've got to really dry out. [[01:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=4806.34s)]
*  So I did. And it was vitamins and fucking milk, this everything just built back up. [[01:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=4809.9s)]
*  And then I still wait another six months. [[01:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=4815.179999999999s)]
*  And then Covid hit and quarantine. I went to Key West. [[01:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=4817.139999999999s)]
*  And I'm like, you know what? I'm just going to. [[01:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=4820.299999999999s)]
*  It doesn't make sense. So I had a cocktail and I was I was fine. [[01:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=4821.7s)]
*  And then I drank again. [[01:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=4824.66s)]
*  Yeah, I just want you to be OK. [[01:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=4826.62s)]
*  Which sounds dumb. [[01:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=4827.5s)]
*  I'm sure people like you're a fucking idiot. [[01:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=4828.339999999999s)]
*  But I didn't drink like I was drinking very rogue. [[01:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=4829.82s)]
*  I mean, I was just boom shots and just completely stupid. Wow. [[01:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=4833.82s)]
*  But now I like, you know, I can have a cocktail. [[01:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=4838.219999999999s)]

*  But you do have to be really careful. [[01:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=4841.419999999999s)]
*  Do you think you can have a cocktail? Yeah, I did. [[01:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=4844.0199999999995s)]

*  you know, what people can do, because some people can't. [[01:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=4860.139999999999s)]

*  and then people like, no, I still have blood in my. [[01:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=4906.34s)]

*  Boot Barn. I don't know. [[01:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=4913.34s)]
*  I mean, at some places, I don't want to say, because I don't want to get. [[01:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=4916.34s)]
*  They're good. I don't see a partnership, but. [[01:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=4920.34s)]
*  I'd love to see LDS first, LJS, bro. [[01:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=4922.34s)]
*  Long John Silver's versus long Latter Day Saints. [[01:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=4927.34s)]
*  Oh, the Church of Latter Day Saints. [[01:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=4930.34s)]

*  They had what was the thing with the the drivers there or the. [[01:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=4940.34s)]
*  Oh, yeah, the key of boys. This is crazy. [[01:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=4947.34s)]
*  This is crazy. What is that? [[01:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=4950.34s)]
*  OK, so thefts of Kia's in Hyundai's are soaring like 800 percent [[01:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=4952.34s)]
*  because there's a tick tock trend and there are no videos of it, obviously. [[01:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=4957.34s)]
*  But there is a tick tock trend where you can basically hotwire Kia [[01:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=4961.34s)]
*  with just like touching the USB port or touching it with like an aux cable [[01:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=4965.34s)]
*  for your car, you know, and then kids are sharing how to do it with the hashtag Kia boys. [[01:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=4969.34s)]
*  So it's just like, I mean, everyone with Kia or Hyundai, you got to lock yourself up right now. [[01:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=4974.34s)]
*  It's happening. God. Yeah, my friend got a Kia stolen. [[01:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=4979.34s)]
*  That's funny. Not funny, but like, oh, you can jump start with an earring, dude. [[01:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=4983.34s)]
*  Well, yeah, it's like a huge design flaw. [[01:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=4987.34s)]
*  You just make contact with something in there here. [[01:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=4989.34s)]
*  I'll show their screen grab. Oh, that's a nightmare. [[01:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=4991.34s)]
*  There's screen grabs of it here because they delayed disabled the videos. [[01:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=4994.34s)]
*  But you just touch something in there and then it goes and they haven't fixed it yet. [[01:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=4997.34s)]
*  It's unbelievable. Oh, that's brutal. [[01:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=5002.34s)]
*  And if you're out there, don't fucking do that. [[01:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=5004.34s)]
*  Good God. Why like, you know, why make people's lives worse? [[01:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=5007.34s)]
*  Stealing somebody's fucking car. They probably have a family and if you know what I mean? [[01:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=5011.34s)]
*  Kia Sophia. Dude, Kia Sophia is also a black girl that I would kiss. [[01:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=5015.34s)]
*  If you have a hand was a black girl that I went to school with. Is that true? [[01:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=5019.34s)]
*  Yeah. So they should easily pay her for this, right? Yeah, they've got it. [[01:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=5022.34s)]
*  They owe her money now. Yeah, that's crazy. [[01:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=5026.34s)]
*  Also, I don't know. I never owned a Kia. [[01:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=5030.34s)]
*  You ever borrow your parents' car without them knowing? [[01:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=5033.34s)]
*  I've stolen my parents' car. Yeah, I crashed my dad's car. [[01:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=5035.34s)]
*  I've crashed both my parents' cars. Why? What happened? [[01:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=5039.34s)]
*  Um, I got drunk and went to buy drugs. [[01:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=5042.34s)]
*  I got drunk and went to buy drugs at night when I was in high school. [[01:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=5046.34s)]
*  Now, what kind of drug you talking about? Weed, weed. Yeah. [[01:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=5049.34s)]

*  He'd be like, want some, dude? [[01:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=5060.34s)]
*  And he would give me like 20 bucks worth. [[01:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=5063.34s)]
*  Do I remember I loved weed so much, I sold my dad's penny collection. [[01:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=5066.34s)]
*  I went and cashed in his pennies. No, those booklets? [[01:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=5071.34s)]
*  Yeah, those books and pennies. Oh, the Midwestern things that your parents have? [[01:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=5074.34s)]
*  Yeah, it's not even enough to buy weed. I think I bought like a half of a seed. [[01:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=5077.34s)]
*  Bring those up. Bring up the penny collector books. My grandmother had these. [[01:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=5083.34s)]

*  I was like, I think back on my god. This was worth 895 bucks right here, this one. [[01:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=5106.34s)]
*  We've all done this, Nick. [[01:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=5110.34s)]
*  And what'd you do? You borrowed the car and what? [[01:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=5113.34s)]
*  I would drive to go buy the weed. But my dad's, one of my moms, I got too high and then went off a ditch. [[01:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=5116.34s)]
*  And then my dad's, I turned into a telephone pole. [[01:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=5122.34s)]
*  Because, you know, in the Midwest, it's like there's ice when it snows, after it snows. [[01:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=5125.34s)]
*  And then I hit an ice patch and went, and then into a telephone pole. [[01:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=5130.34s)]
*  And these guys were chasing me. I think they were like kind of thug dudes. [[01:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=5134.34s)]
*  And I thought they were going to kill me. And then I crashed my car and then they pulled over and they're like, are you alright? [[01:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=5137.34s)]
*  And I'm like, no, it's my dad's car. I'm going to fucking die. [[01:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=5143.34s)]

*  It's crazy now how with that car theft, people can, when a burglar learns something, they can now put that out. [[01:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=5164.34s)]
*  It's like, here's a way where you can. It's like, why would you pay it forward? [[01:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=5171.34s)]
*  Right. But I understand you wouldn't. It's weird. It's dumb. [[01:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=5176.34s)]
*  It's not helpful to society. [[01:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=5180.34s)]
*  But this is the kind of thing that people are just thinking like this is how you can do it. [[01:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=5182.34s)]
*  You know, this is how you can steal a car. You know, yeah, it's crazy. [[01:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=5186.34s)]

*  There's like vigilante social media for like if you're doing something bad or something good, they had another story with bring up the story with the lady that followed. [[01:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=5204.34s)]
*  You know, I'm talking about that. Yeah. [[01:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=5216.34s)]
*  This was on Reddit. It's got a ton of views. [[01:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=5221.34s)]
*  But basically this business owner, she was robbed and found the person who did it and found him on the bus and followed them home. [[01:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=5224.34s)]
*  This video is one minute long, so just give it a watch. [[01:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=5232.34s)]
*  Yeah. Business owner follows thief on a bus, follower home, confronts her ass. So. [[01:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=5234.34s)]
*  So what did she steal? Watch this. [[01:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=5240.34s)]
*  She left and got on the bus, which my employee notified me about. [[01:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=5242.34s)]
*  So I drove to meet the bus guys. OK, so this raggedy ass bitch came into her and stole from my store. [[01:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=5247.34s)]
*  So for my store, OK, stop the touch. [[01:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=5258.34s)]
*  And we're going to follow her to her house because she says she's going to pay for it there. Right. [[01:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=5260.34s)]
*  Yeah. OK. Oh, my God. [[01:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=5265.34s)]
*  So enjoy the ride and we'll let you know where she lives. [[01:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=5268.34s)]
*  Let's play a game called Look in the Thieves First. [[01:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=5272.34s)]
*  Let's see what she has. [[01:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=5276.34s)]
*  Oh, she also took a skirt. Did you see that? [[01:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=5278.34s)]
*  That's the girl right there. [[01:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=5281.34s)]
*  Yes, she stole clothes. [[01:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=5283.34s)]
*  Imagine the shock on a thief's face. [[01:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=5290.34s)]
*  And they got it. Don't steal from small businesses. OK. [[01:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=5292.34s)]
*  OK. It's Chinese. OK. [[01:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=5295.34s)]
*  But wow, is that unbelievable? That's incredible. Good Lord. [[01:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=5299.34s)]
*  That's what it's just. It's interesting that like we're becoming our own police. [[01:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=5305.34s)]
*  It's like the police there, almost like the secondary part of the policing. [[01:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=5310.34s)]
*  It's like, well, yeah, it's just people taking into their own hands and using social media to call people out and go like, fuck this. [[01:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=5316.34s)]
*  Yeah, but it's like that for every. It's like just this. [[01:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=5323.34s)]
*  There's like this. It's like that for everything. [[01:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=5325.34s)]
*  It's like that on both sides. It's like that on if you're the criminal or if you're the victim, you know, it's just interesting how there's like social media provides this vigilante sort of comeuppance. [[01:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=5327.34s)]
*  Yes. Comeuppance access. What word am I thinking of, Zach? Am I making any sense? [[01:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=5340.34s)]
*  Comeuppance. I mean, justice. We're talking about, you know. [[01:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=5345.34s)]
*  Right. It's justice and injustice. But it's either way. [[01:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=5348.34s)]
*  Well, that's a catch 22 of social media. [[01:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=5352.34s)]
*  And that's like the extreme dichotomy of how it's like it can be the best tool ever or it can be a very negative tool. [[01:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=5354.34s)]
*  Yeah. You know what I'm saying? We'll be right back with more from. [[01:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=5360.34s)]
*  I think that's fine. But yeah, White Oprah's dude. [[01:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=5364.34s)]
*  White Oprah's would be the best band name. [[01:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=5368.34s)]
*  That'd be a sweet trilogy movie. The Black Steadmans. [[01:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=5372.34s)]
*  What else? Anything else in the news, Zach? I just wanted to see if there was anything else we wanted to chat about. [[01:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=5375.34s)]

*  I mean, the thing about covid is I just kind of evaluated my life and like I'm like 45 years old. [[01:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=5396.34s)]
*  Where am I going to? What's my next chapter? You know what I mean? [[01:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=5403.34s)]
*  I'm like I've already done a lot, you know, but I want to just do something where I don't know. [[01:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=5406.34s)]
*  I just came to terms with a lot of shit and a lot of baggage and why I was drinking so much and like why, you know. [[01:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=5413.34s)]
*  So I drank in Key West and then just came back full throttle where I was like, OK, I came. [[01:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=5418.34s)]
*  Well, I went home and I looked around my place and I'm like, why do I have all these shoes? [[01:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=5424.34s)]
*  Why do I have these clothes? I sold my Rolex. I sold my diamond chains. [[01:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=5429.34s)]
*  I sold everything. I sold half my shirts, almost all my shoes. [[01:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=5432.34s)]
*  I'm like this is just like just minimalized my life where I'm just like I just want to you don't need that much. [[01:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=5436.34s)]
*  I gave it away. I didn't you know, I just was like here, you know, have this. [[01:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=5442.34s)]

*  You know, it's like I don't want to go in there. [[01:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=5927.34s)]

*  I don't know if we've covered everything. [[01:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=5979.34s)]
*  Anything else you think we need to hit, Zach? Any good news going on? [[01:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=5981.34s)]
*  We had a lot of it. The last thing I was going to pull up. [[01:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=5985.34s)]
*  And you just mentioned this earlier about like, is it even worth going to college anymore? [[01:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=5988.34s)]
*  Is there was a study that one in four Gen Z ears plan on being an influencer. [[01:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=5992.34s)]
*  Wow. Oh, my God. And shockingly enough, in this study, the men are think they're more likely to be influencers than the women, and they're relying on it more. [[01:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=5996.34s)]
*  But do you see where the first of all, you have to understand there's going to be less because of automation. [[01:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=6006.34s)]
*  There will probably be less jobs in the future. Right. [[01:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=6012.34s)]
*  I was talking about this with Joe Rogan that they have at one point, it's going to come to the fact that you're going to have like everybody's going to have like a gig economy or is going to be an influencer. [[01:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=6015.34s)]
*  You're going to have like two Uber drivers holding each other at gunpoint to get the other person to be their fair. [[01:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=6027.34s)]
*  You know, it's like everybody's going to be an Uber driver or everybody's going to be an influencer. [[01:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=6035.34s)]
*  Watch me right now. You know, subscribe to my tits. [[01:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=6039.34s)]
*  You know, get in my like we're literally going to be fighting to have the other person be the consumer. [[01:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=6043.34s)]
*  I mean, we already are. But if if more actual jobs go away, you're going to have people hold subscribe to my pussy, you know, like, right. [[01:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=6052.34s)]
*  Yes, subscribe. Subscribe to my butthole. [[01:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=6061.34s)]
*  It's different than everybody else. [[01:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=6064.34s)]
*  But I mean, how many things can you influence? I don't even it's such a broad term. [[01:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=6068.34s)]
*  It's like you're an influencer. So what is that? [[01:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=6072.34s)]
*  You're just going to have billions of people just dancing and then, you know, I don't understand. [[01:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=6075.34s)]
*  Well, that's a good point, too. And also being an influencer, people are just on social media. [[01:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=6081.34s)]
*  So I think that's all that this means. Right. [[01:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=6085.34s)]
*  I mean, Zach, in a way, that's kind of all they're saying. [[01:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=6088.34s)]
*  You know, it's like they could be kind of saying that. Yeah. [[01:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=6090.34s)]
*  I mean, they're basically just saying that, like, I guess when they're looking at their future, I think these kids are realizing that they have to grow up like monetizing themselves in apps, which is like kind of fucked up. [[01:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=6093.34s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, we still need fucking doctors and lawyers like go to school. [[01:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=6104.34s)]
*  I mean, I just couldn't do it because I didn't have the money or the grades or the brain. [[01:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=6108.34s)]
*  Yeah. But if you if you're smart, you know, fucking go college. [[01:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=6112.34s)]
*  I'm not shitting on college at all. [[01:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=6116.34s)]
*  I mean, if you utilize it and it's tricky for kids, it always has been about what do you want to do? [[01:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=6119.34s)]
*  And you're 18. You're like, I don't fucking know, dude. [[01:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=6123.34s)]
*  But I mean, hopefully, like, you can find hopefully college can, if you're open to it, find you a path of like, you know, [[01:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=6126.34s)]
*  finding something that you want to do that can that college can facilitate. [[01:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=6133.34s)]
*  Yeah, I don't know. College is it seems fun because I love college sports, watching hoop and football. [[01:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=6136.34s)]
*  Like you see the games. Everybody's all fired up. My buddy went to my brother, went to Madison and you watch Madison like the House of Pain and they play and they all jump around like that would be fun just to go to college for that. [[01:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=6143.34s)]
*  Oh, yeah, I think that's one of the only to go to football games. [[01:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=6154.34s)]
*  That's one of the best experience, I think, over the years of traveling to do comedy is sometimes being in a city or a town where there's a good college game on that next day and you stay an extra day and you go. [[01:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=6158.34s)]
*  And you I remember you applied to Cracker Barrel to go to college or. [[01:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=6168.34s)]
*  Well, I applied to the third Technical Institute. [[01:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=6172.34s)]
*  Right. You know, it's where they make a lot of tech. [[01:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=6175.34s)]
*  It's where they make a lot of the condiments. [[01:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=6177.34s)]
*  Yeah. You know, but. [[01:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=6179.34s)]
*  But isn't that crazy, though, that that's it's like I even noticed my little niece the other day got a separate channel, like started her own like separate channel. [[01:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=6184.34s)]
*  And it's just like, this is this is just what it's part of life. [[01:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=6193.34s)]
*  It's like you have to have this other existence. [[01:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=6198.34s)]
*  That means almost more than your actual existence. [[01:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=6202.34s)]
*  What do you mean, like metaverse shit? I mean, well, you're fine. [[01:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=6207.34s)]
*  Yeah, like your your your your existence of online, your personality. [[01:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=6210.34s)]
*  Right. You can create sure. Yeah. [[01:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=6216.34s)]
*  I mean, you can create a life or a life that people see you. [[01:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=6218.34s)]
*  They think you live. You know what I mean? Right. [[01:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=6222.34s)]
*  But that's it's like that's become it feels like if that many people are going to think that they're going to be influencers, if then you're like, that's going to be a big part of don't judge me as a person. [[01:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=6224.34s)]
*  Judge whatever this idea of me is that I'm presenting, you know. [[01:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=6236.34s)]
*  Right. But people also thought like that because we're going to have hair like Motley Crue there for the rest of their lives. [[01:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=6239.34s)]
*  Good point. So I mean, shit goes in and out. [[01:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npImH3_aTEE&t=6244.34s)]
