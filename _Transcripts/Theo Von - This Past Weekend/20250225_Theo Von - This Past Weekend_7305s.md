# Bert Kreischer | This Past Weekend w/ Theo Von #565
**Theo Von - This Past Weekend:** [February 25, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c)
*  I have some new tour dates to tell you about. I'll be in Chicago, Illinois on April 24th [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=0.0s)]
*  at the Wynn Trust Arena, Fort Wayne, Indiana on April 26th at the Allen County War Memorial [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=4.88s)]
*  Coliseum, and Miami, Florida on May 10th at the Casella Center. All tickets at thetheovon.com. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=12.32s)]
*  Today's guest is a stand-up comedian, a podcaster, an actor. You know him from his [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=23.68s)]
*  shows Burt Cast and Two Bears, One Cave with Tom Segura. He's got a new special coming out on [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=29.52s)]
*  Netflix called Lucky, which premieres March 18th. I'm grateful to have my friend the machine [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=36.32s)]
*  here today, Mr. Burt Kreischer. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=43.12s)]
*  There's a woman out there teaching our kid how to ride a bike. I could do it in five minutes. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=59.52s)]
*  You want to do it? [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=70.24000000000001s)]
*  A buddy. It's part of my, what I'm working on in therapy. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=71.04s)]
*  Really? [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=75.28s)]
*  Let people have their own thing. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=75.68s)]
*  Yeah. I get my fingers in everything and I just was like, hey, here's what we do. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=77.84s)]
*  We take off the pedals, okay, and you teach him to just glide with his feet and lift his feet up. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=82.4s)]
*  That's how I did with both my girls. Then we go to a subtle decline and we do it that way with [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=87.04s)]
*  feet up the whole way. Then we put the pedals back on, teach him how to pedal. So easy. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=91.36000000000001s)]
*  Yeah. Riding a bike, the toughest thing I remember, well, first some guy who's teaching, [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=96.96000000000001s)]
*  you don't know him usually. In my neighborhood, you didn't know him. It was like some dude's dad [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=100.96000000000001s)]
*  would be out there drinking or something. He's like, I'll teach this little whatever, you know? [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=104.72s)]
*  You're like, well, that's not, that's a whole. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=109.12s)]
*  That's not how it works at all. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=111.60000000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=113.28s)]
*  Usually you definitely know the guy. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=113.52000000000001s)]
*  Well, yeah, but yes, but a lot of times you also don't know you. Some people, [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=115.2s)]
*  some places you don't know the guy, right? Or if your dad isn't there or whatever. So [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=118.64s)]
*  there's some guy who sets his beard down. He's like, I'll teach this little mother. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=122.08s)]
*  Or you know, I almost did that out front. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=125.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=127.2s)]
*  Yeah. Okay. That makes sense. That tracks. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=127.60000000000001s)]
*  Yeah. So then the net guy, like, so now suddenly there's some guy teaching, [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=129.44s)]
*  you don't even know or whatever. And then they get you going, right? And that part's good, [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=133.44s)]
*  but the scary part is then you realize you have to steer. And that's where a lot of people [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=138.48000000000002s)]
*  just bank right into a thing. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=143.44s)]
*  Two things at twice. You have to pedal and steer. And it's, and it's, it's counterintuitive. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=144.72s)]
*  My daughter, Isla, the first time I taught her how to ride a bike, I got her going, [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=149.6s)]
*  like pedals off, gliding pedals back on. Here we go. And boom, hit a BMW, hard as [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=154.48s)]
*  shit over the handlebars, body mark on top of the hood. And I was like, God. So then. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=160.95999999999998s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=166.16s)]
*  She goes, I'm good, dad. Second time we get her, she hits a trash can right away. I'm like, God, [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=167.2s)]
*  dang. And then third time she had a fire hydrant and then we realized she needed glasses. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=170.96s)]
*  Oh, yeah. Yeah. We got to get her glasses. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=175.6s)]
*  Yeah. That way. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=178.0s)]
*  Okay. She's dyslexic too. She hits so much shit. We got a video of her. She, she's just, [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=178.88s)]
*  that kid has been, are we rolling? Are we good? [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=183.92000000000002s)]
*  Huh? I don't know. Are we? [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=186.0s)]
*  Oh, you're good. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=187.04000000000002s)]
*  Okay. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=187.60000000000002s)]
*  We were, we, that kid rolled the dice on life so much, so much. Do you know the feeling of when [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=188.0s)]
*  you cut your bike front tire and it goes like this? She would, she would do that. That's how [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=193.28s)]
*  she rode a bike. She liked her stomach to drop. So she'd go, and George had a GoPro on her helmet [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=199.12s)]
*  and Isla did it and then went over the handlebars. That's the cutest video. George looks at me, [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=206.16s)]
*  dad, I got it. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=210.32s)]
*  Capture the footage. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=212.56s)]
*  Yeah. It was great. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=213.76s)]
*  Wow. You guys are a footage family. You've always been kind of a footage family then. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=214.56s)]
*  Yeah. But it was before content really. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=218.24s)]
*  Right. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=221.44s)]
*  Like, I mean, we, you know, I got an Instagram to not to, for professional reasons, I got [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=221.68s)]
*  Instagram to keep up with people I knew in high school and college. And then you're like, [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=227.28s)]
*  oh, in comics, cool. No one was posting videos of like promo videos. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=231.44s)]
*  No. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=235.36s)]
*  And then I shared everything about my family on everything. I remember the first time I realized [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=235.92000000000002s)]
*  maybe I was oversharing is I posted our Christmas card on Instagram and someone hit me up, guy we [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=241.76s)]
*  both know that we respect hit me up and he was like, dude, what are you doing? I was like, [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=247.84s)]
*  and it got like a million likes. And I was like, you know, I don't know, you get addicted to the [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=251.04s)]
*  likes. You're like, nice, killed it. And then you don't realize your kids, all their friends [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=254.88s)]
*  see that. And then you're putting, you're taking toothpaste out of the tube that you never put [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=259.44s)]
*  back in. But that was, we were creating content, not knowing what we were doing. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=263.04s)]
*  Oh, I see. You were saying like, you were like, maybe you were putting things that might have [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=267.6s)]
*  been too personal out there. You mean? [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=270.08s)]

*  Wait, I mean, I talked about Ila's period on one of my specials. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=271.92s)]
*  Oh, and you weren't there for the first period or whatever, were you? [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=274.4s)]

*  like if it's a neediness or whatever it is, but she got her period. And I mean, I talked about [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=298.08s)]
*  a special, but she called me from school and she's like, yo, it happened. I was like, yeah. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=302.79999999999995s)]

*  media, cause it's funny and no one, no one has a frame of reference for how big this is getting, [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=328.79999999999995s)]
*  you know? And you're just filming and you're laughing and everyone's laughing. And then [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=333.28s)]
*  Isla the next morning was like, yo, maybe we want to take that off social media. Maybe I don't want [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=337.12s)]
*  everyone I went to school with to know I got my period yesterday. And I was like, [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=340.88s)]
*  good call a 10 year old or 12 year old, whatever you are. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=343.76000000000005s)]

*  kind of remember, I think if somebody got their period in our neighborhood, people would just [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=349.92s)]
*  start calling them a whore or whatever, you know? Like I think people were just, [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=354.40000000000003s)]
*  yeah, people were more vulgar in our area. I think, you know, if anything happened, it was [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=358.64000000000004s)]
*  everybody always made it. You feel ashamed of no matter what happened to you, you know? [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=363.68s)]
*  Oh, okay. Yeah. I've been talking about shame a lot in therapy. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=367.52s)]
*  Have you been? Yeah. You just said, well, you just said that you, you saw somebody who was [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=370.8s)]
*  trying to teach her a kid to ride a bike. Cause I heard something going on out there. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=374.16s)]
*  I heard something that sounded kind of Mexican or whatever happened outside. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=376.96000000000004s)]
*  It was very Mexican. Yeah. Yeah. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=379.52s)]
*  I heard like something kind of Mexican happened outside earlier and I was like, [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=381.12s)]
*  Oh, I wonder what's going on, but I'm not going to get involved. I got to work right now. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=384.4s)]

*  Yeah. And you were going to get involved. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=391.2s)]
*  I wanted to get involved. And I just was like, no, this is their life. What am I doing? [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=392.56s)]
*  Like what part, what need do I have to jump in, make it an event, event like, ah, and then, [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=396.88s)]

*  days. I had a therapist tell me one time you have FOMO. Wow. I was like, that doesn't sound like a [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=534.88s)]
*  therapy. Yeah. That, well, I mean, it's just crazy. You would, yeah, I guess you hear something you [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=539.28s)]

*  an air vent. Oh dude, have you seen that? There's a great, um, meth tribute video where [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=587.2s)]
*  a guy shows up through a floor air vent in somebody's trailer. That shit was something else, [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=594.8000000000001s)]
*  dude. When I was a kid, my buddy, Jeff, he had like a lot of violent tendencies or whatever. I [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=601.36s)]
*  don't know what happened to him, but he would get so angry as parents would send him to his room [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=605.44s)]
*  and he would beat the drywall out of the walls of his room. And every year for Christmas, [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=609.6s)]
*  they would get the drywall redone in his room. Oh, that's very sweet of him. And he would listen [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=614.24s)]
*  to that song. You gotta keep them separated. I just met those dudes. Do you know that they got, [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=618.16s)]
*  they said, I was talking to the, uh, to Dexter and, uh, and fucking slinky, it's not slinky. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=630.8s)]
*  Noodles? What? Noodles, Dexter noodles. And they said, you know, that, uh, a lot of white supremacists [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=636.88s)]
*  adopted that song. Ooh. Yeah. You know another song white supremacists adopted? Uh, these boots [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=642.64s)]
*  are made for walking and that's just what they'll do. But the white supremacists, one of these days, [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=648.48s)]
*  these boots are gonna walk all over you. Jews. Oh, stop. Yeah. Damn. There's a, yeah, yeah. I heard [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=654.0s)]
*  that in the old school. You ever watched the old school Ku Klux Klan videos? They didn't do a music [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=661.68s)]
*  video. Did they? I don't think so. I haven't seen that if they did. There would be like the videos [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=668.48s)]
*  where it's like the one British guy infiltrates the Klan and he's like, so I'd like to talk to [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=673.52s)]
*  your son. And he's like, so do you have a problem with black people? Oh, I hear you're talking about, [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=678.72s)]
*  dude. Louis Thoreau. Oh, Louis Thoreau. Yeah. And then he'd go to like their fucking, their big barn [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=683.36s)]
*  and they're burning his cross. And he's like, I feel a little uncomfortable. This isn't really [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=687.9200000000001s)]
*  my cup of tea. Oh, the cross is a little warm. Can you turn down the heat? I'm a little close [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=692.5600000000001s)]
*  to the cross. Can we do smaller crosses? Maybe spread them out evenly by the tables. Kind of [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=697.76s)]
*  like a heat lamp. He goes, actually, my wife's a bit cold. Could you spark up a small cross near her? [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=703.2s)]
*  Do you think that was the first cross burning? They're like, well, we want to get us right here, [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=710.08s)]
*  but there's people on the side. So like, let's get spread it out. Like the fire's too centralized. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=714.08s)]
*  Well, I think that's why you, that's probably why they burn across. It's kind of the perfect [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=720.48s)]
*  fucking heat lamp. I don't understand. I mean, I'm sure it's ominous to see a cross burning in [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=725.0400000000001s)]
*  your front yard, but I'd be, if I saw that and I'm like two in the morning, I'd be like fucking sweet. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=730.8000000000001s)]

*  too. I think he's done a lot of documentaries. He's done a ton. But he does like gossip documentaries. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=753.28s)]
*  You know? Yeah. It's always, and it's a lit. It was almost a lit. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=758.8s)]
*  Will the skin hurt in the crowd? How about Elijah could be handy for cross burnings. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=765.8399999999999s)]
*  That's not cool. Can you say a big lighter for a cross? No, no, you have to use a torch or something. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=773.28s)]
*  How come? I can't use a big lighter for a cross burning. Hang on. Hang on. Let's hang on. Pick [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=778.8000000000001s)]
*  that apart. That is fucking hilarious. If they built the cross, it's covered in fucking kerosene [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=783.76s)]
*  and you'll see a guy at the bottom. I can't get it. Hang on. It's too windy. Like someone trying [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=789.28s)]
*  to light a cigarette behind the comedy store. Hey, somebody comes stay in like this. Dude, one time [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=796.32s)]
*  I was at this party out in Franklin, Tennessee and they had like a huge bonfire. Right? And so [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=803.6s)]
*  they had one black guy that was at the party. Right? And they sent him to pour the gasoline on [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=809.1999999999999s)]
*  all of this huge. I mean, it was a huge pile of sticks. You had to climb up. I mean, it was [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=816.56s)]
*  humongous. It was probably a little gas goes a long way. I agree. And it was 40 feet wide and [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=819.68s)]
*  probably 20 feet high. This pile. And I was like, and there was American flags everywhere. I was [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=824.64s)]

*  Being with your Jewish friend and go, Hey, there's something in the back of my oven. Can you [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=835.4399999999999s)]
*  climb in and see if you can get it out? You're like, no, fuck. No. Well, that's why Jews invented [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=838.32s)]
*  the self-cleaning oven. They're like, we're not doing that. Sure. We're not falling for that again. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=842.5600000000001s)]
*  Oh, oh, they're going to make us take that out. Probably. They can't, huh? Well, unless the Jews [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=851.2s)]
*  actually invented the self-cleaning oven, then it's just fucking. That's just factual information. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=857.12s)]
*  Dude, I can't, so I can't believe you're in therapy. So that's going on. Yeah. I like it. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=863.52s)]
*  You do. I didn't do therapy. I quit therapy for a period of time because I was talking too much, [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=867.92s)]
*  meaning two bears, bird cast, something's burning and tour. So every day I'm talking like four hours [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=872.4s)]

*  physically want to talk anymore. And then, uh, and then when I took time off, I was like, like second, [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=883.68s)]
*  I took time off. Like my first week, I got really depressed. So I was like, I don't know. Really? [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=888.4799999999999s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. But are you able to figure out like what that depression, I mean, because otherwise [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=892.8s)]
*  it's not torn. Oh, it's just not, not being on the go, not being, not being, not being on the go, [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=897.6s)]

*  maybe you just don't get burned out. No, I don't get burned. I don't get burned out. What was [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=914.16s)]

*  of those places. I can't afford you. I don't know about that. There wasn't, there was a second where [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=1002.64s)]
*  I could have gotten you and Schultz were the two like, two kind of like white whales. It was been, [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=1007.6s)]

*  Schultz called me directly and he was like, I got your offer and I respectfully declined. But then [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=1025.68s)]
*  his agent was like, you can't afford him. And I was like, okay, I get it. But you want your friends [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=1029.76s)]
*  to blow up. It would have been cool. But it's like, you don't ever want someone to take a pay cut to [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=1033.84s)]
*  come do something. Yeah. Or sometimes it's also just a time cut. It's like, since we've been podcasting [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=1036.88s)]
*  more, it just takes so much time. And then I have to do it here and Nashville. It's just like the back [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=1042.16s)]

*  Like think about like walking with a friend. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=1094.8000000000002s)]
*  Do you have any top 10 hobbies? Yeah. Walking with a friend is not a hobby. It isn't? Cause immediately [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=1098.0s)]
*  I go, why don't we turn into a podcast? Here's the beautiful thing about podcasting. Okay. And so [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=1102.16s)]
*  let's scrap, like ignore that podcasting is a business. When are me and you going to get a [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=1106.88s)]
*  chance to sit down for an hour and just hang out with and go, you can't answer your phone, can't [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=1112.64s)]
*  look at your phone. Let's just talk. For the rest of our lives, probably never till we're older. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=1117.44s)]
*  Or if you have something you want to promote, maybe we can do it over at my house. But it's like, [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=1121.44s)]
*  it's kind of fucked up. I'll never get a chance to sit down with Kevin Nealon for an hour. I sat [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=1125.3600000000001s)]
*  with him for an hour and 30 minutes. I got to ask him all the questions I ever wanted to ask. Danny [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=1129.76s)]
*  Trejo, Travis Parker, you know, Jelly. It's like, I see Jelly. Jelly is a little different. Cause I [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=1132.96s)]
*  see him and I ended up spending a lot of time with him. Yeah. He's somehow so, he finds, he's so [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=1138.32s)]
*  accessible in a weird way. Yeah. But podcasting, I don't look at that as work. I look at his [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=1143.3600000000001s)]
*  opportunity to hang out with my friends, you know, and get to know other people, other men. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=1147.92s)]
*  Oh, for sure. Yeah. And I think a lot of people maybe don't get as much time with that. And so [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=1152.96s)]
*  that's why they listen to podcasts too. It's like, Ooh, you know, a lot of people don't like what [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=1157.8400000000001s)]
*  you said. Maybe they don't get as much time as that. So that's why they listen. They're listening [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=1162.96s)]
*  more to podcasts. I think some of this wireless and it's like, Oh, I want to hear a conversation [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=1167.1200000000001s)]
*  about this thing. And so that's what I'm listening to where I want to hear about a conversation. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=1170.3200000000002s)]
*  That's funny. Or I don't get to hang out with Tim Dillon and Rogan together. So you got to [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=1174.08s)]
*  hear. I never, I never do. So it's fun when I listen to the two of them talk, cause they, [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=1178.6399999999999s)]
*  they have smart brains in a different way than me. Like I'll never think the way they think. [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=1182.48s)]
*  No, they're the best. Dude. Tim Dillon is so original. It's unbelievable. He is my favorite [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=1186.1599999999999s)]

*  they just moved the lines over to a different character. But when I watched it back, the guy [[01:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=4117.44s)]
*  had two lines, and I would have been there for 12 weeks. It just wasn't a good fit, right? [[01:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=4120.4s)]
*  The first movie I ever had a friend did, Tom did a movie with Mark Wahlberg. He was there for five [[01:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=4125.5199999999995s)]
*  weeks. I was like, oh, cool. So you're in a lot of scenes. He's like, I'm in two scenes. I was like, [[01:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=4133.759999999999s)]
*  you're there for five fucking weeks? He's like, yeah, as part of making a movie. I was like, [[01:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=4139.36s)]
*  well, I guess I'm not making a movie. And then I was like, I'm not going to fucking sit in a hotel [[01:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=4142.639999999999s)]
*  for five weeks? You got to be kidding me. Yeah, that was the thing. It was a long time. It was [[01:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=4146.88s)]
*  in Atlanta. And also, I didn't know anybody on the set except for Mary Lynn Rice, who was there. [[01:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=4153.6s)]
*  And I'd met only Chris Pratt just through Instagram messages. So I'd never met him. [[01:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=4157.68s)]
*  So that's an easy Texas and then- Yeah, it was chill. And I actually did call the director too, [[01:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=4162.88s)]
*  and I called him and just shared off that. And they were cool about it. But then there was a [[01:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=4167.52s)]
*  thing in Hollywood, this guy might back out of your movie. So I was like, I don't fucking care, [[01:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=4173.44s)]
*  dude. As long as I was cool with Chris and everything was fine, it was fine with me. [[01:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=4177.599999999999s)]
*  But that's when I realized, oh, I can't do something if it's not my own thing. And I'm not [[01:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=4182.639999999999s)]
*  going to be able to say, oh, we're keeping that or we're not keeping that or I don't want to be [[01:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=4187.679999999999s)]
*  seen like that or this sort of thing. Then I just can't do that for me. It's just how I work. [[01:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=4192.32s)]
*  When I got back from Serbia, someone had written a part in a TV show for me. And they texted me, [[01:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=4196.5599999999995s)]
*  I wrote a part for you. And I was like, oh, I'm going to do it. He's like, we haven't even read [[01:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=4201.28s)]
*  it. And I was like, I know that, but it's not my show. He was like, but hold on, hang on. I wrote [[01:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=4204.96s)]
*  it for you. And I went, okay, I don't know what to tell you. But I can just tell you that if I go [[01:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=4209.44s)]
*  on to your show, I'm going to have feelings and I'm probably not going to be great. And I'm going [[01:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=4214.4s)]
*  to be in a fucking different city from my family. And I just got back from Serbia and I kind of want [[01:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=4218.4800000000005s)]
*  to go on tour and I kind of want to do my podcast. And I kind of want to go on to another set and [[01:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=4222.56s)]
*  then play a fat guy that fucking want to eat snorts coke or whatever. And so he was like, [[01:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=4227.04s)]
*  I was like, and I'm friends with you. And right now it seems to we're friends. Let's just keep [[01:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=4233.28s)]
*  the friendship. And then I don't have to work together. It's funny because it's like, as if I [[01:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=4236.8s)]
*  was younger, I would have been totally opposite. I would have been like, yeah, yeah, you're my [[01:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=4240.88s)]
*  friend, write a part for me. And now I'm just like, no, please don't write a part for me. [[01:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=4245.2s)]
*  Yeah, I think it's, I'm trying to think a little bit more about it. I mean, this was like, I just [[01:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=4248.32s)]
*  remember thinking because we wrote it and then we, we, nobody wanted to direct it. Nobody wanted to [[01:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=4253.6s)]
*  help us with it. No agent, no producers. Are you kidding? Can we for anyone listening, that's how [[01:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=4258.64s)]
*  tough Hollywood is right now. Right now they are not making movies. No, I think it is. And also [[01:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=4265.92s)]
*  like they don't want, I don't know if they don't want certain people to have voices. It seemed [[01:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=4271.4400000000005s)]
*  easier for other people to make movies. Right. I'll say that. But also, wait, wait, I know what [[01:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=4274.400000000001s)]
*  you're saying. Yeah. Yeah. It seemed easier for other people to make movies. But you mean, [[01:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=4280.0s)]
*  you mean you two cisgendered white, privilege males had a hard time selling a movie in Hollywood. [[01:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=4285.92s)]
*  But that's the funniest fucking thing that there's, cause there is semi-truth to that. But, [[01:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=4292.64s)]
*  but also we have had opportunities our entire life. But also it's like you talk to any fucking [[01:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=4298.16s)]
*  writer, any writer in Hollywood who's like 50, a dude who's white, they cannot get a job. [[01:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=4302.56s)]
*  Like they cannot work. And they're, and they lose, and these are all liberals. Like you gotta [[01:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=4309.92s)]
*  realize a Hollywood liberal writer, man, he's fucking storming the Capitol about those goddamn [[01:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=4314.88s)]
*  scripts. That's crazy. It's crazy. It's I talked to any of them. They're all like fucking dude, [[01:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=4320.88s)]
*  whatever's happening in Hollywood. I was like, you've had a good run. Yeah. I think, well, [[01:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=4325.6s)]
*  I just then it was like, well, we have to do, it was like, I don't like thinking that [[01:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=4330.64s)]
*  if you say I can't do it, there's a part of me that wants to just show you that I can do it. [[01:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=4334.959999999999s)]
*  Right. Like I don't, I'm not a great actor. Right. I know that. And that's fine with me. [[01:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=4340.719999999999s)]
*  I wouldn't say that. Well, I wouldn't say that. I have some, it's not real. [[01:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=4344.799999999999s)]
*  I have some moments that are good in this thing, but it's not a therapy movie. You're awesome. [[01:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=4347.599999999999s)]
*  That's sweet of you. It was easier for me to play like a disgruntled person kind of, [[01:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=4351.599999999999s)]
*  then I think, um, like a dumb buddy kind of thing. It's for some reason I've felt like that, [[01:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=4355.44s)]
*  but then also I'm like going back and looking at the things and I'm like thinking of what else [[01:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=4362.8s)]
*  needs to be in this scene. My mind's kind of like all over the place, but I do think that it's funny. [[01:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=4366.96s)]
*  The script is super funny. Um, I'm curious to see how it was shot, how that plays out and stuff. So, [[01:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=4371.84s)]
*  and I'm just glad that I think when I look back on my life, you know, I'll be glad that I got to do [[01:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=4378.0s)]
*  a movie with David Spade and, and it's like, yeah, we've funded ourselves. We funded ourselves. We [[01:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=4384.0s)]
*  did like we did it all. It's like, it was crazy. Wild to me because you guys are, I mean, David is [[01:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=4390.96s)]
*  a, David is a legend. David Spade is like, I always think he's a legend when you look at like SNL, [[01:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=4395.84s)]
*  right? Did you watch 50 years? I was there. You were there? No, I was there for the 50th. Uh, [[01:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=4403.2s)]
*  I was there Friday and Saturday night. Okay. Um, but when you watch it, it's pretty epic. You know, [[01:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=4409.36s)]
*  I will say SNL's 50th is a lot better if you're 50 because you watched a lot of it. Yeah. If you're, [[01:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=4414.16s)]
*  if you're 20 years old, you're like, I don't get why these racist, like where's Timothy Chalamet? [[01:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=4420.24s)]
*  Yeah. Where's Timothy Chalamet? How come Pete Davidson is not in more sketches? Where's, [[01:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=4424.88s)]
*  where's fucking, you know, uh, chaperone and, uh, but when you watch it and you're older, [[01:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=4428.5599999999995s)]
*  you're like, Oh, I remember Eddie Murphy, Eddie Murphy and Will Ferrell and Kenan Thompson were [[01:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=4434.639999999999s)]
*  fucking gold. Eddie Murphy doing, uh, uh, uh, uh, Tracy Morgan. Did you see that? I saw the skit [[01:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=4441.28s)]
*  with Eddie Murphy and Tracy, black jeopardy. You mean? Yeah. Where Eddie Murphy was playing [[01:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=4451.04s)]
*  Tracy Morgan next to Tracy Morgan. It was so funny. I didn't pick up that. That's what it was. Oh, [[01:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=4454.96s)]
*  did you see it? Yeah. Yeah. I saw this right here. Yeah. See the name Tracy underneath it. Oh, [[01:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=4461.36s)]
*  now I get it. Wait, what did you think he was doing? I didn't know what he was doing. I just [[01:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=4468.56s)]
*  thought he was doing Tracy Chapman or whatever. No, it wasn't Tracy Chapman. It was, this was my [[01:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=4473.200000000001s)]
*  favorite sketch ever. We can't play it because it'll, yeah, they will blame it. Sorry. But it, [[01:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=4478.8s)]
*  dude, it is, it, it was great. What was I saying? But David Spade is like, when you look at, so when [[01:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=4484.0s)]
*  you look at comedy history, right? Yeah. When they, when they talk about comedy history, now it's [[01:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=4489.52s)]
*  kind of, it's kind of interesting, I think, because you look back at the last 50 years. Yeah. And [[01:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=4494.08s)]
*  there's only like a handful of names, but, but, but legends that'll like Belzer, he'll be remembered. [[01:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=4499.6s)]
*  Richard Belzer? Yeah. And Larry David, Jerry Seinfeld, these, Eddie Murphy, Bill, Richard [[01:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=4506.4s)]
*  Pryor, Sam Kinison, Karl LeBeau will be remembered. Like they're, he was one of the outlaws of comedy. [[01:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=4512.48s)]
*  And then when you look at our generation, we're so thick with comics, like so thick. There's so many [[01:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=4517.2s)]
*  fucking comics right now that a lot of us are going to get forgotten and lost in conversation. [[01:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=4522.96s)]
*  David Spade will not be lost in conversation. Out of all the SNL people, he, he has had one of the most [[01:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=4527.36s)]
*  probably fucking crystal clear, pristine, hysterical, his movies will fucking forever be [[01:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=4535.04s)]
*  talked about. Tommy Boy, Black Sheep, Meet Joe Dirt, the fucking all, he's a legend. And so make [[01:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=4545.04s)]
*  a movie with him is like, that's the coolest thing you ever, like you're ever going to get to do. [[01:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=4553.12s)]
*  Yeah. That's what I felt like. I was like, I just, I have to do it. And we made it ourselves. It's [[01:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=4557.12s)]
*  like, we made it. It's like, we don't have anybody telling us what to do. And that's what I realized. [[01:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=4561.5199999999995s)]
*  I was like, oh, if I, if we say it went in the script and it went in the script and then went on [[01:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=4565.84s)]
*  the screen, if I had to go through a beat on a set to go ask somebody for permission to do it that [[01:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=4569.28s)]
*  way, then I wouldn't be able to do it. Right. I just, I wouldn't, I, I, I, like you're saying, [[01:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=4574.8s)]
*  I just know it would not react well with me viscerally. And if someone's like, Theo, I don't [[01:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=4579.28s)]
*  get it. You'd be like, hold on, hang on. I hit dingers. Like, like I, what I do is just tell jokes [[01:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=4583.4400000000005s)]
*  and I'm just funny. So trust me that if I think it's funny, let me just try. And then a lot of [[01:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=4588.400000000001s)]
*  people were like, ah, I don't know. Yeah. I couldn't have, especially like when you see a lot of the [[01:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=4592.8s)]
*  funny, like, but also I got to see how this thing is, how it looks when it's done. Like I have no [[01:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=4598.08s)]
*  fucking clue. The script is super funny. We put all our own jokes in it. We wrote it for two years. [[01:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=4602.32s)]
*  Like we definitely so, but I have no clue how it goes from doing the scenes, which are all done out [[01:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=4607.679999999999s)]
*  of order to then it being an actual, you know, how it like that, I cannot, my brain can't metric or [[01:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=4613.28s)]
*  like figure all that out. Like, um, but we had some funny, but yeah, like Nate Diaz has a role. [[01:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=4620.96s)]
*  I saw Nate posted about it today. Tim Dylan has a place. Uh, the manager, Bobby Lee came in and did [[01:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=4626.08s)]
*  a guest star. Yep. We got, uh, William McCullough, William Montgomery, Montgomery Casey Rockets, [[01:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=4633.2s)]
*  some of the kill Tony guys. And there's some others, some other also like great actors and stuff, [[01:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=4638.32s)]
*  but then we also didn't want to overdo it and have everybody you knew there's Spadey right there. And, [[01:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=4641.92s)]
*  uh, and Nate Diaz, dude, fucking hilarious. I saw a picture I saw. Oh yeah. That was cool, dude. [[01:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=4646.72s)]
*  That was so much fun. And I think I'll look back and be like, man, this thing was cost you a ton of [[01:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=4653.6s)]
*  money and it wasn't worth it, but man, you had a fucking good time. I think when I, when I, when I [[01:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=4658.08s)]
*  did, uh, when I did the machine, the very first time I was like, I'm not going to drink. It's Chris [[01:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=4663.12s)]
*  Avila right there. That's Nate's buddy. Um, but it's, I mean, it's a real movie. Like when you're [[01:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=4667.6s)]
*  there, you're like, damn, this is a real movie. Yeah. And I have one thing I got on set was ice [[01:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=4673.12s)]
*  bath and sauna. Really? There's a portable company and they have ice bath and sauna and they bring [[01:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=4678.56s)]

*  coming out to play or whatever. You start to see that coming to the surface, like a fish coming [[01:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=4778.0s)]
*  to the surface. Sometimes, sometimes you see that sometimes people lose weight and they're like, [[01:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=4781.92s)]
*  and you're like, I liked your fat. Oh yeah. I knew a guy like that. He used to clean the pool [[01:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=4786.0s)]

*  library when you were a kid. It was basically just like, it was like a couple thousand square feet of [[01:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=5250.72s)]
*  you hiding from a lady who's like obsessed with Voltaire or whatever. And you and your friends [[01:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=5255.36s)]
*  were just in there being loud. There was like one other person in a wheelchair in there. It like [[01:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=5260.32s)]
*  never made any fucking sense. They're just in there like in the, they're just like wandering [[01:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=5264.72s)]
*  the halls of the old internet or whatever. Like they wanted to teach us the Dewey Decimal system [[01:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=5269.12s)]
*  so bad when we were kids. The library was always ridiculous. I felt like what was I going to ask [[01:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=5273.68s)]
*  you about? Oh, so yeah, the, yeah. I wonder if people would watch this stairway to Olympics or [[01:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=5278.0s)]
*  if it would be too much for people. Why not? Because you're going to get people that are [[01:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=5282.96s)]
*  going to be risky. No, but why even have the regular Olympics? Well, regular Olympics are [[01:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=5288.400000000001s)]
*  regular. You know, everybody, the playing field is even playing fields even when you use drugs. [[01:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=5292.64s)]
*  Yeah. Right. I mean, I mean, why honestly, like if you're like, okay, [[01:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=5297.4400000000005s)]

*  and you're like, Oh, what? Put that one on. It's like, I mean, it's just like, like supply and demand. [[01:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=5317.12s)]
*  What do you want to watch? You know, a guy sprint, like sprinting is pretty cool, right? The sprinters [[01:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=5321.92s)]

*  it's like the natural bodybuilding versus terror. Why would you ever put the two together? I want [[01:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=5344.96s)]
*  to see the big ones. But I just worry about their ramifications. Like if somebody's but I guess if [[01:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=5349.12s)]
*  they want to do it, but you're going to blow your body out. How great was baseball when Mark McGuire [[01:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=5354.64s)]
*  and Sammy Sosa were? How great was baseball? To your point, it was so fucking great. And then they [[01:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=5359.04s)]

*  have to play. They have to do the Olympics. And it's just like this. It's like going up two [[01:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=5441.76s)]

*  game. I challenge Israel Adesanya to as a joke. But just as like I would love to fight him. But [[01:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=5458.16s)]
*  we both got to drink 12 beers first. And Izzy was like, I talked to Izzy about it. And he was like, [[01:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=5464.08s)]
*  I'm not going to lie. It'll be an interesting fight because he's like, I'm not a big drinker. [[01:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=5469.44s)]
*  So I'd be fucking wasted. And I was like, I'm 12 beers. I knew anything to me. Like, what if you put [[01:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=5473.12s)]
*  Shane Gillis and and like and like and Izzy is a perfect example because he doesn't drink. But [[01:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=5478.08s)]
*  Shane Gillis gonna drink 12 beers and not feel a thing. Yeah. Like, oh, I think it'd be. I think [[01:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=5486.32s)]
*  Izzy would beat the ever living shit out of both of you guys. To be honest, first of all. Yeah, [[01:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=5491.68s)]

*  giving you each 12 beers. We haven't increased our level at all. We're trying to diminish his. [[01:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=5505.2s)]
*  But even after 12 beers, he still is a professional fighter. Yeah. So that's a part [[01:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=5512.96s)]
*  that I'd be risque. He came to my New Zealand show and he and I had said it a couple of times [[01:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=5518.4s)]
*  on two bears. I wanted to do it. And he came up and they're like, I get a text. They're like, [[01:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=5523.12s)]

*  like find like four exercises, do four reps of them, you know, and do that four times and then I'll do [[01:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=5877.04s)]

*  hair that I lost because of stress actually grew back. I think I just had so much. You look like [[01:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=5950.72s)]

*  You had also my favorite musician right now, one of anyway, Steven Wilson Jr. was on your podcast. [[01:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=5967.92s)]
*  How great is he? Every bones and tether. You want to change my name. Gotta drain my blood. [[01:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=5974.5599999999995s)]
*  Everything I am, everything he walks. He's the best. He is really great. I'm a song. I'm a song. [[01:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=5985.679999999999s)]
*  I know you love that one. I've listened to that one a couple of times. It's not my favorite. [[01:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=5993.04s)]
*  You sure? I've listened to it because I know you like it. Yeah, I've listened to it. [[01:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=5996.32s)]
*  And I know how much you love it. I love it, dude. Because it's so beautiful that it... [[01:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=6001.28s)]
*  I remember the song I lost my virginity to. I remember the song I got my first car to. I [[01:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=6005.5199999999995s)]
*  remember the song that Leanne and I fell in love to. I remember the songs for me. I get very [[01:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=6008.96s)]
*  emotional listening to music. I mean, every one of these episodes, I'm like, yo, don't put the [[01:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=6013.28s)]
*  camera on me. I'm crying. Did you hear what happened when I did it with him? He goes to start playing [[01:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=6017.04s)]
*  and he starts playing on the song. And he goes, and he had to stop. He goes, Bert, can you please [[01:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=6022.639999999999s)]
*  not cry like that? I cried out loud. But man, music for me is so emotional. Red Clay Strays [[01:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=6027.68s)]
*  came over to my house and played. And I was like, shut the fuck up. Dude, Goose is one of my favorite [[01:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=6033.04s)]
*  bands in the world. You know Goose? I've got to listen to them. No, my best friend Scott loves them, [[01:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=6040.4800000000005s)]
*  but I haven't listened to them that much. I've been very blessed with the opportunities of having [[01:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=6043.52s)]
*  these. This band is so fucking great. But I've been very blessed to have all these guys and girls [[01:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=6050.400000000001s)]
*  come over and play music for me because I just I love music. And I think sometimes I'm good at a [[01:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=6056.16s)]
*  podcast, like if I'm talking to you, because I don't know. But sometimes with younger comics, [[01:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=6061.44s)]
*  I'm at the best because I don't like, I don't know. I'm not great, you know? But with musicians, [[01:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=6066.5599999999995s)]
*  I'm so much, I'm so fascinated by their process and who they are. And I don't know anything about [[01:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=6072.4s)]
*  them. And you get to kind of deep dive them. And then you've had some great fucking musicians on. [[01:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=6076.96s)]
*  I mean, I saw Billy Strings live the other night. Billy Strings. He took me fishing one day too. [[01:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=6082.96s)]
*  He's such a special guy. Yeah, he's just the most, he's so normal. He's so not a celebrity. [[01:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=6088.08s)]
*  He's just a normal guy. Do you think you're not a celebrity? I think I don't like the celebrity part [[01:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=6097.68s)]
*  of it. I don't see a lot of value in it. But like you get a lot of access to cool shit. It's a mirage. [[01:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=6102.88s)]
*  That's the only thing I see that you like about celebrity is, and I wouldn't say that you like it, [[01:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=6111.120000000001s)]
*  but I noticed that you travel and go see the events you want to see. You get to go do everything. [[01:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=6115.04s)]
*  I look at yours, I'm like, you're at UFC, you're at fucking Jelly Roll show, you're at Kid Rock [[01:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=6121.92s)]
*  show, you're at the fucking Republican National Commitment or whatever the thing, the inauguration. [[01:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=6128.56s)]
*  I look at that and I go, that only comes with celebrity. You don't get that if you're just [[01:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=6134.8s)]
*  talented. You got to be famous and talented. And so I think I see you leveraging that in the best [[01:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=6139.92s)]
*  way is that you're filling your interests. I think I saw you with Caitlin Clark. Oh yeah. And I was [[01:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=6145.76s)]
*  like, that only comes with celebrity. And so- Well, I'm a fan of hers. I'm a, I'm friends with her [[01:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=6152.0s)]
*  boyfriend. Really? Connor. Yeah. Connor Clark? No, Connor. It'd be crazy. It'd be illegal, it sounds [[01:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=6156.96s)]
*  like. Connor McCaffrey. Wait, Nolan, is she dating Christian McCaffrey's brother? No, I don't think [[01:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=6163.36s)]
*  they're related. But we went up to watch Caitlin, Me and Caleb and then that's how we met Connor. [[01:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=6170.48s)]
*  You interviewed Jessie Murphy? Jessie Murph. Jessie Murph? Yeah, she's the best. That's the little [[01:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=6175.839999999999s)]
*  girl that sings Cigarette Card with Jelly Roll. Oh, Wild Ones. Wild Ones. I go, [[01:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=6180.639999999999s)]
*  I got a thing for the 45 on a man with him about 102. Always smoking something, got me worried [[01:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=6190.8s)]
*  about nothing and he ain't got nothing to lose. I got a thing for the wild on the belly. [[01:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=6198.88s)]
*  I texted, I DM'd her one time. I was like, I was like, I should not love this song as much as I [[01:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=6209.04s)]
*  love it. What did you think of the Super Bowl halftime show? The Super Bowl halftime show, [[01:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=6215.76s)]
*  I tweeted about it that I thought it was boring, right? And I only know like, I'm not a big Kendrick [[01:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=6220.4800000000005s)]
*  listener, right? And then a couple days ago I ended up taking down my tweet actually. I just felt like, [[01:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=6228.400000000001s)]
*  well, I guess I felt like, why am I judging this? I don't fucking know. You know what I'm saying? [[01:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=6234.08s)]
*  I think sometimes you forget that people could make a big deal out of you tweet something that [[01:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=6238.240000000001s)]
*  you can't just say like, fuck them whatever you want without some people having reactions to it, [[01:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=6243.04s)]
*  maybe. Well, dude, I mean, I think it, I'm sure you've had gotten negative feedback in your life [[01:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=6246.88s)]
*  and you just go, well, that wasn't my intent. And then if you ever talk to that person, they're like, [[01:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=6252.56s)]
*  oh, I didn't know you were going to see it. And you're like, like if Kendrick might be a big fan [[01:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=6256.56s)]
*  of yours and he sees it and then he's like, oh, fuck. I know that sucks, right? Yeah. Right. I [[01:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=6259.76s)]
*  thought about that. But then I also, no, I just thought about like, why am I, I think like two [[01:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=6263.92s)]
*  days that I was like, why am I, why am I judging this guy? And then people are going to judge me. [[01:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=6268.32s)]
*  Like what kind of energy am I really creating? I don't think that's what I thought when I was [[01:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=6274.799999999999s)]
*  tweeting and I was just like, oh, this is fucking, you know, I just, it was, it didn't feel like it [[01:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=6278.08s)]
*  was for me. I don't know. I didn't know enough of his songs. I think that was the, I mean, there's, [[01:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=6281.679999999999s)]
*  I think there was a bunch of issues. I think number one is his catalog. His catalog is very big in the [[01:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=6286.08s)]
*  culture and in white culture, I don't think there's enough crossover. He's only have like two [[01:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=6290.799999999999s)]
*  crossover songs. I think he played both of them, but like, I'll tell you being there, I was sitting [[01:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=6294.72s)]
*  next to Jameis Winston when it happened and man, we loved it. It was really fun in the stadium. [[01:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=6298.8s)]
*  I made it on TV. It didn't translate, but it was really fun in the stadium. The interesting person's [[01:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=6304.8s)]
*  take was Kid Rock's take. Did you hear his? He was like, cause you know, Kid Rock's, you know. [[01:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=6309.04s)]
*  I remember he shot those Pepsi's up when that fellow was drinking them gay Pepsi's or whatever. [[01:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=6314.96s)]
*  He's got, I'm gonna talk him out. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Bud Light. [[01:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=6319.280000000001s)]
*  Oh, Bud Light. I'm sorry. But his take was, he did this for the culture. [[01:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=6324.88s)]
*  Kid Rock's take was pretty insightful. Kid Rock grew up loving it in hip hop, in hip hop. And so [[01:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=6331.92s)]
*  his take was really kind of insightful. He's like, yeah, we did this for the culture. He did this [[01:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=6337.76s)]
*  as representation of like everyone on stage is black. It was all about like inside what they [[01:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=6342.56s)]
*  listen to. I mean, Kendrick's a fucking legend, dude. Here's my take. Okay. [[01:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=6348.0s)]
*  It's fucking New Orleans. Like kind of like why not celebrate Boozy, [[01:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=6354.32s)]
*  Wayne, Master P. Like why not the way they did LA. Right. And it doesn't have to be black, you know. [[01:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=6361.92s)]
*  I mean, I'm sure there's Harry Connick Jr. sang at the beginning. There's a lot of talent that isn't, [[01:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=6368.0s)]
*  New Orleans is like a black music town, jazz, hip hop. I put Juve. [[01:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=6373.839999999999s)]
*  Oh, it would have been sick. But then somebody, I thought that too, somebody brought to my attention. [[01:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=6380.24s)]
*  But most of the people in New Orleans aren't at the game. Probably it's a lot of people from out [[01:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=6384.16s)]
*  of town. So then it's like, yeah, it's interesting. Do you celebrate the city? What is the real goal [[01:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=6388.32s)]
*  of whoever they put out there or why they put certain like stars? But then also, then I thought, [[01:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=6394.48s)]
*  well, also a lot of the athletes are black. They may all, Kendrick might be one of their [[01:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=6402.48s)]
*  favorites just because I don't, I haven't listened to a lot of Kendrick except for the mainstream [[01:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=6406.4s)]
*  stuff. Doesn't mean I don't, you know, that I wouldn't like it. I don't know. I guess I probably [[01:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=6409.919999999999s)]
*  wanted something more that a basic white guy would want, you know, Jelly Roll, Bruno Mars. [[01:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=6414.48s)]
*  Bruno Mars is, there's no one, there's no performer better than Bruno Mars. His shows, [[01:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=6420.48s)]
*  top to goddamn bottom are the most entertaining shows with so many songs you recognize. [[01:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=6427.68s)]
*  Yeah. It is, that guy is so talented. Justin Timberlake, I'm worth my money. New kids on the [[01:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=6434.32s)]
*  block. Bring them back. I would be a cool Super Bowl show. Maybe if they'd have done like some [[01:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=6440.72s)]
*  music over the years. But I think sometimes you just, you don't, you forget that just because you [[01:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=6444.96s)]
*  do, like if, if it wasn't me tweeting, nobody would probably share it or give it a fuck. Yeah. And I [[01:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=6450.4s)]
*  don't mean that in a way, like an ego way, like, but sometimes you're just tweeting shit, just [[01:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=6456.4s)]
*  thinking like, this is what I think nobody's going to care. I said, I said out loud, it should have [[01:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=6459.92s)]
*  been Lil Wayne and Juby and everyone. And then we were at, we were doing, I did a show at the Super [[01:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=6464.799999999999s)]
*  Bowl with Nikki, Tony and Shane. And, and I didn't even, I didn't even see my critique come back at [[01:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=6469.2s)]
*  me. But someone goes, why didn't you have Theo and Mark here? And I was like, huh? And they're like, [[01:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=6476.08s)]
*  this is their hometown. They should have performed here. And I went, oh fuck. I was like, I didn't [[01:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=6480.879999999999s)]
*  even think I didn't even, you guys asked me to come do it. I think we did. Yeah. I just couldn't, [[01:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=6485.12s)]
*  yeah. I couldn't go home for the Super Bowl. Cause I was, had to do that movie. God damn it. That's [[01:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=6489.28s)]
*  right. I did. I wanted to ask Mormon too. Yeah. That guy. Yeah. Fuck that guy. You know, I mean, [[01:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=6493.36s)]
*  it's always something that's going to make you feel some type of way, I guess. And then it's like, [[01:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=6498.4s)]
*  I don't know. I mean, but then I was like, why do I fucking care? Like, and who needs to hear my [[01:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=6502.48s)]
*  opinion? So I'm going to interrupt you. Cause here's what I'd love to know. Did you get any push [[01:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=6507.5199999999995s)]
*  back when you went to the Republican national or the Republican inauguration? Yeah. For real. [[01:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=6513.04s)]
*  Yeah. I did get pushed back about it, which I didn't really understand. Like I would go, [[01:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=6519.76s)]
*  if anybody invited me to go to the inauguration, dude, like people on the street where I grew up, [[01:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=6524.72s)]
*  they're not, nobody's ever going to the inauguration. Nobody from my fucking street, [[01:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=6529.2s)]
*  my neighborhood is ever going to the inauguration. Probably ever. They're not, some of these people [[01:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=6533.68s)]
*  cannot legally vote anymore. So the simple fact that I got to go, right? Bobby Kennedy is a friend [[01:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=6539.52s)]
*  of mine. Bobby Kennedy is a sweet dude. People are like, you're not, I'm going to support my fucking [[01:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=6546.8s)]
*  friend. I don't care if they're, if I have a friend that went to jail for even something serious, [[01:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=6550.8s)]
*  I would still go and, you know, maybe speak on their behalf sometimes or take them bread or [[01:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=6555.360000000001s)]
*  whatever, you know, like I'm going to be supportive. So yeah, some of that shit, but I would never hold [[01:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=6560.56s)]
*  it against somebody if they went to an inauguration. So then I got to start thinking, [[01:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=6566.4s)]
*  well, that's just odd of that person. Some of that's on them, you know, like I've even had [[01:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=6571.36s)]
*  friends that I've texted and they'll be like, Oh, it's, uh, didn't know you were so MAGA or whatever. [[01:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=6575.12s)]
*  And it was like, I've never ever in my life thought of myself as MAGA, you know, I've never thought [[01:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=6580.32s)]
*  of you as, I've never thought of you as political. I've thought of you as just a person interested [[01:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=6585.2s)]
*  in living life. Like that's, I mean, that's my perspective. Like I didn't, I honestly, I, [[01:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=6589.44s)]
*  when you went to the inauguration, I was like, Oh, that's fucking dope. That's fucking crazy. [[01:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=6594.400000000001s)]
*  Like I would go in a heart, I'd go in a fucking heartbeat. I went to, I went to George Bush's, [[01:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=6598.320000000001s)]
*  when I was a kid, I went to George Bush's, uh, state of the union. I went to Bill Clinton's [[01:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=6602.400000000001s)]
*  state of the union and George Bush's state of the union. No one ever called me on it. Like I was, [[01:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=6605.76s)]
*  I was 18, 20, whatever, 16, 18, whatever the fuck it is. I went to both. I went to the, uh, [[01:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=6610.0s)]
*  state of the union, like every time we got a president, my uncle could get me in. And I, [[01:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=6616.08s)]
*  and I just think it's a crazy wild thing to see democracy working. And like I, [[01:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=6620.16s)]
*  if I got invited to an inauguration or, I mean, I got invited to the, uh, Republican national [[01:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=6626.32s)]
*  convention, but it was as an influencer and I was like, I'm not going to, yeah, I wouldn't, [[01:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=6632.32s)]
*  I think I got invited as that too. I wouldn't go to, I wouldn't do something like that. I'm [[01:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=6635.76s)]
*  not going to go like, go like, I'm going to get you fans, but like, if you invite me and I don't [[01:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=6638.8s)]
*  have to do shit and I can hang out, I fucking go, I thought it was cool shit. Yeah. I wouldn't go to [[01:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=6642.5599999999995s)]
*  support like one party. You know what I'm saying? Like if somebody, like I got asked to do some [[01:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=6647.36s)]
*  Republican stuff like that, I wouldn't go do that, you know? Um, and we just got lucky with that too. [[01:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=6651.759999999999s)]
*  We come on our podcast was, uh, Vance and Trump, everybody got asked, everybody was in, everybody [[01:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=6657.839999999999s)]
*  was emailing with us, but they didn't want to come. Like there's nothing I can do about that. And then [[01:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=6663.759999999999s)]
*  you expect that I'm not going to go kind of be supportive of the fact that they even came in. [[01:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=6668.16s)]
*  They came. Yeah. Fuck. At least they fucking gave a fuck to come. Do you know, I think Trump, [[01:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=6672.5599999999995s)]
*  what they're doing with Gaza and him coming in and speaking on that is one of the most fucked up [[01:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=6677.76s)]
*  things I've ever heard of in my life. Kind of, you know, that's how little I know about politics. [[01:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=6682.08s)]
*  But so it's like, yeah, I don't know. That shit was kind of crazy to me, but then you got to realize [[01:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=6686.08s)]
*  like all you could, like, I just have to just be myself, man. I don't even know who that is sometimes. [[01:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=6690.0s)]
*  And so I'm still learning about who that is. You know, well, you should, I mean, this is why I'm [[01:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=6696.48s)]
*  saying this to hear it, right? Yeah. I'm saying this to hear it, but what you have to realize is [[01:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=6700.88s)]
*  that the people that love you love you and then fuck everyone else. That's the truth is I'm trying [[01:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=6705.36s)]
*  to get to that. The people that love you love you and fuck everyone else because you can't fucking [[01:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=6710.08s)]
*  help someone that doesn't like you. That person that sends that text has been waiting to send [[01:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=6714.799999999999s)]
*  that text in one manner or another. They're bothered by everything good happening in your life. [[01:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=6720.0s)]
*  It's a reflection of their shortcomings. And they're like, didn't know you were so mega. And [[01:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=6725.36s)]
*  you're like, go fuck yourself. Go fuck yourself. Yeah. If you ever think you could, I would never [[01:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=6729.04s)]
*  let anybody even put a pin in me that's described me as one part of one group anyway. I will never [[01:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=6734.48s)]
*  be part of one group. I wouldn't even do that to myself. This is who I am. I'm vegan. They don't [[01:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=6741.36s)]
*  even have the fucking group that I am, you know? And hey buddy, they do not have the group you are. [[01:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=6747.36s)]
*  And I think they don't have the group that a lot of us are. They don't have more complex than just [[01:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=6752.08s)]
*  being like you're this or that, you know? Yeah. If they said we had a fucking 30 K struggling [[01:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=6756.0s)]
*  alcoholic guy who's in therapy with his wife, you know what I'm saying? Who loves a fucking good [[01:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=6762.88s)]
*  brisket and Johnson brought, you know what I'm saying? And cares about his kids a ton. [[01:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=6767.68s)]
*  Where's that group? My group doesn't exist. My group, I love when they want to put me in my group [[01:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=6773.28s)]
*  and go, Hey man, uh, uh, you have a problem with your drinking. And I go, I'm doing pretty good. [[01:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=6777.36s)]
*  That is a good point, dude. Anybody that says you have a problem, you're doing pretty good. [[01:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=6784.4800000000005s)]
*  There's always guys in the system or whatever it's called. And they're like, Hey man, you know, [[01:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=6788.32s)]
*  you have a drinking problem. I go, okay. I had a guy tell me, I won't say his name, but I'll tell [[01:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=6791.44s)]
*  you after he goes, just cause you think you have to make a ton of money and you're on an arena tour [[01:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=6794.32s)]
*  and you have three successful podcasts and you're happily married and your kids are good. You think [[01:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=6798.639999999999s)]
*  that that didn't mean you have a problem. I went, no, I think that's exactly what that means. I think [[01:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=6802.96s)]
*  that means that like I got fucking feelers around me and if something goes sideways, they tell me, [[01:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=6806.48s)]
*  but like right now we're doing pretty solid. So like I go, I, I said it on a podcast a long time [[01:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=6810.5599999999995s)]
*  ago and I got a lot of heat from people in the system and they were like, uh, I said, I said, [[01:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=6816.16s)]
*  sometimes I think the problem is the person and it's not the booze or the alcohol. It's going to [[01:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=6821.12s)]
*  show its head up in another place. You get rid of the booze and it shows itself up in gambling or [[01:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=6824.48s)]
*  jerking off or sex addiction. It's like, you got to take care of the problem. If you don't have the [[01:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=6828.639999999999s)]
*  problem, like if you don't have the problem, then maybe the, maybe the, maybe you should look at [[01:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=6832.32s)]
*  that. Like go like him and like my wife was a big drinker in high college and quit drinking thinking [[01:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=6837.36s)]
*  she was an alcoholic and then realized, oh no, I, my parents were split up. I had a shitty [[01:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=6844.48s)]
*  childhood. I need to get in therapy and fix all the things that when I drink, the bring those to [[01:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=6848.4s)]

*  I don't want to be too bloated when I see Theo tomorrow. So I was like, I'm gonna go to sleep, [[01:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlJKkQxY-_c&t=6866.32s)]
