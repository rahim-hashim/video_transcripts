**Theo Von - This Past Weekend:** [March 28, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8)
*  In light of the tragedy today in Nashville, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=0.0s)]
*  but just wanna say that, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4.04s)]
*  you know, my heart is really just broken, [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7.68s)]
*  as I think a lot of people's are. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=12.4s)]
*  You know, this happened just right down the street from me. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=15.120000000000001s)]
*  And it's, [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=17.64s)]
*  it's just heavy, man. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=21.34s)]
*  It's a lot. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=22.240000000000002s)]
*  And we just wanna, [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=24.12s)]
*  we just wanna say that we are thinking of those people [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=26.4s)]
*  who are suffering and praying for peace. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=34.16s)]
*  And just praying that comfort finds them. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=40.92s)]
*  And I know people have different thoughts on prayers [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=46.519999999999996s)]
*  and stuff, that's fine. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=48.480000000000004s)]
*  I'm not trying to solve the problem today. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=49.96s)]
*  I'm just trying to take some moments to, [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=53.24s)]
*  out of my own life, to think of other people, I guess. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=57.080000000000005s)]
*  But yeah, just wanted to say that that's on our minds [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=61.64s)]
*  and hearts over here. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=65.32000000000001s)]
*  And it's just a heavy, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=66.72s)]
*  it is, it has been a, [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=69.12s)]
*  it's been just a heavy time and it's a fresh, heavy thing. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=71.08s)]
*  And that's what's going on. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=74.68s)]
*  And we're grateful to be alive today [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=78.36s)]
*  and to be able to have a podcast [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=81.68s)]
*  and to sit and talk with people that we care about [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=84.08000000000001s)]
*  and that you are alive today to listen. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=87.76s)]
*  So thank you and we love you guys. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=92.36000000000001s)]
*  I wanna let you know for touring [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=97.56s)]
*  that we will be adding dates eventually for Australia [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=98.80000000000001s)]
*  and Europe, the UK, everywhere. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=102.74000000000001s)]
*  We're adding places as much as we can [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=107.84s)]
*  and trying to stay sane and well at the same time. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=110.84s)]
*  So looking forward to getting over there. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=115.36s)]
*  Just had a great week in Houston in Corpus Christi. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=117.84s)]
*  And yeah, just wanna let you guys know that. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=120.92s)]
*  There are still a few tickets available [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=124.5s)]
*  for Medford, Massachusetts, New York, New York, [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=126.44s)]
*  Las Vegas, Uncasville, Connecticut, and Toronto, Ontario. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=132.16s)]
*  All those are available at theovon.com slash T-O-U-R. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=138.16s)]
*  And if some of the tickets get outrageous, [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=144.84s)]
*  they won't be outrageously priced through us, [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=147.04s)]
*  but if through resellers they get outrageously priced, [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=148.92s)]
*  then just hold off, we'll come back through. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=152.68s)]
*  So I don't want you guys spending a ton of money. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=155.01999999999998s)]
*  Thank you very much for the support. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=160.74s)]

*  How much water do you guys have each in a day? [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=224.95999999999998s)]
*  I'm trying to have a lot more. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=228.0s)]
*  I'm trying to have a gallon. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=230.68s)]
*  That's one of the biggest things to do, is have water. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=233.35999999999999s)]
*  One of the best things you could ever do. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=237.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=240.07999999999998s)]
*  Is the most, it's seeing how much people are dehydrated. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=240.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=244.79999999999998s)]
*  You don't even know it, but it's like, [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=245.79999999999998s)]
*  you should have that lemon water in the morning. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=247.07999999999998s)]
*  First thing, you take a lemon, [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=249.2s)]
*  just put it in water and then neutral it [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=250.51999999999998s)]
*  and then just grind it up and then chug it. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=253.16s)]
*  Refreshes all your electrolytes first thing. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=254.28s)]
*  Are you serious? [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=256.04s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=256.88s)]
*  Oh wow, how much, a whole lemon in there? [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=257.72s)]
*  Just a whole lemon, just cut a peel it [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=259.08s)]
*  and put it in with water and then just chug it. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=260.6s)]
*  So you take the peel off. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=263.36s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=264.40000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, people are dehydrated. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=266.84000000000003s)]
*  Science says we should have a ton of water. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=268.88s)]
*  Yeah, people are very dehydrated. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=270.8s)]
*  You think they are? [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=273.12s)]
*  I think so, I think most, I think, [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=274.0s)]
*  I mean the percentage has gotta be 85%. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=275.68s)]
*  Are you dehydrated or not? [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=279.52s)]
*  Dehydrated. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=280.8s)]
*  I don't know, but it could be that high. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=282.32s)]
*  But it's one of those things too, [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=284.12s)]
*  where it's like, you don't realize it, [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=285.16s)]
*  you're that dehydrated, but it's also one of those things [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=287.08s)]
*  where it's like, you're not breathing right. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=291.64s)]
*  Yes. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=293.88s)]
*  It's one of those things either. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=294.72s)]
*  It's like, you're just a shallow breather. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=295.56s)]
*  Right. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=297.76s)]
*  Yeah, maybe you're just like burning off all the water [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=298.6s)]
*  because you don't breathe, [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=301.04s)]
*  you're not getting like the right depth of air or something. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=301.88s)]
*  Yeah, I mean they're not relayed, [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=304.12s)]
*  but it's like one of those things you just take for granted. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=305.88s)]
*  It's like, yeah, I'm getting enough water from Thursday, [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=307.32s)]
*  I drink it, that's how I know I'm dehydrated. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=309.0s)]
*  It's the same thing, it's like, [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=312.35999999999996s)]
*  yeah, there's no problem with my breathing. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=313.2s)]
*  He's like, no, no, no, you need to be doing [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=314.03999999999996s)]
*  these deep breaths all the time. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=314.88s)]
*  He does deep breathing. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=316.84s)]
*  You do. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=318.15999999999997s)]
*  He's a big have, I mean, he does, we're talking. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=319.0s)]
*  I feel like you would like talking to him [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=321.96s)]
*  about getting some, the structure this guy has. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=323.4s)]
*  That habitualness? [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=327.35999999999996s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=328.44s)]
*  Yeah, I'm trying to think of how much water that I have [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=331.32s)]
*  or how much I like having. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=333.32s)]
*  I think I like having it. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=335.76s)]
*  I think, yeah, science says that you are supposed to have [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=337.28s)]
*  like a pretty much, I don't know if a gallon, [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=343.47999999999996s)]

*  I'm telling you, I'm Italian, I made that up. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=461.48s)]
*  Our water's more educated than your water is. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=464.52s)]

*  And they're not, people are sleeping on the job. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=478.88s)]
*  Some of the stuff's getting through. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=483.52s)]
*  I mean, it's funny. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=485.24s)]
*  You see like a float go through, you see some trash. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=486.08s)]
*  You see some stuff that you know, [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=488.88s)]
*  I remember seeing people laugh about the fact [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=491.4s)]
*  that somebody was gonna try to drink that. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=493.52s)]
*  You don't see, I just picture you have like a paddle [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=495.44s)]
*  and you're supposed to grab that trash [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=498.44s)]
*  and you just go, that's too far, [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=500.0s)]
*  and you let it go through, [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=501.32s)]
*  and it's going out of someone's sink. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=502.64s)]
*  Someone's sink just flows and they're like, [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=504.68s)]
*  my water's not going. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=506.76s)]

*  That's what. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=511.16s)]
*  Yeah, man, they had a lot of, I remember, [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=512.84s)]
*  in the last tank, like the stuff that's supposed to go out, [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=516.12s)]
*  like it's supposed to be pure or whatever, [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=518.76s)]
*  I remember finding a bunch of barrettes in there [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=520.04s)]
*  and being like, oh God. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=522.04s)]
*  We're not doing our job. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=524.04s)]
*  Barrettes, like hair barrettes for children, [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=525.32s)]
*  or adults, I guess. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=527.52s)]
*  Why would people be throwing those away? [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=529.72s)]
*  I read water meters. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=531.72s)]

*  Like you'll just stay in the shower for a long time? [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=576.76s)]
*  I could take long showers. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=578.24s)]
*  If I brush my teeth and I go pee, [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=580.64s)]
*  I can leave the water running and I'll go pee [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=582.2s)]
*  and then come back. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=584.2s)]
*  And what's your mindset there? [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=585.04s)]
*  It's just like, why interrupt the flow of it? [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=585.86s)]

*  Dude, I was like that. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=602.72s)]
*  I remember whenever they first came up with electric cars, [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=603.5600000000001s)]
*  I remember driving down the road and just, [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=605.8000000000001s)]
*  I had a gas, I was just pouring gas, [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=608.32s)]
*  driving a gas powered car and pouring gas out of my window. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=610.36s)]
*  Like out of a gas tank, just like, fuck it. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=613.5600000000001s)]
*  We're not gonna lose. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=615.88s)]
*  You're not gonna lose. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=616.88s)]
*  I had. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=618.0s)]
*  And we lost. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=618.84s)]
*  We lost. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=619.6600000000001s)]
*  We lost. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=620.5s)]
*  It was very expensive for you to go drive around. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=621.34s)]
*  You had to double fill up. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=624.76s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=626.4s)]
*  We had, I had gas. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=627.9599999999999s)]
*  I delivered mattresses and appliances here in Nashville [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=629.9599999999999s)]
*  growing up. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=635.88s)]
*  And, or when I was 18, 19, 20. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=636.8s)]
*  And so we had a 26 foot box truck that we did. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=639.8s)]
*  And it got the gas tank, the fuel tank, [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=644.4s)]
*  cause you put diesel in it, broke. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=649.12s)]
*  And we're driving down 24 of the interstate here. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=651.88s)]
*  And we didn't realize it, [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=654.68s)]
*  but it was leaking fuel the whole way. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=657.08s)]
*  So, I mean, from one, from we get off, we fill it up [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=659.6800000000001s)]
*  and it got punctured somehow, I forget how. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=663.36s)]
*  And then it leaks the whole way. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=666.12s)]
*  And then we get off. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=668.04s)]
*  And I mean, there's just a trail of diesel. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=668.88s)]
*  And so you'd have to go, when we were driving, [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=671.32s)]
*  you'd have to, especially to another place, [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=673.48s)]
*  you'd have to go to weigh stations, [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=675.8s)]
*  you know, that weigh your truck. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=679.16s)]
*  And then someone came up and we, [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=682.32s)]
*  how we fixed it was just putting duct tape [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=684.7199999999999s)]
*  and spray painted it black over it. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=686.4399999999999s)]
*  And so this lady came and she was like an official, [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=688.64s)]
*  an officer that's like checking our truck. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=692.88s)]
*  And I mean, it was like- [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=694.9599999999999s)]
*  DOT, Department of Transportation? [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=695.8s)]
*  Yes, yes. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=696.8s)]
*  That sounds pretty thorough. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=698.0799999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=699.4399999999999s)]
*  To put black duct tape over it and paint it. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=700.28s)]
*  Well, so we're driving- [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=702.4s)]
*  It's very Italian kind of. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=703.9599999999999s)]
*  So me and my buddy are driving. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=704.92s)]
*  And where he and Jamie, Jamie's driving. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=706.7199999999999s)]
*  And Jamie does not have a, [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=711.56s)]
*  I don't think he has a license. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=715.1999999999999s)]
*  And like he's has a lot of criminal stuff. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=717.04s)]
*  So he's driving. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=719.72s)]
*  So he's like, oh, you need to get in the driver's seat [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=721.36s)]
*  because we're about to have to go through this weigh station. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=723.76s)]
*  So in the middle of the interstate, [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=726.36s)]
*  I have to stand up and we switched places. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=727.72s)]
*  Now I'm driving. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=730.24s)]
*  We pull in and then she's like, [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=731.48s)]
*  I'm gonna come check your truck. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=733.52s)]
*  And I'm like, dude, [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=734.84s)]
*  she sees that we are fuel tankers, just duct tape. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=735.68s)]
*  We're gonna go, I don't know, [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=740.92s)]
*  you might go to jail. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=741.96s)]
*  I don't know what's gonna happen. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=742.8s)]
*  So then I'm like out, [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=743.92s)]
*  like I meet her halfway out [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=745.72s)]
*  and I'm just trying to stand on like the step [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=747.4s)]
*  to try to hide the duct tape. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=749.44s)]
*  And we hit it. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=752.12s)]
*  We hit it. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=753.4s)]
*  She didn't see it? [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=754.24s)]
*  She didn't see it. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=755.08s)]
*  What a bad inspector. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=755.92s)]
*  Well- [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=756.76s)]
*  You see that that would probably be pretty obvious. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=757.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=759.2s)]
*  I don't think they expect anybody to be doing that. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=760.04s)]
*  I think they- [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=762.28s)]
*  Yeah, that's like low, that's like really Bush. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=763.12s)]
*  It's almost like that would have happened [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=765.6s)]
*  in like the early practice trial. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=767.32s)]
*  Like this is something nobody will ever do. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=769.52s)]
*  Yeah, they go, [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=771.1999999999999s)]
*  should I check to see the duct tape on the fuel tank? [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=772.36s)]
*  They're like, no, obviously not. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=774.36s)]
*  You know, it's like- [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=775.68s)]
*  These are adults. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=777.88s)]
*  It's like, yeah, it's like this is the 2000s now. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=778.72s)]
*  I think we're in the future. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=780.88s)]
*  So I think that stuff's long gone. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=781.88s)]
*  That's how they- [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=784.28s)]
*  Dude, I remember one time my brother, [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=785.88s)]
*  we grew up by this river [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=787.56s)]
*  and across from the river was the back of a rest area [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=791.0s)]
*  by the interstate. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=793.6s)]
*  And a lot of gay men and stuff would meet up over there [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=794.4399999999999s)]
*  and do drugs, or not drugs, not gay men, [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=796.96s)]
*  but they would do enough drugs where they would be gay. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=799.5600000000001s)]
*  Yeah, like drug induced gay. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=802.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=805.1600000000001s)]
*  And one time anyway, somebody draw a big wiener [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=806.0s)]
*  on my brother's back, right? [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=811.32s)]
*  And we got back to the house [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=813.0400000000001s)]
*  and we were just trying to hide it, [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=814.6s)]
*  like hide the back of my brother from my mom. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=817.84s)]
*  It just reminded me of that, dude. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=820.48s)]
*  And then when she saw it finally, [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=821.96s)]
*  she got so fucking pissed, man. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=823.2s)]
*  We told her that someone else did it. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=825.32s)]
*  You let someone do that? [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=826.6s)]
*  I didn't, I mean, I couldn't help it. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=828.0s)]
*  They were adults. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=829.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=830.36s)]
*  These were adults doing it. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=831.1999999999999s)]
*  They actually drew it on his back? [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=832.24s)]
*  Yeah, drew like a wiener or penis. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=834.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=838.4399999999999s)]
*  But one time we rented a car [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=839.28s)]
*  and they got a dent in it and we caught a pigeon [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=842.68s)]
*  and made it shit over the dent to kind of cover it up [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=846.12s)]
*  before we turned it in. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=849.4399999999999s)]
*  You gotta just hold it and just- [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=850.8399999999999s)]
*  I mean, you gotta squeeze a little. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=852.4s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, to get it out. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=854.8s)]
*  They didn't even catch the pigeon and grab it. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=856.4s)]
*  I've never held a pigeon before. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=858.5999999999999s)]
*  Well, if you have to, you have to. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=860.0s)]
*  We're just trying to avoid that fine. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=860.8399999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=862.24s)]
*  But- [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=863.0799999999999s)]
*  I would think anybody that could catch a pigeon, [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=863.92s)]
*  it would be you, Theo. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=865.68s)]
*  I think they don't even notice I'm there at first. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=868.0s)]
*  Yeah, I think they go, you're one of us. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=870.04s)]
*  They go, what's up, man? [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=871.76s)]
*  You go, hey. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=873.9599999999999s)]
*  When you were squeezing it, did you go, [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=875.04s)]
*  I hope you had a big lunch. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=876.76s)]
*  Because what? [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=878.56s)]
*  Pigeons have to go to the bathroom a lot. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=879.4s)]
*  Yeah, they're ready to go. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=881.1999999999999s)]
*  You don't have to do much. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=882.64s)]
*  You could almost even whisper to them, just do it. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=883.48s)]
*  And the pigeons down here are probably healthier [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=885.8000000000001s)]

*  I love watching the tape an hour, yeah. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=1049.4s)]
*  It's so good. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=1050.88s)]
*  And it'll be on my YouTube on March 24th, [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=1052.92s)]
*  but it's so good. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=1055.48s)]
*  And it's like, you're seeing this, [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=1057.0400000000002s)]
*  we talked a lot about this last night, [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=1059.28s)]
*  like the way it's all kind of going now with specials [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=1060.6399999999999s)]
*  or you're like doing stuff like that. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=1063.72s)]
*  And I'm clean in comics. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=1065.96s)]
*  So like this special mic is gonna be clean. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=1070.12s)]
*  Like, cause it's like, just kind of my world is like, [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=1072.12s)]
*  kind of that. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=1075.68s)]
*  But it's like for clean comics, [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=1076.52s)]
*  they don't get the level of comic the mic is. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=1078.68s)]
*  Like usually like clean is, [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=1082.0s)]
*  it's basically just being like TV clean. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=1084.72s)]
*  We had to did Comedy Central stuff. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=1086.56s)]
*  You did a half hour, you did all this. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=1088.24s)]
*  You had to be TV clean back when you did that stuff. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=1089.72s)]
*  So it's kind of making stuff like that. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=1092.08s)]
*  But putting specials out, [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=1094.92s)]
*  cause we got his coming out, [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=1096.16s)]
*  then Greg Warren and then Joe Zimmerman is, [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=1097.52s)]
*  we taped, I taped three hours. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=1099.68s)]
*  And so it's just being super fun and super funny. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=1101.8s)]
*  It's what I think you do well as, [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=1104.84s)]
*  where it's your super fun. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=1107.04s)]

*  you know, afterwards you go and you're with all of them. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=1118.9599999999998s)]

*  And the love they have for you is something that's, [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=1124.52s)]
*  I is it's getting lost in entertainment. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=1127.12s)]
*  And it's being, there's such a disconnect with some, [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=1130.4399999999998s)]
*  with a lot of things where people like, [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=1133.3999999999999s)]
*  they're not just, they, I don't know, they don't have, [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=1136.36s)]

*  and all this stuff. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=1142.4799999999998s)]
*  You're like, show them the respect to give them a good show [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=1143.32s)]
*  and be just entertaining and be fun. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=1145.84s)]
*  Be a break for everybody. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=1148.24s)]
*  No one needs this, everything doesn't need to be [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=1149.9199999999998s)]
*  this super heavy kind of thing or this, [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=1152.0s)]
*  I'm smarter than you, I know this and I know, you know, [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=1154.6399999999999s)]

*  Yes. Right. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=1190.08s)]

*  dressed me completely. [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=1528.1599999999999s)]

*  Yeah, I go very basic colors. [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=1538.12s)]

*  Because the last time they saw you was a nightmare. [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=1559.64s)]
*  It was a nightmare. [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=1562.8000000000002s)]
*  So you're reintroducing to your family. [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=1564.28s)]
*  Your mom lays it out. [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=1566.04s)]
*  You're seeing your grandmother again. [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=1566.96s)]

*  Like it was like, this one is, you're gonna go back. [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=1576.64s)]

*  I don't have to think about, [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=1592.2800000000002s)]
*  I understand why people wear the same thing every day. [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=1593.8000000000002s)]
*  It's like you don't have to think about it. [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=1596.0800000000002s)]
*  You just put it on, put it on, put it on. [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=1597.44s)]
*  I think about that all the time. [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=1599.92s)]
*  I love that. [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=1601.1200000000001s)]
*  I wear the same thing every day. [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=1602.0s)]
*  Yeah, I tell you, on stage I wear the same thing [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=1603.92s)]
*  for the past two years maybe, or three, [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=1606.2s)]
*  maybe three, four years almost now. [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=1608.16s)]
*  It's just the easiest, yeah. [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=1610.68s)]
*  Black shirt and black pants is the same exact ones. [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=1612.04s)]
*  It's just easy for me. [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=1615.1200000000001s)]
*  I can't, if I get too much opportunities [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=1616.44s)]
*  to think about stuff, I don't do well. [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=1618.64s)]
*  Yeah, I agree. [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=1620.48s)]
*  I don't, but I think about it. [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=1622.8s)]
*  I think about it just in regular life. [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=1625.76s)]
*  Like just, you're like just buy this same stuff, [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=1627.2s)]
*  wear it everywhere, and then that's it. [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=1631.32s)]
*  It's a lot of decisions. [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=1634.8s)]
*  You need to get decisions out of your life. [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=1636.68s)]
*  And one color too. [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=1638.52s)]
*  I think that's one thing that the black culture does well. [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=1639.56s)]
*  They do, they'll be like one color. [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=1641.8799999999999s)]
*  Like today Larry is fuchsia. [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=1644.72s)]
*  Yeah, right. [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=1647.8s)]
*  And it's topped the bottom. [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=1648.6399999999999s)]
*  It's topped the bottom, yeah. [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=1649.72s)]
*  And he goes full fuchsia. [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=1650.56s)]
*  Like he will fucking fight for the fucking fusion military. [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=1651.3999999999999s)]
*  He will, there is no, he's eating Asian fusion for lunch. [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=1654.44s)]
*  There's no, like he is full fuchsia for that day. [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=1658.76s)]
*  You couldn't fucking, if you came near him [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=1662.24s)]
*  with a little bit of fucking lavender [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=1664.3600000000001s)]
*  or a little bit of fucking tangerine, [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=1666.76s)]
*  he might fucking, he'll flex on you. [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=1668.76s)]
*  That is true. [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=1671.32s)]
*  But they've mastered the art of that. [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=1672.88s)]
*  Let's make, kind of let's keep it simple. [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=1674.24s)]
*  You go with a good cologne, a fucking sturdy cologne, [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=1677.2s)]
*  and you go one color. [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=1680.48s)]
*  I've had you wear cologne? [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=1682.6000000000001s)]
*  I don't wear anymore. [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=1684.44s)]
*  I think cologne these days kind of signifies [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=1685.28s)]
*  that you're trying to hide something. [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=1688.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=1689.76s)]
*  You've obviously been, I think, [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=1690.6000000000001s)]
*  I think it's kind of two things. [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=1693.92s)]
*  Either you've never looked at pornography [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=1695.0800000000002s)]
*  or you've been cheating on your spouse. [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=1697.8000000000002s)]
*  A cologne is a good sign that you're cheating. [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=1700.92s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah, that is. [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=1703.0800000000002s)]
*  I think that's correct actually. [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=1704.16s)]
*  You wear cologne? [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=1705.44s)]
*  No, I wear Axe body spray. [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=1706.6000000000001s)]
*  Do you really still? [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=1708.24s)]
*  Which is I'm not ready to cheat, [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=1709.0800000000002s)]
*  but I still want to smell pungent. [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=1710.6000000000001s)]
*  I think pungent is a good, Nate, do you get pungent? [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=1712.8000000000002s)]
*  It's not good, I'd imagine. [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=1715.2s)]
*  It's an aggressive smell. [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=1717.28s)]
*  You spray Axe body spray? [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=1718.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=1719.84s)]
*  Do you really, Mike? [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=1720.68s)]
*  Yeah, at the gym. [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=1721.52s)]
*  Oh, God. [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=1722.36s)]
*  He's like a maniac. [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=1723.2s)]
*  So you have a family, you don't have a family, huh? [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=1724.04s)]
*  No. [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=1725.3999999999999s)]
*  I have a girlfriend and I have a family, [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=1726.24s)]
*  but not in the sense that traditional men have families, [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=1729.48s)]
*  like a wife and kids. [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=1733.84s)]
*  You have a mother and a brother and a sister, [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=1735.0s)]
*  but I have a girlfriend. [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=1736.96s)]
*  So you have an original family, [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=1738.48s)]
*  but you don't have your own family. [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=1739.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=1740.28s)]
*  Oh, that's a good way to put it. [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=1741.12s)]
*  Original. [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=1741.96s)]
*  Yeah, original family. [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=1742.8s)]
*  That'd be my original family. [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=1743.6399999999999s)]
*  Yeah, he's very, he's very put together. [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=1744.6399999999999s)]
*  He wrestled at Penn State. [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=1748.04s)]
*  Oh, you did? [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=1749.4399999999998s)]
*  I wrestled for one year. [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=1750.28s)]
*  I wrestled for one year. [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=1751.6799999999998s)]
*  So I went through the training and everything [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=1752.6s)]
*  and the second year I was like, I can't do this. [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=1755.36s)]
*  This is so much work. [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=1758.52s)]
*  This was the, it was so much work. [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=1759.7199999999998s)]
*  This was the 60s, go ahead. [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=1761.36s)]
*  What was the story about? [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=1763.28s)]
*  Well, when Lyndon Johnson got into office. [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=1764.84s)]
*  This is where black people were allowed to wrestle. [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=1766.32s)]
*  Go ahead, Mike. [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=1767.6799999999998s)]
*  Oh yeah, you only had to wrestle whites, that's easy. [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=1768.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=1769.9199999999998s)]
*  We all made the Penn State team, I guess. [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=1771.48s)]
*  But yeah, after the first year, I was like, this is, [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=1775.08s)]
*  I mean, the guys were so good. [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=1777.4399999999998s)]
*  It was so, the training was so tough. [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=1778.9599999999998s)]
*  Sometimes we'd have to work out three times a day. [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=1780.36s)]
*  And it was just, I'm like, I can't wrap my head around it. [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=1782.9599999999998s)]
*  So I didn't do it. [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=1787.6s)]
*  And then I really enjoyed the rest of my college career [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=1789.24s)]
*  because I was friends with a lot of those guys [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=1791.6399999999999s)]
*  and I lived with them. [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=1793.1599999999999s)]
*  And so I had a great time just not having to do [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=1794.0s)]
*  the punishing, punishing. [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=1796.84s)]
*  I still love the sport. [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=1798.24s)]
*  But to be honest, like I didn't, [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=1799.84s)]
*  I wasn't good enough to be there really. [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=1801.56s)]
*  I placed in states in high school where I was from. [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=1805.44s)]
*  I thought I was good for my area, which is Florida, [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=1808.48s)]
*  which was what wasn't, I started wrestling in Ohio [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=1810.48s)]
*  and then placed in states in Florida [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=1812.92s)]
*  where I went to high school. [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=1814.36s)]
*  And so I was good for my area, [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=1815.72s)]
*  but we were number three in the country [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=1817.12s)]
*  the year that I wrestled there. [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=1820.76s)]
*  And we had just all Americans and national champs [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=1822.4s)]
*  all up and down the lineup. [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=1825.48s)]
*  So it was just, going to practice [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=1826.84s)]
*  was just taking beatings every day. [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=1829.04s)]
*  But you know, I learned a lot, mental toughness, [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=1831.24s)]
*  all that stuff. [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=1833.12s)]
*  So it was great. [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=1833.9199999999998s)]
*  It was a great experience. [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=1834.76s)]
*  You think you could beat, [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=1835.6799999999998s)]
*  like Bobby Lee says that he wrestled in, [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=1836.52s)]
*  I don't know what he was in, [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=1840.36s)]
*  an internment camp or something. [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=1841.32s)]
*  But he said that he wrestled at some point. [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=1842.96s)]
*  He had to wrestle. [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=1845.24s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=1846.36s)]
*  He had no choice. [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=1847.1999999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=1848.04s)]
*  He probably wrestled for oranges [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=1849.12s)]
*  or whatever they had for dinner. [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=1851.3999999999999s)]
*  But do you think you could bring up Bobby Lee [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=1853.1599999999999s)]
*  in a wrestling, there you go. [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=1855.72s)]
*  That's great. [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=1857.1999999999998s)]
*  You think you could beat him in a wrestling. [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=1858.04s)]
*  I don't know his background. [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=1859.1999999999998s)]
*  Like I wasn't the best athlete in the world [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=1860.12s)]
*  and I also wasn't the best technician. [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=1862.16s)]
*  I worked, when I was on teams, [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=1865.0s)]
*  I would really work hard and I was like hard nosed. [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=1868.76s)]
*  So I can't say that about myself. [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=1871.44s)]
*  Yeah, that's how I describe his comedy. [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=1873.28s)]
*  Hard nosed. [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=1875.4s)]
*  Well, no, he's not the best at everything [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=1876.24s)]
*  but he does show up. [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=1877.68s)]
*  And that's how people come see you. [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=1879.0s)]
*  When people buy tickets, just know, [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=1881.76s)]
*  it's not going to be the best show you've ever seen [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=1884.1200000000001s)]
*  but Mike will show up. [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=1885.48s)]
*  I will, yeah. [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=1886.96s)]
*  He's like a union worker of comedy. [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=1887.8000000000002s)]
*  I'm blue collar. [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=1890.0800000000002s)]
*  I love that though. [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=1891.1200000000001s)]
*  So bring it back up, I want to see that picture. [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=1892.4s)]
*  You don't, be honest with me. [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=1894.0800000000002s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=1895.4s)]
*  Y'all are being different weight classes. [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=1896.24s)]
*  Yeah, we're different weight classes. [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=1897.28s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=1898.1200000000001s)]
*  Let's get a current picture of Bobby Lee then [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=1898.96s)]
*  and see if we could, there you go. [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=1900.3600000000001s)]
*  I could tell you, I could win by knowing his background. [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=1902.48s)]
*  What state did he wrestle in? [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=1906.76s)]
*  California. [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=1908.3200000000002s)]
*  California is a wild card state. [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=1909.16s)]
*  You could be really, there's like really good guys. [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=1912.16s)]
*  You wouldn't think California is a good state. [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=1914.4s)]
*  It's not good as Pennsylvania or Ohio or Iowa [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=1916.16s)]
*  but it is very good. [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=1918.5600000000002s)]
*  That's an actual picture of him during the tournament. [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=1920.4s)]
*  Yeah, so bring up that picture. [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=1922.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=1923.8400000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=1924.8000000000002s)]
*  Could you beat, and don't get it confused with his brother. [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=1925.64s)]
*  Just bring up a current picture of Bobby Lee. [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=1929.1200000000001s)]
*  Let's get real. [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=1931.64s)]
*  I just want to get to the truth here, Mike [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=1932.48s)]
*  because people are going to come see you. [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=1934.0400000000002s)]
*  They want to see the truth. [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=1936.1200000000001s)]
*  Yeah, they want to see you, exactly. [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=1937.1200000000001s)]
*  Can you beat this guy? [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=1938.6000000000001s)]
*  Zoom in on this man, please. [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=1939.52s)]
*  Can you beat this guy in wrestling? [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=1942.72s)]
*  Can I beat him in wrestling? [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=1945.64s)]
*  I'm just asking yourself honestly. [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=1946.92s)]
*  It's real easy to answer. [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=1948.3600000000001s)]
*  I think so. [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=1949.2s)]
*  I think so right now maybe. [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=1950.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=1952.36s)]
*  Because I'm in decent shape now. [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=1953.2s)]
*  Well you're in a shape. [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=1954.72s)]
*  I'm not in wrestling shape. [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=1955.56s)]
*  You're in a shape. [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=1956.3999999999999s)]
*  I'm in wrestling shape. [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=1957.24s)]
*  This guy's pockets definitely is more of a tapas, I think. [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=1958.96s)]
*  The other guy we did, Greg Warren, [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=1964.6s)]
*  his special coming out today, he wrestled from Missouri. [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=1967.12s)]
*  From New York. [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=1969.68s)]
*  He was all American. [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=1970.52s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=1971.36s)]
*  Nate is doing nothing but wrestlers specials now. [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=1972.18s)]
*  Well they just had the national championship [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=1974.08s)]
*  on this weekend I think. [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=1975.32s)]
*  And Penn State is unreal now. [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=1976.1599999999999s)]
*  Joe Zimmerman, college golfer. [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=1977.76s)]
*  Oh he was? [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=1980.76s)]
*  For Davidson, yeah. [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=1981.6s)]
*  But Greg Warren wrestled with Michael Chandler's brother. [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=1982.44s)]
*  Oh really? [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=1987.52s)]
*  I think so. [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=1988.52s)]
*  Greg Warren, I say this on every podcast [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=1989.36s)]
*  because people in the comedy community is small. [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=1991.36s)]
*  They go, you wrestled, Greg wrestled. [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=1993.92s)]
*  Who would win, who would win? [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=1995.24s)]
*  I'm like, Greg was on another level. [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=1996.16s)]
*  He was an All-American. [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=1997.96s)]
*  He was that great. [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=1998.8s)]
*  He was really, really tough. [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=1999.64s)]
*  Did y'all come across that Foxcatcher guy? [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2000.48s)]
*  No, that guy was, that was happening when I was in school. [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2003.92s)]
*  But yeah, no, I saw that movie. [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2008.1200000000001s)]
*  That was crazy. [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2010.88s)]
*  He was out of his mind. [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2012.2s)]
*  That was when you were? [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2013.6000000000001s)]
*  That's when I was in college. [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2015.74s)]
*  Yeah, but those guys would go, [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2017.28s)]
*  like the guys, the top guys on the team [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2018.8s)]
*  would go train at Foxcatcher [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2020.4s)]
*  because for the Olympics and stuff. [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2022.2s)]
*  And was he doing touching people [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2024.16s)]
*  or he was abusing them? [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2025.76s)]
*  I haven't seen him do that. [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2026.76s)]
*  I don't know about that. [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2027.6000000000001s)]
*  Like I don't know the facts or everything, [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2028.6000000000001s)]
*  but I can't imagine. [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2029.88s)]
*  Oh you're on his side, go ahead. [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2031.0s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2032.28s)]
*  I can't imagine. [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2033.1200000000001s)]
*  I don't even know what the fuck [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2033.96s)]
*  that you're talking about. [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2035.0s)]
*  I can't imagine him doing that [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2035.84s)]
*  to this level of wrestlers, [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2036.9599999999998s)]
*  like touching them and being like [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2038.48s)]
*  not having any repercussions. [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2041.6799999999998s)]
*  Wrestlers are not stable people [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2043.52s)]
*  and they're not gonna play. [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2045.9199999999998s)]
*  I don't care how much money the guy has. [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2047.28s)]
*  So I can't see him being predatory [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2049.14s)]
*  against these types of guys. [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2053.56s)]
*  These types of guys are very, very tough guys. [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2055.2s)]
*  And I know the guy's a billionaire and all that stuff, [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2057.48s)]
*  but when somebody fondles you, [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2059.48s)]
*  all that goes out the window. [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2062.86s)]
*  Maybe not for you guys, I don't know. [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2063.92s)]
*  But for me. [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2066.6800000000003s)]
*  Yeah, you would put a stop to it. [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2067.5200000000004s)]
*  For me, you have to put a stop to it. [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2068.36s)]
*  But the level wrestler you're at, [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2069.2000000000003s)]
*  I don't think you could take him. [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2070.92s)]
*  I'm trying to think. [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2072.0800000000004s)]
*  Are we saying that though? [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2072.92s)]
*  Like would you have trouble with it? [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2074.5600000000004s)]
*  Would you right now just be saying [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2077.88s)]
*  well he was a different weight class [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2079.1200000000003s)]
*  so I had to go with it? [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2080.1200000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2081.6800000000003s)]
*  Yeah, what if he just does a naked, naked choke [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2082.94s)]
*  and you're like this, I don't think this is a hard one. [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2085.1000000000004s)]
*  Yeah, you're naked naked? [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2086.92s)]

*  And it's, we were talking about last night [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2112.24s)]
*  about where the specials are going, [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2114.9599999999996s)]

*  There's not, and we might, [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2118.04s)]
*  I'm gonna be doing something else too, [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2120.7999999999997s)]
*  that filming something with like newer, [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2123.3s)]
*  some newer comics, some not where it's like [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2126.26s)]
*  kind of a live at Gotham kind of thing. [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2127.78s)]
*  But it's, you know, comics, [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2130.1000000000004s)]
*  if you're starting now as a comic, [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2132.46s)]
*  what do you, it's like, what do you gotta do? [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2135.1400000000003s)]
*  Like for us, we were, we did live at Gotham. [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2137.28s)]
*  I think we did it all at the same time. [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2139.2200000000003s)]
*  Didn't we all do live at Gotham at the same time? [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2141.5800000000004s)]
*  I feel like you and I did it around the same, [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2142.42s)]
*  I strongly. [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2143.78s)]
*  Well, we did it. [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2144.98s)]
*  We did it the same year. [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2145.82s)]
*  I think we did it the same year, 2008. [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2146.6600000000003s)]
*  Like live at Gotham. [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2148.3s)]
*  And we did half hours in 2010, [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2149.1400000000003s)]
*  we did half hours the same year. [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2149.96s)]
*  Wow, in Boston, did y'all shoot yours? [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2151.38s)]
*  No, no, I shot mine in New York. [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2153.26s)]
*  So you were in Boston. [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2155.5s)]
*  Yeah, but we were all about the same time. [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2156.58s)]
*  And so like we, there was a path that comics had to take [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2159.6600000000003s)]
*  where we did live at Gotham, [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2163.1800000000003s)]
*  you did half hours, economy central hour. [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2165.1800000000003s)]
*  And then, you know, then Netflix came. [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2167.58s)]
*  But now for young comics, you're like, [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2169.34s)]
*  I don't know what you have to do. [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2171.5s)]
*  Like there's no, you can try to do a late night set, [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2172.82s)]
*  but outside of that, you're like, [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2178.36s)]
*  I mean, an hour Netflix, like, you know, there's not, [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2180.62s)]
*  I get Netflix did some 15 minute stuff, [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2183.7799999999997s)]
*  half hour stuff. [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2186.46s)]
*  Standup wise, there's nowhere to go. [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2187.2999999999997s)]
*  There used to be steps to measure yourself. [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2188.7799999999997s)]
*  Okay, I'm gonna shoot. [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2190.74s)]
*  I did my eight minutes on live at Gotham. [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2191.98s)]
*  Now I'm shooting for this half hour. [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2193.94s)]
*  It's like, I didn't get a half hour this year. [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2195.22s)]
*  It's like, all right, let me tighten it up [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2196.86s)]
*  and like try again next year. [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2198.7599999999998s)]
*  Like there was some ethics to like, [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2200.0s)]
*  you know, progressing. That's a good point. [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2202.42s)]
*  Now it's just like, let me try to get on TikTok [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2203.62s)]
*  and have a video go viral. [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2206.1s)]
*  And then do an hour. [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2207.18s)]
*  Like then their first step is an hour. [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2208.34s)]
*  And that's not the best. [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2211.26s)]
*  Like, yeah, that's a strange flex. [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2212.82s)]
*  A lot of people think that you think a lot of companies [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2214.98s)]
*  feel like they need to like do an hour now. [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2217.06s)]
*  No, no, I don't think, I mean, I think specials. [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2219.2200000000003s)]
*  The first thing they put out as an hour. [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2221.78s)]
*  The first thing they put out as an hour. [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2223.02s)]
*  And guys have been doing, like, you know, [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2224.38s)]
*  the thing with him and Greg and Joe is like, [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2226.38s)]
*  these are guys that have been doing comedy for 20 years. [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2229.58s)]
*  And so I've been doing it for 20 years too. [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2232.02s)]
*  Like, so it's like, we've been doing it for a long time. [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2233.7000000000003s)]
*  He's been doing it for a long time. [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2236.1800000000003s)]
*  So it's like, you're showing him to go do an hour. [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2237.1800000000003s)]
*  And you're like, yeah, dude, he can do, he can headline. [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2240.1800000000003s)]
*  He does an hour. [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2241.7000000000003s)]
*  But then there's comics that are newer. [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2242.7400000000002s)]
*  And it's like, I mean, their only outlet is to be like, [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2244.5s)]
*  well, I got clicks on TikTok or whatever. [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2246.82s)]
*  I'll put out an hour. [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2249.54s)]
*  And you're like, man, it's hard to build up to be able [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2250.5s)]
*  to do an hour, you know, headlining. [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2254.1000000000004s)]
*  Like, it's not an easy thing. [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2255.7400000000002s)]
*  Like it's, but guys are going from, [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2257.5800000000004s)]
*  they have a couple clips and it's, [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2260.78s)]
*  to then just putting out a full hour special. [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2262.78s)]
*  And I think the discipline of working in the clubs, [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2265.02s)]
*  the way that we all worked in the clubs is now, [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2268.02s)]
*  it's not totally out the window, but I don't think, [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2271.54s)]
*  we had no choice but to grind in the clubs [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2273.74s)]
*  for years and years. [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2276.54s)]
*  And that's not a thing anymore. [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2277.78s)]
*  It's not as big of a thing as it used to be. [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2280.5s)]
*  That's interesting. [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2282.5s)]
*  Because, you know, podcasts and TikTok and Instagram, [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2283.34s)]
*  it's like, oh, this is where I'm gonna have my success. [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2286.58s)]
*  Why am I in the clubs every single night? [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2290.2599999999998s)]
*  Right. [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2292.98s)]
*  You can be loosely funny now versus having to be, [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2293.82s)]
*  when you're on stage, it's like, no, it needs to be exact. [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2296.62s)]
*  Because you're in audiences there and it's an immediate [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2300.18s)]
*  reaction and now you can, it seems like you can shoot [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2302.18s)]
*  a bunch of videos and then you just finally pick one [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2305.74s)]
*  that works or, you know, whatever it is. [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2307.94s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2310.38s)]
*  Sorry guys, my stepdad's in the hospital. [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2311.46s)]
*  Not really, he actually passed away a couple years ago, [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2315.46s)]
*  but he, [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2317.2599999999998s)]
*  But he would be in the hospital. [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2319.74s)]
*  My mom thinks about him a lot. [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2320.94s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2322.06s)]
*  He would still be in the hospital [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2323.7s)]
*  if he was alive today, probably. [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2324.54s)]
*  He probably would, he was a warrior. [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2325.82s)]
*  He was a union guy. [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2327.3s)]
*  He didn't give up, he showed up. [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2328.86s)]
*  Even in a coma, he was there every fucking day. [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2330.5s)]
*  Non-responsive. [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2333.26s)]
*  Clocking in, clocking out. [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2335.6600000000003s)]
*  We like to call it active listening. [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2338.02s)]
*  That's active listening, is another positive way [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2340.34s)]
*  to say non-responsive. [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2342.42s)]
*  You think that, would you go get it all out to your, [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2343.78s)]
*  because a guy like that, if you have a dad like that, [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2346.1000000000004s)]
*  he probably didn't get to talk to him that much. [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2348.82s)]
*  So when he finally gets to that coma, [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2352.1000000000004s)]
*  you're like, go let it out. [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2353.42s)]
*  Oh, that's a great podcast idea, coma chatter. [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2355.38s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2358.1000000000004s)]
*  Bring sons in that never got to tell their dad [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2360.7400000000002s)]
*  they love them or something. [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2363.7400000000002s)]
*  Yeah, I've thought a lot about that, [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2366.02s)]
*  like a special, I've thought a lot about, [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2367.02s)]
*  I did this ketamine therapy where I got to, [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2369.94s)]
*  and there was a moment during it [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2371.6600000000003s)]
*  where I actually got to spend time with my dad, right? [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2373.86s)]
*  As real as you and I are sitting right here, [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2376.6600000000003s)]
*  that's as real as it felt on any sensory level, right? [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2378.54s)]
*  Which is crazy, I wouldn't just say that, [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2381.82s)]
*  I don't know ghosts or anything like that, [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2384.5s)]
*  I'm not that guy. [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2386.14s)]
*  But I got to spend time with him for maybe about like, [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2387.54s)]
*  what felt like maybe a minute or two minutes, [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2390.3s)]
*  where he was, it was as real as any sense of mine [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2392.2599999999998s)]
*  ever knew that anybody was real. [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2395.06s)]
*  So I think it'd be interesting if you had, [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2397.7s)]
*  I thought if they had like mannequins or something [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2400.42s)]
*  where you could bring your parents old clothing [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2402.14s)]
*  or something, or if your buddy got hit by a truck [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2403.94s)]
*  or something, or drove into like an embankment [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2405.9s)]
*  or something and died or something, he was peeled up. [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2408.74s)]
*  But you could go bring their stuff [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2411.14s)]
*  and then you spend time almost with the mannequin [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2413.94s)]
*  or maybe you put all of it into like a machine [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2415.7000000000003s)]
*  and the machine creates a hologram of them. [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2418.1800000000003s)]
*  And then you get to like, [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2420.7000000000003s)]
*  like I wonder if they'll have that kind of stuff [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2421.98s)]
*  in the future, you know? [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2423.38s)]
*  Or a place where you get to redo the dad's coma, you know? [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2424.5s)]
*  And there's like a fake dad in there laying in there, [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2428.1800000000003s)]
*  some guys like the new Santa or whatever, [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2430.2200000000003s)]
*  at the mall and he clocks in and you go in [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2432.1400000000003s)]
*  and you fucking sit by the bed for 40 minutes [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2434.0600000000004s)]
*  or whatever and get it out. [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2436.86s)]
*  But is ketamine a hallucinogen? [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2438.26s)]
*  Yeah, dude, this shit, definitely. [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2440.94s)]
*  Is that cat tranquilizer? [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2442.7s)]
*  Is that what it is? [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2444.9399999999996s)]
*  I wouldn't be shocked, dude. [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2445.7799999999997s)]
*  I'll tell you that. [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2447.2999999999997s)]
*  I used to do that on stage, I'd be like, [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2448.14s)]
*  are you guys all on ketamine? [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2450.22s)]
*  And then, cause you guys feel like tired cats. [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2451.4199999999996s)]
*  Why do you wanna feel like a tired cat? [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2454.2999999999997s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2456.06s)]
*  I didn't know it was a hallucinogen. [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2456.8999999999996s)]
*  I thought that was like acid or what's the other thing [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2457.74s)]
*  that's like acid, but it's safer and everybody, [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2461.5s)]
*  everybody does it now. [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2465.02s)]
*  You can do it. [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2466.2599999999998s)]
*  You have to, you can go to a place and do it. [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2467.1s)]
*  And I don't know. [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2469.74s)]
*  Oh, the thing Aaron Rodgers did? [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2470.94s)]
*  Yeah, it's like that kind of, it's like, [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2472.82s)]
*  Oh, ayahuasca. [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2474.26s)]
*  Ayahuasca, yeah. [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2475.1s)]
*  Oh, I felt like I was like a bit moji stuck in the back [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2476.5s)]
*  of like a, like a, I remember one time thinking [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2479.58s)]
*  I was like a, like a gigabyte or something [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2483.38s)]
*  stuck in the back corner of like a foot locker. [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2485.9s)]
*  Like I was fucking out there though. [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2489.82s)]
*  And where do you do this at? [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2491.7400000000002s)]
*  Like in a room? [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2493.1s)]
*  Yeah, just in a chill room. [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2494.46s)]
*  Like you, like you go somewhere to do it? [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2495.98s)]
*  There's like a therapist in there with you. [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2498.2200000000003s)]
*  So it's like guided meditation kind of while you're doing it. [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2499.66s)]
*  So you did that? [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2502.38s)]
*  Yeah, that was pretty cool. [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2503.2599999999998s)]
*  If you're just shooting up at a fucking outside [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2504.8199999999997s)]
*  of a Jimmy Johns or whatever, [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2506.38s)]
*  I don't think that's the way to, you know, do it. [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2507.5s)]
*  Yeah, I wasn't doing that. [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2510.62s)]
*  That's the old school. [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2512.66s)]
*  Yeah, that was for the freelance version, you know? [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2514.5s)]
*  But this is more, a little bit more sanctioned. [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2517.14s)]
*  But to get back what you're saying, [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2518.94s)]
*  yeah, I think it would be interesting [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2520.94s)]
*  if they had like kind of reenactment stuff [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2522.58s)]
*  where you could go through and redo it. [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2525.62s)]
*  Is that what we're talking about? [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2527.9s)]
*  Comas, how we getting there? [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2528.74s)]
*  Yeah, I like your podcast idea of going to somebody [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2530.22s)]
*  with a coma that you have a lot to get out [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2533.8199999999997s)]
*  and they're in a coma now and you could just tell everything. [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2535.58s)]
*  Just go 40 minutes, you know, just go 45 minutes. [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2538.2999999999997s)]
*  Just talking about your feelings with no, [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2542.1s)]
*  nothing coming back. [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2545.3399999999997s)]
*  Well, it's interesting, because sometimes you need that. [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2547.1s)]
*  You just post whatever the relationship, [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2549.3399999999997s)]
*  whatever the relationship is, [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2552.1s)]
*  and then you just go right into it. [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2553.22s)]
*  But I don't know if hospice would be cool with it. [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2555.4199999999996s)]
*  But also if you could get a blip on their thing, [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2557.78s)]
*  you'd fucking, that would be it. [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2559.86s)]
*  It'd be like blip hunters. [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2561.7400000000002s)]
*  And we go and we sit with somebody who's in a coma [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2563.0600000000004s)]
*  and they have their line or whatever on their heart reading. [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2565.5s)]
*  And if you can fucking get them to blip or something. [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2568.78s)]
*  You know you got through. [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2571.1000000000004s)]
*  That person wins, yeah. [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2572.2200000000003s)]
*  That's great, turn it into a game show. [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2574.3s)]
*  And if he doesn't, if you don't get a blip, [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2576.26s)]
*  then you're like, this guy's good. [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2578.1000000000004s)]
*  This guy. [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2579.7400000000002s)]
*  This guy. [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2580.5800000000004s)]
*  You're like, he doesn't feel anything. [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2581.42s)]
*  You're like, no, no, he's willing. [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2583.5400000000004s)]
*  Yeah, it would be, if you knew you were gonna die [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2586.5s)]
*  and still not give anything in at all, [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2592.62s)]
*  man, that's a strong person. [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2596.02s)]
*  You had to go to the grave with something? [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2598.94s)]
*  Right, yeah. [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2600.82s)]
*  I don't know if I'd go to the grave with all my secrets. [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2601.78s)]
*  You gotta tell him to somebody, tell him to a nephew. [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2607.14s)]
*  Tell him to somebody who doesn't need, you know. [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2609.78s)]
*  A nephew. [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2612.94s)]
*  Throw that all on a nephew, like a young nephew. [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2614.54s)]
*  Oh, a nephew's just a time capsule for your bullshit, [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2617.1800000000003s)]
*  I feel like, you know. [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2619.54s)]
*  Yeah, a nephew, yeah, it's like someone that's like, [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2620.5s)]
*  I didn't really know my uncle, [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2623.0600000000004s)]
*  and then I really knew my uncle. [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2624.34s)]
*  Like, just right before he died, he just unleashed on me. [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2626.0600000000004s)]
*  And I gotta carry that around. [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2630.02s)]
*  That's my mom he was talking to, like he got, [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2632.38s)]
*  you know, like just a lot. [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2634.5s)]
*  It's just a lot to throw on a nephew. [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2637.1400000000003s)]
*  But it's gotta go somewhere, you know what I mean? [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2639.1000000000004s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2641.26s)]
*  To get back to kind of what you guys were saying about, [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2642.3399999999997s)]
*  like yeah, I think having clips and stuff [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2645.42s)]
*  obviously is helpful to people these days. [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2647.42s)]
*  I think people more than ever want to see some person, [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2649.62s)]
*  a person get to know a person and their personality. [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2652.8199999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2655.06s)]
*  You know? [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2655.9s)]
*  I think it's even what's nice about being involved [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2656.74s)]
*  in like podcasting worlds. [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2658.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2659.58s)]
*  Is that people want to get to know somebody, [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2661.7s)]
*  because for so long it was so formulaic. [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2664.42s)]
*  It was like, you just got this person [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2666.62s)]
*  that had kind of been through this system. [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2670.94s)]
*  And the system was all kind of dictated, [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2673.66s)]
*  and that's who kind of got to a level [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2675.74s)]
*  where people were able to see their work. [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2678.2599999999998s)]
*  Right. [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2680.8199999999997s)]
*  You know, and now I think people are wanting to get [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2681.66s)]
*  to know people more. [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2685.86s)]
*  Right. [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2687.5s)]
*  Maybe, hypothetically I'm guessing. [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2688.3399999999997s)]
*  And then so they listen to podcasts [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2689.9s)]
*  and they get to know people, [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2691.42s)]
*  they get to know people that are on the episodes. [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2692.38s)]
*  It's a pretty small universe after a while. [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2694.14s)]
*  Yeah. Right. [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2696.3399999999997s)]
*  And then, and so then they feel a little bit more connection. [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2697.18s)]
*  So then when they're sitting in the audience, [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2700.7799999999997s)]
*  they're also getting to see this person. [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2701.8199999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2703.62s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2704.46s)]
*  This person and not just the material. [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2705.2999999999997s)]
*  They get to know where it kind of comes from. [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2709.58s)]
*  Right. [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2711.2599999999998s)]
*  Yeah, I think they, you know, [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2712.1s)]
*  I sat in the audience one night. [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2713.06s)]
*  I was watching a guy, a podcaster, [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2715.06s)]
*  and I was like, oh, a lot of the audience, [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2720.4199999999996s)]
*  I could feel it. [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2722.3799999999997s)]
*  They're just excited to be here in the room with me. [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2723.22s)]
*  Right. [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2725.2999999999997s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2726.14s)]
*  And I was like, man, yeah, this is cool. [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2727.82s)]
*  We're literally just hanging out with them here. [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2729.14s)]
*  If the material is good or bad, [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2731.7400000000002s)]
*  we're hanging out with them here. [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2733.82s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2735.02s)]
*  Pretty cool. [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2735.86s)]
*  Yeah, that's where the, you get, [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2736.7s)]
*  they got to feel the love though. [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2738.14s)]
*  Like it's like the, you know, like when you say, [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2739.7s)]
*  when people go see you live, [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2742.62s)]
*  it's, they want to be able to feel that appreciation [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2744.58s)]
*  you have for them coming out. [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2748.62s)]
*  And like that's, like that doesn't need [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2752.06s)]
*  to be taken advantage of. [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2754.66s)]
*  Cause it's, you know, people, it's, you know, [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2756.1s)]
*  expensive to go see anything or do anything anymore. [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2759.14s)]
*  And so they, they want to feel that you care [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2762.82s)]
*  as much as they do. [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2767.14s)]
*  That's a good point, man. [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2768.66s)]
*  I got to remember that sometimes to let people know [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2770.06s)]
*  that I care, you know, sometimes I've, [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2771.94s)]
*  I don't forget. [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2773.74s)]
*  I think it shows. [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2774.58s)]
*  It's going to show. [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2775.7799999999997s)]
*  I think it shows. [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2776.94s)]
*  I've seen your shows and I think it shows. [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2777.7799999999997s)]
*  And it's, and that's an important thing. [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2780.46s)]
*  There's people that don't have that. [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2784.66s)]
*  And I mean, I think a big aspect of Hollywood [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2787.82s)]
*  doesn't have that anymore. [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2791.26s)]
*  And the stuff that they, a lot of stuff they make [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2792.2200000000003s)]
*  is so disconnected and it's, that it's, [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2794.5s)]
*  it doesn't translate. [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2799.66s)]
*  That's why Top Gun was the biggest movie. [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2800.78s)]
*  Cause it was like, not that you're going to relate to it, [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2802.94s)]
*  but it was like, you felt the appreciation of just [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2806.2200000000003s)]
*  as a movie goer to be like, you gave me a fun movie, dude. [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2808.34s)]
*  Like it was just, I had a good time. [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2811.18s)]
*  And it wasn't this giant, heavy, whatever thing. [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2813.18s)]
*  It was just a good time. [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2817.58s)]
*  And it was a time when everybody needed that to go. [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2818.8199999999997s)]
*  I just need to go have some fun. [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2822.22s)]
*  Fucking fun for two hours. [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2823.58s)]
*  Yeah. And everybody had a blast. [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2824.8199999999997s)]
*  Tom Cruise does an amazing job with that. [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2826.62s)]
*  With a- [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2828.58s)]
*  That's a good point. [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2829.4199999999996s)]
*  Yeah. All Mission Impossible, all that. [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2830.62s)]

*  It's just super fun. [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2833.7799999999997s)]
*  And then other movies are, these movies, [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2835.18s)]
*  a lot of times in Oscars where people, you're like, [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2837.2999999999997s)]

*  this artistic masterpiece or whatever. [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2842.86s)]
*  But you're like- [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2844.82s)]
*  Yeah, like Gay Da Vinci or something. [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2845.82s)]
*  It's always like, if somebody was gay, [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2847.46s)]
*  that we can't ask if they're gay anymore. [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2848.94s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2850.6600000000003s)]
*  You know? [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2851.5s)]

*  It's like, they're just like, that's true, dude. [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2864.26s)]
*  Why has Hollywood got so disconnected, you think? [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2866.1s)]
*  I thought the movies in the 80s were great, man. [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2869.1s)]
*  They were great. [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2870.98s)]
*  It was just like fun, whatever. [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2872.6200000000003s)]
*  And no one, I think that now we overthink everything. [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2874.1000000000004s)]
*  It's like, yeah, if something was potentially offensive, [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2876.54s)]
*  it'd be like, maybe they probably didn't mean it that way. [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2879.7400000000002s)]
*  They were just trying to have fun. [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2882.46s)]
*  So everybody just didn't take it for more [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2883.98s)]
*  than it actually was. [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2885.9s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2887.1800000000003s)]
*  So now I think we're just so hypersensitive. [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2888.02s)]
*  They're not, yeah, I don't think they're relatable. [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2890.34s)]
*  Or like, there's not, you used to go, [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2895.34s)]
*  I think go to the movies and you could be, [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2896.86s)]
*  like that was you in the movie. [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2898.34s)]
*  You could relate to it. [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2900.5s)]
*  You could see, you know, Ferris Bueller's Day Off, right? [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2902.46s)]
*  Like it's like a kid that's skipping school [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2906.46s)]
*  and it's an extreme version of it, [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2909.66s)]
*  but it's a fun version. [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2911.18s)]
*  That's why I- [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2912.26s)]
*  Vacation. [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2913.1s)]
*  Vacation is like, everybody's been on that vacation. [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2913.94s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2916.22s)]
*  Family just gone and everything goes wrong. [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2917.22s)]
*  That's why Entourage was so big. [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2919.06s)]
*  Cause Entourage was just like, yeah, if you made it [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2921.22s)]
*  and you're like, this is me and my boys. [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2923.54s)]

*  They were living it up. [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2928.26s)]
*  That's why that show and that even the movie, [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2930.34s)]
*  like dudes loved it cause it was just like, [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2933.78s)]

*  I went back and watched the whole Entourage. [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2961.3s)]
*  Oh, Entourage, I've never seen it. [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2963.82s)]
*  Oh, it's great. [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2965.34s)]

*  You guys saving anything? [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2985.78s)]
*  I watched The Wire, and that was a lot. [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2987.86s)]
*  I didn't really, like it was, [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2991.86s)]
*  I need to probably go watch it again. [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2994.06s)]
*  It just feels like a whole thing. [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2995.62s)]
*  I was really blown away by The Wire. [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2997.46s)]
*  I was really blown away by it. [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2998.3s)]
*  I thought it was- [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2999.14s)]
*  College educated. [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=2999.98s)]
*  I thought it was the greatest thing. [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=3000.82s)]
*  Yeah, it's probably for a smarter crowd. [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=3001.66s)]
*  But I just thought it was unbelievable. [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=3004.9s)]
*  And I thought The Sopranos was really good, [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=3008.34s)]
*  but The Wire is just so well done. [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=3010.14s)]
*  Yeah, I like the credit for that. [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=3012.42s)]
*  And didn't get the credit it deserved at the time, obviously. [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=3013.2599999999998s)]
*  The Wire did. [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=3016.94s)]
*  No, not at the time. [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=3017.86s)]
*  When it was on, it didn't get the credit. [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=3019.38s)]
*  But afterwards, people are like, it's brilliant. [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=3021.02s)]
*  It's a great show. [[00:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=3023.98s)]
*  I mean, most people, not you. [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=3025.22s)]
*  I think it's supposedly great. [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=3026.74s)]
*  It's great. [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=3028.9s)]
*  I think it was just a lot. [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=3030.2999999999997s)]
*  It's a lot of talking, right? [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=3032.7s)]
*  Yeah, it's a lot of talking. [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=3034.34s)]
*  It's a lot. [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=3035.58s)]
*  It's an intricate story. [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=3036.62s)]
*  But the guys were writers in Baltimore. [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=3038.38s)]
*  The guy who created it was a beat writer in Baltimore. [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=3040.8199999999997s)]
*  So that's why. [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=3045.7799999999997s)]
*  It's like you could see that guy actually knew [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=3046.58s)]
*  what was going on instead of most cop shows, [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=3049.4199999999996s)]
*  which is a caricature of what's going on. [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=3052.06s)]

*  So like Sammy the Bull, I watch his. [[00:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=3463.62s)]
*  It's fascinating. [[00:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=3465.9s)]
*  Graviano, is that him? [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=3466.7799999999997s)]
*  Graviano. [[00:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=3467.8999999999996s)]
*  Graviano, yeah. [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=3468.74s)]
*  That sounds like some kind of a gravy [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=3470.58s)]
*  that you would get at a. [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=3472.2999999999997s)]
*  Graviano. [[00:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=3473.14s)]
*  Graviano. [[00:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=3473.9799999999996s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=3474.8199999999997s)]
*  You would ask what that is at the restaurant, [[00:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=3475.66s)]
*  you'd go, what's this Graviano? [[00:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=3476.4799999999996s)]
*  You gotta look it up. [[00:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=3477.7s)]
*  Like it's French. [[00:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=3480.02s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=3480.8599999999997s)]
*  We can't afford it. [[00:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=3482.74s)]
*  He was like. [[00:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=3485.18s)]
*  We'd take one for the table. [[00:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=3486.02s)]
*  He was. [[00:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=3486.8599999999997s)]
*  If you don't mind splitting that appetizer. [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=3488.74s)]
*  He was the underboss of the Gambino crime family. [[00:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=3491.9399999999996s)]
*  He flipped in like 1990, 91. [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=3493.9799999999996s)]
*  And he did. [[00:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=3497.66s)]
*  He got out of prison in five years [[00:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=3498.8999999999996s)]
*  because of his cooperation. [[00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=3500.62s)]
*  But then he got caught in an ecstasy ring in Arizona [[00:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=3501.8199999999997s)]
*  and went back and did 20 years. [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=3504.7799999999997s)]
*  And then he got out. [[00:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=3506.46s)]
*  So now he has this podcast and he's telling these stories [[00:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=3507.46s)]
*  and they're just riveting. [[00:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=3510.2599999999998s)]
*  So he was a very high ranking member. [[00:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=3511.94s)]
*  Plus John Gotti, everybody knows his name. [[00:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=3513.3799999999997s)]
*  He is big name recognition. [[00:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=3517.2999999999997s)]
*  So he's probably the most highest profile guy [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=3520.42s)]
*  because he was an underboss of a huge crime family. [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=3526.94s)]
*  But Michael Francis is another guy [[00:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=3529.74s)]
*  who was a Colombo captain. [[00:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=3531.54s)]
*  So the higher rank you are, I think, [[00:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=3534.8199999999997s)]
*  the bigger your following is coming up when you flip. [[00:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=3537.62s)]
*  Do you have to be pure Italian to be in the mafia? [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=3541.8599999999997s)]
*  They had a rule where it was for a long time [[00:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=3545.06s)]
*  that you had to be Italian on both sides. [[00:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=3548.24s)]
*  I mean, way back in the day, [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=3550.2s)]
*  I think you had to be Sicilian on both sides. [[00:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=3551.14s)]
*  But then Italian on both sides. [[00:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=3554.1s)]
*  And then as, I think now your father has to be Italian [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=3556.5s)]
*  because you've become what your father, [[00:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=3560.62s)]
*  that's the way they look at it, what your father. [[00:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=3562.22s)]
*  But they're not like now. [[00:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=3564.5s)]
*  Now it's like they don't kill anymore. [[00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=3568.1s)]
*  There was a thing on the commission where they were like, [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=3570.5s)]
*  not because they're more moral or anything. [[00:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=3573.02s)]
*  Did PETA got to them? [[00:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=3574.94s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=3576.06s)]
*  What's the commission? [[00:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=3576.9s)]
*  The commission is the bosses of the five families [[00:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=3578.02s)]
*  in New York and then families from other cities. [[00:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=3580.98s)]
*  They sit on a national commission [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=3583.14s)]
*  and decide policies for the entire mafia in the, [[00:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=3584.86s)]
*  it's all connected. [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=3588.3399999999997s)]
*  Like at an elk lodge. [[00:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=3589.18s)]
*  They meet up. [[00:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=3590.2599999999998s)]
*  Like Knights of Columbus. [[00:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=3591.1s)]
*  Yeah, Knights of Columbus. [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=3592.2999999999997s)]
*  I think I did a show for them. [[00:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=3593.86s)]
*  Is there still the mafia? [[00:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=3597.2999999999997s)]
*  There is, but they don't, they, [[00:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=3599.3399999999997s)]
*  I don't know what the, this is in your wheelhouse, [[01:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=3601.9s)]
*  because I don't know what the word, [[01:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=3604.18s)]
*  what's moratorium? [[01:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=3605.02s)]
*  Oh, moratorium? [[01:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=3606.98s)]
*  Yeah, what's that mean? [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=3608.06s)]
*  I think it's a moratorium on killing, [[01:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=3609.38s)]
*  which is like they don't do it anymore. [[01:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=3611.18s)]
*  They don't kill anymore. [[01:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=3613.5800000000004s)]
*  And it's not because they're moral. [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=3614.46s)]
*  Is it more a temporary probate? [[01:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=3616.5400000000004s)]
*  I used it right. [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=3618.0600000000004s)]
*  Okay, temporary probation of an activity. [[01:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=3619.02s)]
*  Yeah, so it's a moratorium on killing, [[01:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=3621.02s)]
*  which means it's not because they're moral people [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=3622.98s)]
*  or anything. [[01:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=3626.78s)]
*  It's just that they'll get 30 year sentences for murder. [[01:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=3627.6200000000003s)]
*  Like if there's a murder conspiracy or something, [[01:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=3631.5400000000004s)]
*  if they get charged with racketeering, you know, [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=3634.6200000000003s)]
*  or gambling, they might do five years, seven years. [[01:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=3637.38s)]
*  And these guys can do five and seven and 10 years. [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=3639.78s)]
*  That's not a big deal to them. [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=3642.18s)]
*  But if there's a murder conspiracy wrapped into that, [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=3643.66s)]
*  it automatically goes to 30 years. [[01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=3646.6s)]
*  So they, and because there's so many cooperators now, [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=3648.66s)]
*  they go, okay, it's not profitable for us [[01:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=3651.18s)]
*  to kill each other anymore. [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=3653.66s)]
*  So what they do now, I think, [[01:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=3655.06s)]
*  is they just put guys on shelves. [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=3656.22s)]
*  It's called putting a guy on a shelf, [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=3658.62s)]
*  which is they just don't talk to him anymore, [[01:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=3659.8599999999997s)]
*  and he's not allowed to be involved at any mob activity. [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=3662.18s)]
*  Wow. [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=3664.62s)]
*  So it's interesting. [[01:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=3665.46s)]
*  It's like a timeout kind of. [[01:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=3666.2999999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=3667.14s)]
*  Yeah, it's like a timeout, [[01:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=3667.98s)]
*  but they could have been doing that all along. [[01:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=3668.7999999999997s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=3670.8199999999997s)]
*  You didn't have to kill anybody ever. [[01:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=3672.14s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=3673.3399999999997s)]
*  That's what we don't realize. [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=3674.16s)]
*  What would we talk about now, [[01:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=3675.0s)]
*  if throughout history they hadn't all been [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=3676.8199999999997s)]
*  killing each other? [[01:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=3678.22s)]
*  If they'd been just timeout, it would have been, [[01:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=3679.06s)]
*  yeah, you wouldn't have taken them serious. [[01:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=3680.74s)]
*  Will you go put me in timeout? [[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=3682.46s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=3683.74s)]
*  And he goes, yeah, yeah, I will. [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=3684.58s)]
*  But the thing about that is, [[01:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=3687.06s)]
*  I don't know how they threaten each other now. [[01:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=3688.0s)]
*  It's like, you owe me money. [[01:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=3689.46s)]
*  The whole big thing I had over you, [[01:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=3691.02s)]
*  they was like, you better pay me, or I might kill you. [[01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=3692.3799999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=3695.3399999999997s)]
*  You know, like I say, I have a dangerous reputation. [[01:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=3696.18s)]
*  So now that people know, it's like, [[01:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=3699.0s)]
*  oh, there's no more killing. [[01:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=3700.56s)]
*  It's like, I guess I could hurt you. [[01:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=3701.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=3703.96s)]
*  I could take a talk about you. [[01:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=3704.7999999999997s)]
*  That's true. [[01:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=3706.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=3707.24s)]
*  I could tweet it. [[01:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=3708.08s)]
*  I could cancel you. [[01:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=3708.9s)]
*  Yes. [[01:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=3709.74s)]
*  Maybe they could threaten that. [[01:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=3710.58s)]
*  Right. [[01:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=3711.4s)]
*  They're gonna just put it out, [[01:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=3712.24s)]
*  like this guy talks about women pretty roughly. [[01:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=3713.06s)]
*  You know, like don't do that to me, dude. [[01:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=3715.2s)]
*  Don't do that. [[01:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=3717.4s)]
*  I have a family. [[01:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=3718.24s)]
*  I have daughters. [[01:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=3719.74s)]

*  so what are the mob, what's their crime now? [[01:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=3725.2s)]
*  It's mostly gambling. [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=3728.72s)]
*  Even though gambling is legal. [[01:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=3729.9s)]
*  Loitering. [[01:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=3731.3s)]
*  They're not doing anything anymore. [[01:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=3732.14s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=3732.98s)]
*  They're hanging out. [[01:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=3733.8s)]
*  Yeah, that is loitering. [[01:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=3734.64s)]
*  Do you make money on loitering? [[01:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=3735.48s)]
*  Loitering? [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=3736.3s)]
*  Loitering. [[01:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=3737.14s)]
*  It's loitering. [[01:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=3737.98s)]
*  Loitering. [[01:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=3738.82s)]
*  It's gambling, and they still have union, [[01:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=3740.02s)]
*  they're corrupted unions and stuff. [[01:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=3743.1800000000003s)]
*  Like a lot of trash and recycling. [[01:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=3745.58s)]
*  That's all a lot of business. [[01:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=3747.98s)]
*  Yeah, hauling, that kind of thing. [[01:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=3748.82s)]
*  Yeah, recycling's always a loose, [[01:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=3750.2200000000003s)]
*  you're like, what is, [[01:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=3751.7400000000002s)]
*  recycling, I don't know if I believe in recycling. [[01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=3753.3s)]
*  Well, some weeks they pick up the bins, [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=3756.06s)]
*  some weeks they don't. [[01:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=3757.1800000000003s)]
*  Yeah, what are they doing? [[01:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=3758.02s)]
*  You ever see, Atlanta's airport has a recycling thing, [[01:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=3759.06s)]
*  and it says paper, or bottles, paper, [[01:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=3762.42s)]
*  and then regular trash, and if you look inside of it, [[01:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=3766.38s)]
*  it just goes to the, it's one bag. [[01:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=3768.9s)]
*  It's not separated. [[01:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=3771.48s)]
*  It's at Atlanta's airport, and you're like, [[01:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=3773.2599999999998s)]
*  well, we're not even doing it. [[01:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=3775.4s)]
*  Well, I think there's cameras to see [[01:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=3776.82s)]
*  what kind of a person you are. [[01:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=3778.14s)]
*  That's what it's about, yeah. [[01:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=3779.62s)]
*  And then it affects your credit score, probably. [[01:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=3781.02s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=3782.7799999999997s)]
*  That's how the New York water system is, too. [[01:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=3783.82s)]
*  It's just all the same thing. [[01:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=3785.74s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=3787.18s)]
*  What the fuck, and I'm over there watching a Lego set [[01:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=3788.58s)]
*  go into someone's house. [[01:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=3791.58s)]
*  First of all, also, why did they have it court ordered? [[01:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=3792.74s)]
*  Why were they having court ordered people [[01:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=3795.06s)]
*  work at the water facility? [[01:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=3797.54s)]
*  That seems like. [[01:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=3798.78s)]
*  Yeah, you'd want to protect the water. [[01:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=3799.82s)]
*  Well, you'd want a technician or something. [[01:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=3802.1s)]
*  I remember they put these goggles on us, [[01:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=3804.46s)]
*  and I'm out there just making sure [[01:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=3805.9s)]
*  that there's nothing in it. [[01:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=3808.82s)]
*  Fuck, I don't fucking know what's in it. [[01:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=3809.98s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=3811.7s)]
*  Oh, yeah, you're really doing science stuff. [[01:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=3812.74s)]
*  I guess. [[01:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=3815.62s)]
*  I mean, you had to have like handies and footies on [[01:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=3816.5s)]
*  or whatever, and then you were out there [[01:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=3820.58s)]
*  and you were just watching the tanks, you know? [[01:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=3822.98s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=3825.58s)]
*  I guess, yeah. [[01:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=3826.42s)]
*  Why would they have criminals, basically? [[01:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=3827.26s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=3829.62s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[01:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=3830.46s)]
*  There's no background check. [[01:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=3831.3s)]
*  Yeah, this might have been mob related. [[01:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=3832.42s)]
*  Yeah, this really could be. [[01:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=3834.14s)]
*  Oh, we got dirty water, huh? [[01:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=3835.42s)]
*  That's my fucking mob name, dirty water. [[01:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=3836.98s)]
*  Was the mob in the South? [[01:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=3838.82s)]
*  No, they never, I mean. [[01:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=3840.86s)]
*  Florida, but. [[01:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=3842.58s)]
*  Florida, but New Orleans. [[01:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=3843.78s)]
*  Carlos Marcello was in, they were actually responsible [[01:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=3846.06s)]
*  for the Kennedy assassination, those guys. [[01:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=3848.74s)]
*  Wow. [[01:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=3850.98s)]
*  Some of the bosses, like Carlos Marcello, [[01:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=3851.82s)]
*  I think was one of them who put together [[01:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=3853.66s)]
*  the Kennedy assassination. [[01:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=3856.38s)]
*  Wow. [[01:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=3859.66s)]
*  The guys who really did it. [[01:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=3860.5s)]
*  Yeah, I watched something on that where it was like eight, [[01:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=3861.34s)]
*  it was supposed to be like eight dudes. [[01:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=3862.86s)]
*  A lot more people were involved. [[01:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=3864.54s)]
*  Yeah, it doesn't seem like one dude. [[01:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=3866.86s)]
*  Well, part of the Irishmen was like that, [[01:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=3867.7s)]
*  where it was like they were transferring guns over to, [[01:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=3869.1s)]
*  because I mean, that's just too convenient [[01:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=3872.1s)]
*  that Jack Ruby, who was an associate of, [[01:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=3873.7s)]
*  I believe the Chicago mob, he was in Texas, [[01:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=3877.02s)]
*  in Texas at the time and he, Oswald was the passing, [[01:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=3882.2999999999997s)]
*  and then he shot Oswald on TV. [[01:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=3886.14s)]
*  It's like he was direct, he owned strip clubs in Texas [[01:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=3888.02s)]
*  and was directly connected with the Chicago outfit. [[01:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=3891.5s)]
*  So that makes a lot of sense, you think? [[01:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=3895.66s)]
*  I think it makes a lot of, [[01:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=3897.3799999999997s)]
*  I think they were the ones who did it, [[01:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=3898.22s)]
*  they felt, I mean, you could hear them on wiretap, [[01:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=3899.8199999999997s)]
*  they were illegal wiretaps at the time, [[01:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=3903.18s)]
*  but they were furious that they felt like [[01:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=3904.34s)]
*  they got Kennedy elected through their unions. [[01:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=3907.74s)]
*  And he turned on them? [[01:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=3910.5s)]
*  And he turned on them with Robert Kennedy [[01:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=3911.98s)]
*  as the eternal judge just going after them. [[01:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=3913.42s)]
*  And they were like, and those guys were like, [[01:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=3915.14s)]
*  not what they are today, they were very, very serious guys [[01:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=3917.14s)]
*  and they could get stuff done. [[01:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=3920.18s)]
*  They would not care, they would not bat an eye at it. [[01:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=3922.1s)]
*  So I think they were the ones who did it. [[01:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=3924.82s)]
*  Why, that really sounds really, really realistic. [[01:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=3929.14s)]
*  Then just that some got, [[01:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=3932.54s)]
*  then a lot of other vague kind of rushing conspiracy stuff. [[01:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=3934.74s)]
*  That sounds a little more far-fetched. [[01:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=3937.7799999999997s)]
*  Yeah, that Oliver Stone thing was like, [[01:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=3939.2999999999997s)]
*  the Cubans were involved at this level. [[01:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=3941.74s)]
*  The Italians were, I don't think it was like that. [[01:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=3943.54s)]
*  I think it was one group. [[01:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=3944.98s)]
*  And I think it was the mob at the time. [[01:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=3946.18s)]
*  And they were just like, we've had it with this guy. [[01:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=3948.94s)]
*  He's like, he's putting pressure on us. [[01:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=3951.06s)]
*  And the thing was, I was like, oh, kill Robert Kennedy. [[01:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=3954.66s)]
*  It's like, no, the whole thing that they said [[01:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=3958.54s)]
*  is cut the horse's head off and the body will die, [[01:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=3960.94s)]
*  which means kill the president [[01:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=3963.94s)]
*  and then his attorney general will be ineffective. [[01:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=3965.94s)]
*  But he killed him, then they kill him? [[01:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=3968.58s)]
*  They killed John F. Kennedy, but then Robert Kennedy [[01:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=3971.02s)]
*  was killed by Sir Heinz Sir Heinz, [[01:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=3974.02s)]
*  who was not related to anything. [[01:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=3975.62s)]
*  Bobby Kennedy's been on here before. [[01:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=3977.1800000000003s)]
*  He's a friend of mine, his Robert Kennedy's son. [[01:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=3978.42s)]
*  Oh really? Yeah. [[01:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=3981.1800000000003s)]
*  I think he might be running for [[01:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=3982.1800000000003s)]
*  for the Democratic nomination maybe. [[01:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=3985.02s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=3986.98s)]
*  Because he's a Democrat. [[01:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=3987.94s)]
*  He's a Democrat, but he's kind of like a new Democrat, [[01:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=3988.82s)]
*  I think you would almost think. [[01:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=3992.2200000000003s)]
*  I think that party needs to kind of like [[01:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=3993.14s)]
*  figure itself out a little bit. [[01:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=3995.62s)]
*  They've gone off the deep end. [[01:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=3997.62s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[01:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=3998.98s)]
*  You know everything, it's like, [[01:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4000.1s)]
*  if you're not like a trans cornrow or something, [[01:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4002.02s)]
*  you're not even getting elected. [[01:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4007.34s)]
*  Right. [[01:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4008.5s)]
*  Yeah, I watched the thing with the JFK. [[01:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4009.94s)]
*  There's shooters. [[01:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4016.38s)]
*  There's someone in a sewer. [[01:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4018.42s)]
*  Yeah, crazy. [[01:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4019.62s)]
*  You ever hear of the sewer? [[01:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4020.46s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4021.2999999999997s)]
*  Well the grassy knoll thing I think is, [[01:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4022.14s)]
*  I mean explains it for me, [[01:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4023.5s)]
*  it's like there was gunmen in that grassy knoll [[01:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4024.42s)]
*  and the way that the elaborate way that they set it up, [[01:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4026.74s)]
*  I mean just for the disappearance of Hoffa, [[01:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4029.66s)]
*  how that could like, how prominent that guy was [[01:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4033.2999999999997s)]
*  and how famous that guy was and for him just to be, [[01:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4036.1s)]
*  for them just to go, he needs to, [[01:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4039.18s)]
*  like he was worn like in the movie, [[01:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4041.18s)]
*  like the Irishman, I don't know if you guys saw that, [[01:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4043.14s)]
*  but he was, the story's like he's worn several times [[01:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4045.14s)]
*  because he goes to prison, he comes out [[01:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4048.58s)]
*  and he wants to take the union back [[01:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4049.42s)]
*  and his predecessor, Frank Fitzsimmons, [[01:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4050.66s)]
*  was the head of the unit and they loved dealing with him [[01:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4053.18s)]
*  more because Hoffa would resist them a little bit, [[01:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4055.8199999999997s)]
*  I'll give you this, you give me this, he'd work with them, [[01:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4058.1s)]
*  but he wasn't a complete patsy for them. [[01:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4060.5s)]
*  Fitzsimmons would just give them whatever they wanted. [[01:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4062.18s)]
*  So once Fitzsimmons was in, they were like, [[01:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4064.46s)]
*  we're just, we're better off with him [[01:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4066.98s)]
*  being the union president and Hoffa was like, [[01:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4070.14s)]
*  no, I want my union back and they warned him several times, [[01:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4071.62s)]
*  like back off, you're a nice man, you have a nice family, [[01:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4074.06s)]
*  back off and he's like, I want my union, I want my union [[01:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4078.1800000000003s)]
*  and finally they were like, okay, that's it [[01:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4079.7400000000002s)]
*  and they made this guy of this level of fame just disappear [[01:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4083.1400000000003s)]
*  and they had to know like the heat was gonna come down, [[01:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4089.3s)]
*  there was gonna be search for him, [[01:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4091.06s)]
*  they're like, no body, no crime, just nobody talked [[01:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4092.02s)]
*  and it's just whatever, it's insane. [[01:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4096.54s)]
*  What do they think, do they think he's buried [[01:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4098.900000000001s)]
*  or they just probably burn it? [[01:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4101.34s)]
*  I think what happened was they killed him at that, [[01:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4103.7s)]
*  like they killed him and then they brought him to, [[01:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4108.34s)]
*  they were all connected with legitimate businesses, [[01:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4112.22s)]
*  so they brought him to a mortuary or whatever [[01:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4114.5s)]
*  and had him cremated and then his ashes. [[01:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4117.3s)]
*  Who is that, Fitzsimmons? [[01:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4120.38s)]
*  No, Hoffa. [[01:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4121.74s)]
*  Oh, Hoffa. [[01:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4122.78s)]
*  Yeah, I think they just, they killed him in a quiet, [[01:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4123.62s)]
*  like a house somewhere, like in the movie. [[01:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4127.18s)]
*  I don't know if that movie is true, [[01:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4129.22s)]
*  I don't know if that guy, the Irishman killed him [[01:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4131.26s)]
*  but he was killed at like a quiet residence [[01:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4134.06s)]
*  with somebody they were connected to [[01:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4136.860000000001s)]
*  and then other guys, I think the body, [[01:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4138.54s)]
*  I think that's true though, that whoever killed him [[01:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4140.860000000001s)]
*  shot him and left and then they had a second crew of guys [[01:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4143.62s)]
*  take him and dispose of the body. [[01:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4148.400000000001s)]
*  That way if it's ever prosecuted, like they, you know. [[01:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4150.42s)]
*  There's two parts of it. [[01:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4154.860000000001s)]
*  Yeah, there's two parts of it and they, [[01:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4155.7s)]
*  If you don't get both of them. [[01:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4156.820000000001s)]
*  If the shooter's like, well, where's the body? [[01:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4157.66s)]
*  It's like, well, I don't know where it is. [[01:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4159.5s)]
*  It's like, cause they had other guys come in [[01:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4161.46s)]
*  and dispose of the body. [[01:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4162.74s)]
*  Oh, that's smart, huh? [[01:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4163.58s)]
*  Yeah, it's smart. [[01:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4164.42s)]
*  Now you're also. [[01:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4165.259999999999s)]
*  They were like very intelligent guy, I mean, evil, [[01:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4166.08s)]
*  obviously, but like very intelligent in terms of like [[01:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4168.94s)]
*  how they got away with that. [[01:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4171.9s)]
*  And granted, there wasn't the cameras [[01:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4173.78s)]
*  and the documentation that's required today [[01:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4175.379999999999s)]
*  but the way they did it is just, I mean, [[01:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4177.74s)]
*  that guy was one of the most famous people [[01:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4180.66s)]
*  in the country, if not the world [[01:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4184.0199999999995s)]
*  and they just disappeared him. [[01:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4185.82s)]
*  That's crazy. [[01:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4187.7s)]
*  I wonder if I'd be good at mafiosoing. [[01:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4188.78s)]
*  Do you think you'd, do you have any of that? [[01:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4191.66s)]
*  And you said in the beginning, you got that dog in you [[01:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4194.179999999999s)]
*  when it comes to wrestling. [[01:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4195.94s)]
*  You got that ability to work hard. [[01:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4196.86s)]
*  Where would you have been in the mafia, you think? [[01:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4199.259999999999s)]
*  There's three kinds of mafia guys. [[01:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4201.42s)]
*  There's guys who make a lot of money. [[01:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4202.82s)]
*  There's guys who are stone cold killers [[01:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4205.42s)]
*  and then there are guys who are both, [[01:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4208.0199999999995s)]
*  which is the rarest. [[01:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4210.259999999999s)]
*  So the guys who are stone cold killers [[01:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4211.94s)]
*  call the money guys. [[01:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4214.54s)]
*  It's like, oh, you guys are soft [[01:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4215.7s)]
*  cause you can't kill anybody. [[01:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4216.88s)]
*  And the money guys go to the stone cold killers [[01:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4217.94s)]
*  and they're like, you can't make any money. [[01:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4219.94s)]
*  You're hanging on to us because we're making all the money. [[01:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4220.9s)]
*  And the guys who are both are like the most dangerous guys. [[01:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4223.74s)]
*  Who would have been both? [[01:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4228.0599999999995s)]
*  Well, they say that Sammy the Bull was both. [[01:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4230.259999999999s)]
*  He was a stone cold killer and he was involved in unions [[01:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4232.099999999999s)]
*  and like he kept the money. [[01:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4234.66s)]
*  And now he has a podcast. [[01:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4235.5s)]
*  And now he has a podcast. [[01:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4236.46s)]
*  So that just shows you right there [[01:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4237.94s)]
*  where it's all heading, you know? [[01:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4240.179999999999s)]
*  Are we gonna get to the point though [[01:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4242.46s)]
*  where we've run out of the ability, [[01:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4243.7s)]
*  we've run out of the time where anybody's done anything [[01:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4246.82s)]
*  and now we're all just talking about things [[01:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4250.42s)]
*  that are being done. [[01:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4252.42s)]
*  That's true. [[01:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4253.34s)]
*  That is possible. [[01:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4254.18s)]
*  Yeah, that is very true. [[01:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4255.0199999999995s)]
*  I think about that, what did I think about that recently? [[01:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4258.22s)]
*  Cause it was like, your, well, college is a point of, [[01:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4261.82s)]
*  I think a lot of colleges, [[01:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4269.78s)]
*  no one's actually doing something. [[01:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4272.1s)]
*  Right. [[01:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4274.18s)]
*  Everybody's, there's a lot of talking [[01:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4275.660000000001s)]
*  and there's a lot of, you know, [[01:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4278.3s)]
*  but no one's living the way that they're talking. [[01:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4279.740000000001s)]
*  Cause it's a lot of work. [[01:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4282.34s)]
*  I'm reading a book, The Atomic Habits. [[01:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4284.06s)]
*  And I was talking to him about it. [[01:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4289.3s)]
*  Like, cause I'm trying to build more habits in my life. [[01:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4291.38s)]
*  Like I have a, with food, like, so I, [[01:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4295.5s)]
*  I weighed like almost 200 pounds or 195, [[01:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4299.38s)]
*  like the last February. [[01:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4302.22s)]
*  And like, is that a lot? [[01:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4305.1s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4308.06s)]
*  For me, I don't have the frame to, it was just, [[01:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4309.14s)]
*  I'm gonna just eat fast food and whatever, eat garbage. [[01:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4312.14s)]
*  And so then I went hard and lost weight for this, [[01:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4315.62s)]
*  for my special Hello World. [[01:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4319.98s)]
*  And I got down to 160. [[01:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4321.66s)]
*  And then, so I'm doing Red Rocks coming up in May. [[01:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4323.66s)]
*  And the whole point was I started this journey. [[01:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4326.98s)]
*  I did like a before picture at Red Rocks. [[01:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4329.38s)]
*  I wasn't playing Red Rocks, [[01:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4331.22s)]
*  but I was, I went there and, [[01:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4333.38s)]
*  cause I was in Denver doing a show somewhere else. [[01:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4335.74s)]
*  And I took before pictures and then I was like, [[01:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4337.38s)]
*  oh, maybe by the time I can play here, I'll be skinny. [[01:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4339.1s)]
*  And then I get down to 160 and now I've gained it back. [[01:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4342.46s)]
*  And I'm gonna end up going back to Red Rocks. [[01:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4345.9400000000005s)]
*  And I'm not gonna be skinny. [[01:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4347.38s)]
*  I'm gonna be back to almost, not, I mean, I'm starting to go, [[01:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4348.5s)]
*  I'll be less, but you know, it's like, [[01:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4351.26s)]
*  my goal did not work out. [[01:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4353.18s)]
*  And it's very frustrating and very like, [[01:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4355.3s)]
*  you're just like, kind of like depressed, [[01:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4358.82s)]
*  like just like, ugh, like I, why can't I just keep this? [[01:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4360.34s)]
*  A good pattern, a good pattern. [[01:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4365.5s)]
*  A good pattern, yeah. [[01:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4366.34s)]
*  Why I'm so addicted to this food that I can't, I spiral out. [[01:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4367.34s)]
*  And then I like had the motivation for the special, [[01:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4371.06s)]
*  like you can get excited about something, [[01:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4374.1s)]
*  but how do you keep that going? [[01:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4376.18s)]
*  You know, you kind of, I hit the goal of the special. [[01:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4377.860000000001s)]
*  I'm 160, I've lost 45 pounds or something. [[01:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4380.26s)]
*  And then I just, now I'm back to 180. [[01:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4383.62s)]
*  And you're like, I don't, and you're like, [[01:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4385.9800000000005s)]
*  why can't I keep that going? [[01:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4387.66s)]
*  Because it's so hard to actually do the work. [[01:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4389.58s)]
*  Like to actually, to actually continue to do, [[01:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4392.86s)]
*  it's very easy. [[01:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4396.0599999999995s)]
*  I can talk about it. [[01:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4396.9s)]
*  I can tell you all the stuff that you gotta do. [[01:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4397.74s)]
*  And you go, we gotta drink more water [[01:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4399.3s)]
*  and we gotta do all these things, but I can't do it. [[01:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4400.58s)]
*  I can't physically do it. [[01:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4403.0199999999995s)]
*  And so that book I'm trying to read, [[01:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4404.5s)]
*  The Atomic Habits is like, that guy talks about habits [[01:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4406.34s)]
*  and you know, it's like, you gotta just do these things. [[01:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4409.26s)]
*  He's very good at habits. [[01:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4411.78s)]
*  Like Mike gets up and does the same kind of thing [[01:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4413.5s)]
*  every morning. [[01:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4417.54s)]
*  I'm institutionalized. [[01:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4418.42s)]
*  Is it, yeah. [[01:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4419.22s)]
*  You gotta be institutionalized. [[01:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4420.06s)]
*  Yeah, that's, and that is something [[01:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4421.3s)]
*  that college does show you. [[01:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4423.46s)]
*  It's something that we don't have. [[01:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4424.7s)]
*  And it's hard for us too as comics [[01:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4425.78s)]
*  because you kind of have a freedom of, [[01:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4427.18s)]
*  like there's no one really telling us what to do. [[01:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4429.7s)]
*  There's not a boss. [[01:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4431.78s)]
*  We don't have a, you know, someone watching us. [[01:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4433.06s)]
*  So that's going like, you can't do that. [[01:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4436.22s)]
*  You could just quit this today. [[01:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4437.66s)]
*  And then just, no one's gonna. [[01:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4439.7s)]
*  No one's gonna call me and tell me to come back to work. [[01:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4441.5s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[01:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4443.3s)]
*  So when you don't have that, you just are kind of lost. [[01:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4444.14s)]
*  You gotta have it on your own. [[01:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4447.339999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4448.86s)]
*  It is hard to have. [[01:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4449.7s)]
*  It is hard to have. [[01:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4450.94s)]
*  But the amount of knowledge that we have now is like, [[01:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4451.78s)]
*  that's why I learn everything now. [[01:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4454.379999999999s)]
*  It's like through the internet, through podcasts [[01:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4455.74s)]
*  and through information. [[01:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4457.94s)]
*  Like I didn't know, I wish I would have known [[01:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4459.339999999999s)]
*  some of this stuff when I was like cutting weight [[01:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4460.86s)]
*  or training or whatever. [[01:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4462.74s)]
*  Like I didn't know like. [[01:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4465.0599999999995s)]
*  But you still gotta do it. [[01:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4467.0599999999995s)]
*  You still gotta do it, but the thing is like, [[01:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4468.419999999999s)]
*  I cut sugar. [[01:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4470.78s)]
*  That helped me a lot because everybody's body is different, [[01:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4472.0599999999995s)]
*  I guess, but mine was like, you have to cut sugar. [[01:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4474.94s)]
*  Really? [[01:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4477.299999999999s)]
*  Because it's hard at first, it's hard for like a week, [[01:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4478.139999999999s)]
*  week and a half, two weeks. [[01:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4480.46s)]
*  But once it's out of your, you realize it's like, [[01:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4481.62s)]
*  oh, this is what was addicting me. [[01:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4484.46s)]
*  That's why I had that, the feeling he was talking about, [[01:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4486.62s)]
*  which is it's uncontrollable. [[01:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4489.219999999999s)]
*  I gotta eat, I gotta gouge my. [[01:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4490.82s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[01:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4492.98s)]
*  I gotta eat, like overeat and stuff. [[01:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4493.82s)]
*  But that's what, it's like when I feel that now, [[01:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4495.78s)]
*  I go, oh, I've had too much sugar. [[01:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4498.099999999999s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[01:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4499.219999999999s)]
*  I mean, I'll have it nights and I'll have those little baby [[01:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4500.0599999999995s)]
*  buckets of Pringles. [[01:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4502.139999999999s)]
*  Have you had them? [[01:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4504.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4505.14s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[01:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4505.9800000000005s)]
*  Damn, they're good. [[01:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4506.820000000001s)]
*  Oh, it's the best. [[01:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4507.66s)]
*  I ate some the other day. [[01:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4508.5s)]
*  And they're so, there's just like eight or nine in there. [[01:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4510.42s)]
*  And you almost feel like it's a little family, [[01:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4513.06s)]
*  whatever, they're all sleeping in there when you open it. [[01:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4514.58s)]
*  You know, you feel like a big giant, like, [[01:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4516.42s)]
*  hey, stay asleep, I'm gonna eat you. [[01:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4518.22s)]

*  and they were, and they had Pringles there. [[01:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4527.34s)]
*  My daughter always eats Pringles. [[01:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4529.74s)]
*  But you think, oh, I'll just eat four. [[01:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4531.66s)]
*  And then I'll eat a couple more. [[01:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4534.9s)]
*  God, they're fucking good. [[01:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4536.34s)]
*  And then I start eating them two at a time. [[01:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4537.18s)]
*  And then you're just. [[01:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4538.42s)]

*  Go back up to the beginning. [[01:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4681.82s)]
*  What does it say, this guy? [[01:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4683.299999999999s)]
*  Altman is hoping to achieve the latter goal with the, [[01:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4684.9s)]
*  Altman has described emptying his bank account [[01:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4689.78s)]
*  to fund two particular goals, [[01:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4692.299999999999s)]
*  limitless energy through an investment, [[01:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4693.98s)]
*  the Fusion Power Startup, Helion Energy, [[01:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4697.299999999999s)]
*  and extending the lifespan. [[01:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4699.459999999999s)]
*  So he has $108 million. [[01:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4702.339999999999s)]
*  Right. [[01:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4704.219999999999s)]
*  God. [[01:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4705.9s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4706.74s)]
*  I'd call, I think I would just do your best [[01:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4708.7s)]
*  to live more in the time that you have [[01:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4712.42s)]
*  than try to get 10 more years. [[01:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4714.3s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[01:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4715.78s)]
*  Well, maybe it'll start at 10 more years and then 20 [[01:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4717.46s)]
*  and then build that way. [[01:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4719.66s)]
*  If he extends that and you're the fricking life God [[01:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4721.94s)]
*  and you're just granting years to people, [[01:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4724.5s)]
*  like you're out on the street and people run up [[01:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4726.46s)]
*  and like, I gotta finish an essay [[01:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4728.26s)]
*  and it's like, two more months. [[01:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4730.38s)]
*  He's just granting people something. [[01:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4732.5s)]
*  You know? [[01:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4734.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4735.14s)]
*  But go back to what I said about mice. [[01:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4735.9800000000005s)]
*  What was the thing about mice? [[01:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4737.42s)]
*  This is the part that I was trying to get to. [[01:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4738.46s)]
*  Extended lifespan, Altman's interest in extended lifespan [[01:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4742.1s)]
*  came from following discovery of young blood research, [[01:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4744.74s)]
*  which saw old and young mice being sewn together [[01:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4747.42s)]
*  so they shared a blood system. [[01:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4749.9400000000005s)]
*  The old mice seem to be partly rejuvenated [[01:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4752.5s)]
*  as a result of the experiment. [[01:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4754.66s)]
*  And after hearing of the apparent success, [[01:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4756.54s)]
*  Altman tasked his staff at the time [[01:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4758.14s)]
*  with looking into the progress being made [[01:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4759.7s)]
*  by anti-aging scientists. [[01:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4762.22s)]
*  So that's crazy. [[01:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4764.820000000001s)]
*  They basically sewed an old person and a young mouse [[01:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4765.66s)]
*  and a young mouse together. [[01:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4767.9400000000005s)]
*  And then the old- [[01:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4769.780000000001s)]
*  Sounds like a comedy movie. [[01:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4770.62s)]
*  The old one. [[01:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4771.9800000000005s)]
*  Yeah, it does, huh? [[01:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4772.820000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4773.66s)]
*  Now they have to figure it out. [[01:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4774.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4775.66s)]
*  So they go audition and he goes, [[01:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4777.38s)]
*  saw me the young mice. [[01:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4778.740000000001s)]
*  He goes, no, you're the old mice. [[01:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4779.58s)]
*  That's how you find out you're old in Hollywood. [[01:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4780.740000000001s)]
*  No, you're the old mice. [[01:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4782.860000000001s)]
*  Come on. [[01:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4783.860000000001s)]
*  I got a few good years left. [[01:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4785.38s)]
*  Then he takes out his moth cheese to eat some cheese. [[01:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4788.18s)]
*  He puts in his- [[01:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4790.58s)]
*  But is that what Magic Johnson has been, [[01:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4791.58s)]
*  he's been getting blood transfusions all these years. [[01:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4793.22s)]
*  He's very healthy. [[01:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4798.0199999999995s)]
*  So it's like, maybe that's what it is. [[01:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4798.86s)]
*  You're supposed to give blood more. [[01:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4801.46s)]
*  Do you even know that? [[01:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4804.0199999999995s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4804.86s)]
*  Someone told me, it was like with testosterone, [[01:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4805.82s)]
*  like if you get testosterone, [[01:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4809.74s)]
*  you're supposed to, you gotta give blood a lot. [[01:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4810.94s)]
*  But I think you're supposed to give blood a good bit. [[01:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4813.98s)]
*  Cause it helps you get more blood inside of you? [[01:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4816.98s)]
*  All right, yeah. [[01:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4818.9s)]
*  It's like, maybe I don't know anything [[01:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4819.74s)]
*  other than someone said that to me. [[01:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4821.46s)]
*  Are we supposed to donate blood? [[01:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4823.42s)]
*  Oh, here we go. [[01:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4824.66s)]
*  This other thing this guy said, plasma therapy. [[01:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4825.98s)]
*  So if you get young blood and put it in you, [[01:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4829.0199999999995s)]
*  maybe that's, oh yeah. [[01:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4831.3s)]
*  Young blood sounds like something [[01:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4832.5s)]
*  that brothers say to each other. [[01:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4833.34s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4834.54s)]
*  Some young blood. [[01:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4835.38s)]
*  I think they do say that to each other. [[01:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4836.219999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4837.0599999999995s)]
*  If you're in the gangs. [[01:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4838.34s)]
*  Is the gangs the new mafia? [[01:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4841.26s)]
*  The gangs? [[01:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4842.94s)]
*  The gangs would be- [[01:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4843.94s)]
*  The gangs are dangerous, man. [[01:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4844.9s)]
*  But the gangs are just dangerous. [[01:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4847.0199999999995s)]
*  Like, dude, I think if the Bloods or Crips [[01:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4849.22s)]
*  came out with merch, bro, they would crush. [[01:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4851.38s)]

*  They were involved in politics. [[01:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4975.219999999999s)]
*  So they had all that. [[01:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4977.86s)]
*  They would take the illegal money [[01:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=4979.099999999999s)]

*  And the big thing is, how did you die? [[01:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=5234.18s)]
*  If you died in your bed, that's a win. [[01:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=5236.9400000000005s)]
*  And not in prison or getting shot in the face. [[01:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=5238.9800000000005s)]
*  So Carlo Gambino, they say was a, [[01:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=5241.74s)]
*  he was the boss of the family for like 30 years [[01:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=5244.82s)]
*  and then died in his bed in like 1976. [[01:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=5248.14s)]
*  And there's a guy from Chicago [[01:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=5250.9400000000005s)]
*  I forget his name. [[01:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=5256.34s)]

*  to like the early 90s. [[01:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=5261.38s)]
*  And he died in his bed. [[01:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=5264.9400000000005s)]
*  And that guy might be the most successful. [[01:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=5267.34s)]
*  He might be the most successful. [[01:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=5270.38s)]
*  Because no one even really knew him. [[01:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=5271.22s)]
*  They knew him on the street, but they tried to drag him in. [[01:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=5273.42s)]
*  And if you could, I don't know what the guy's name, [[01:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=5276.42s)]
*  from, he's from Chicago. [[01:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=5279.5s)]
*  Look him up on the step. [[01:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=5281.3s)]
*  His nickname was the Big Tuna. [[01:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=5282.14s)]
*  The Big Tuna from Chicago. [[01:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=5283.860000000001s)]
*  Let's look him up. [[01:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=5286.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=5287.02s)]
*  And they tried, like they brought him in [[01:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=5287.860000000001s)]
*  for like a Senate judiciary. [[01:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=5288.9800000000005s)]
*  They subpoenaed him and they brought him in. [[01:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=5291.02s)]
*  Yeah. Tony Ocardo. [[01:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=5293.18s)]
*  There he is. [[01:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=5294.66s)]
*  Tony Ocardo. [[01:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=5295.5s)]
*  So they bring him in and he talks. [[01:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=5296.34s)]
*  And then they keep trying to bring him in, [[01:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=5297.18s)]
*  but he just, they can't get anything on him. [[01:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=5299.22s)]
*  So the last, his last hearing, it's actually very funny. [[01:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=5303.1s)]
*  I don't know if you could bring it up, [[01:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=5306.780000000001s)]
*  but the last hearing, it's like, he's like nine, [[01:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=5307.74s)]
*  he's like in his late 80s and they bring him in [[01:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=5310.14s)]
*  and they're just asking him questions. [[01:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=5313.46s)]
*  And he's so old that he can't hear half the questions. [[01:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=5315.54s)]
*  I watch it, I'm laughing. [[01:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=5318.299999999999s)]
*  It's on YouTube? [[01:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=5319.5s)]
*  Yeah, it's on YouTube. [[01:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=5320.339999999999s)]
*  But he like, it just shows you that he beat the system. [[01:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=5321.179999999999s)]
*  He spent like two days in prison his entire life. [[01:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=5324.139999999999s)]
*  And it's just, it's a fascinating thing to watch [[01:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=5328.379999999999s)]
*  that the guy is. [[01:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=5331.46s)]
*  There you go, right there. [[01:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=5333.259999999999s)]
*  Do you recall when that was taken? [[01:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=5335.179999999999s)]
*  No, sir. [[01:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=5336.74s)]
*  Do you recall what you were doing at that time? [[01:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=5337.98s)]
*  No, sir. [[01:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=5341.0199999999995s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=5342.339999999999s)]
*  You had a business meeting with Mr. Sarum? [[01:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=5343.18s)]
*  No, sir. [[01:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=5344.860000000001s)]
*  Good answers. [[01:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=5345.68s)]
*  And you're completely unaware of what he does for a living. [[01:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=5346.52s)]
*  No, sir. [[01:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=5349.66s)]
*  Outside of government. [[01:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=5351.42s)]
*  Outside of government. [[01:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=5352.58s)]
*  So they think this guy did stuff? [[01:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=5353.780000000001s)]
*  I mean, that guy was, from all like informants and stuff [[01:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=5355.34s)]
*  and like the FBI information, [[01:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=5359.18s)]
*  that guy was the head, like on the top. [[01:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=5361.780000000001s)]
*  Like he probably retired and was overseeing it. [[01:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=5364.3s)]
*  He had, what the Chicago bosses would do, [[01:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=5366.42s)]
*  and in some of the New York guys, [[01:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=5369.5s)]
*  they would have street bosses. [[01:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=5370.740000000001s)]
*  So the real power would, [[01:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=5372.26s)]
*  because too much heat, he would step back [[01:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=5373.54s)]
*  and then have a street boss take over. [[01:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=5375.900000000001s)]
*  That was like Sam Giancana and Joey Ayoopa, [[01:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=5377.5s)]
*  some of these other guys. [[01:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=5380.06s)]
*  And they ended up, like Sam Giancana ended up [[01:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=5381.14s)]
*  getting murdered in his home. [[01:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=5383.58s)]
*  But a lot of these guys, Ayoopa and Sarum, [[01:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=5385.34s)]
*  who they were talking about, [[01:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=5388.3s)]
*  ended up doing life sentences and never flipped. [[01:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=5389.66s)]
*  So they ended up doing life sentences [[01:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=5392.900000000001s)]
*  so they would put a street boss in place [[01:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=5394.54s)]
*  to run things from day-to-day operations. [[01:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=5396.72s)]
*  But like on big policy questions, [[01:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=5398.74s)]
*  like that guy would be consulted. [[01:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=5400.7s)]
*  But that guy was able to take his ego out of it. [[01:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=5402.9400000000005s)]
*  And that's what's safe. [[01:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=5404.22s)]
*  I mean, after a while, you have enough money [[01:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=5405.3s)]
*  to be like, what am I, you know, I have enough money. [[01:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=5406.740000000001s)]

*  I don't need the legal headaches. [[01:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=5410.26s)]
*  So I'll just step back and let somebody else run [[01:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=5411.900000000001s)]
*  and just consult. [[01:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=5415.26s)]
*  Did that guy probably have people killed and all that? [[01:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=5416.1s)]
*  I'm sure. [[01:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=5417.22s)]
*  Sam Giancana, like the only way Sam Giancana, [[01:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=5418.26s)]
*  who was the boss of the family, [[01:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=5420.54s)]
*  like for a while in the 60s and the 70s, [[01:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=5422.22s)]
*  for him to get killed had to be okayed by him. [[01:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=5426.320000000001s)]
*  It had to be okayed by him. [[01:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=5429.02s)]
*  There's nobody higher. [[01:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=5430.18s)]
*  Right. [[01:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=5431.1s)]
*  So it's pretty fascinating, the structure. [[01:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=5432.78s)]
*  Also, another thing that fascinated me [[01:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=5434.9s)]
*  is guys being walked into a room [[01:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=5436.66s)]
*  and they're not sure if they're gonna die or not. [[01:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=5438.62s)]
*  Oh, it'd be the worst. [[01:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=5441.98s)]
*  Like a wedding. [[01:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=5442.82s)]

*  Oh yeah, they have to because you're so scared [[01:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=5446.44s)]
*  and the in-laws paid for it. [[01:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=5448.7s)]
*  That's the fuck. [[01:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=5451.0599999999995s)]
*  That's how they get you. [[01:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=5451.9s)]
*  The wife's dad paid for it. [[01:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=5453.0199999999995s)]
*  That's why they pay for it. [[01:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=5454.0199999999995s)]
*  There's no old thing with trading a goat or whatever. [[01:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=5455.58s)]
*  It's because it's another linchpin [[01:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=5457.74s)]
*  for you to feel responsible to be there. [[01:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=5460.18s)]
*  God, that breaks my heart. [[01:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=5462.62s)]
*  It's really great. [[01:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=5463.9800000000005s)]
*  That's like when someone orders the appetizer [[01:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=5464.900000000001s)]
*  and you gotta eat it. [[01:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=5468.740000000001s)]
*  You go to a big Italian family and you gotta eat. [[01:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=5470.06s)]
*  She keeps bringing food out. [[01:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=5471.9800000000005s)]
*  You have to eat it to be polite. [[01:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=5473.06s)]
*  And that's what marriage is. [[01:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=5474.46s)]
*  You just try to be polite. [[01:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=5475.54s)]
*  Then they wheel out their daughter [[01:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=5477.42s)]
*  who's had a couple few too many apps as well [[01:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=5478.62s)]

*  It'd be better to not go. [[01:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=5873.72s)]
*  To not go, usually you go to, [[01:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=5874.76s)]
*  I mean, they used to go to the military. [[01:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=5876.4400000000005s)]
*  That was a thing. [[01:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=5878.360000000001s)]
*  They'd go to the military and then come out [[01:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=5879.2s)]
*  and then be able to like kill and stuff. [[01:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=5881.56s)]
*  Oh, because they're trained to kill. [[01:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=5885.8s)]
*  Do you guys think that we should have a separate [[01:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=5889.04s)]
*  gay and straight military ever? [[01:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=5891.0s)]
*  Like we should have an all gay military? [[01:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=5892.44s)]
*  Mm, no, it'd be colorful. [[01:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=5894.44s)]
*  I think it'd be cool almost. [[01:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=5897.0s)]
*  But I guess in the military, the people don't care. [[01:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=5898.24s)]
*  I don't ever hear any of my military friends [[01:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=5901.12s)]
*  saying there's any issues if people are gay [[01:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=5902.64s)]
*  or straight in the military. [[01:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=5904.12s)]
*  No, I don't think that matters. [[01:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=5904.96s)]
*  I've heard outsiders kind of have thoughts on it, [[01:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=5906.36s)]
*  but I've never heard anybody inside of it have thoughts on it. [[01:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=5908.4s)]

*  Yeah, that's true. [[01:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6203.96s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[01:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6204.92s)]
*  And then you're like, no, no, I'm not at all. [[01:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6205.96s)]
*  But it's like. [[01:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6207.84s)]
*  And he puts a napkin on his lap like this [[01:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6208.68s)]
*  before he eats even out of a takeout. [[01:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6210.6s)]
*  Yeah, they would say that at the meeting [[01:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6212.8s)]
*  when they were gonna kill you. [[01:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6214.4400000000005s)]
*  They were like, he puts a napkin on his lap. [[01:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6215.28s)]
*  What more proof do you need? [[01:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6217.6s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[01:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6218.92s)]
*  What, you think he's straight? [[01:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6222.76s)]
*  With a napkin on his lap? [[01:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6224.12s)]
*  Well, when they go and take them in the room to kill them, [[01:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6225.8s)]
*  do you even know what's happening or it's just. [[01:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6228.08s)]
*  No, but I think it's fascinating [[01:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6231.32s)]
*  these guys are walked to their meetings [[01:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6233.12s)]
*  and they're like, this might be it for me. [[01:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6234.44s)]
*  And they go anyway, they go. [[01:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6237.16s)]
*  Some guys knew they were, like the Donnie Brosco, [[01:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6239.24s)]
*  that movie, like the real story of that. [[01:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6241.4s)]
*  The one guy who he was very close to after it came out [[01:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6243.919999999999s)]
*  that he was a federal agent [[01:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6247.759999999999s)]
*  and they led a federal agent into the family. [[01:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6249.599999999999s)]
*  One of the guys responsible was called to a meeting [[01:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6251.36s)]
*  and knew he was getting it. [[01:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6253.4s)]
*  That's why in the movie he leaves his money [[01:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6254.839999999999s)]
*  and his jewelry in a drawer and leaves it half open [[01:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6256.679999999999s)]
*  because he knows he's not coming back. [[01:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6259.96s)]
*  Why is it half, just so someone knows to find it? [[01:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6261.719999999999s)]
*  Because there was a lot of pride. [[01:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6265.0s)]
*  Because they wouldn't have been able to open that drawer. [[01:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6266.0s)]
*  They would have just moved it and he goes, [[01:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6268.92s)]
*  now leave it open so people see it. [[01:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6270.32s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, I mean, I guess there is pride where, you know. [[01:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6273.96s)]
*  You'd almost go, you could say the fact that he went to this, [[01:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6277.0s)]
*  knowing he's going to die, [[01:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6280.48s)]
*  you almost could be like, then he should live. [[01:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6281.72s)]
*  Because there's no one more loyal than this guy. [[01:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6284.16s)]
*  Because he's coming. [[01:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6287.0s)]
*  Yeah, you go, we're about to get rid of our biggest asset [[01:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6288.28s)]
*  that truly just got taken. [[01:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6292.12s)]
*  We all got taken because this guy was a federal agent. [[01:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6293.48s)]
*  But he's willing to walk to his own death. [[01:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6298.12s)]
*  So why would you get rid of that guy? [[01:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6302.32s)]
*  That's a good point. [[01:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6304.16s)]
*  At that point, that guy has a lot of freaking pride and respect. [[01:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6305.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6307.839999999999s)]
*  Who's it for, we don't know. [[01:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6308.799999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6310.2s)]
*  That's the issue. [[01:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6311.5199999999995s)]
*  You got to sort that out at that point. [[01:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6312.36s)]
*  Yeah, because he could fight them off. [[01:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6313.5199999999995s)]
*  I mean, he could do, why would anybody not fight him? [[01:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6315.599999999999s)]
*  But I think there's a rule that you're not supposed to, [[01:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6317.96s)]
*  those meetings, like when you're called to a meeting like that, [[01:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6319.879999999999s)]
*  you're not supposed to come armed at all. [[01:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6321.84s)]
*  Yeah, but you just, yeah, I mean, they're not good. [[01:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6325.360000000001s)]
*  There's a lot of freaking weird levels of respect. [[01:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6328.88s)]
*  You go, why didn't you bring a gun? [[01:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6329.96s)]
*  He goes, because they said you can't. [[01:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6330.96s)]
*  You go, do they frisk you? [[01:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6332.84s)]
*  You go, they don't, they don't frisk you. [[01:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6333.68s)]
*  You're like, yeah, so just carry the gun. [[01:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6335.6s)]
*  And he goes, no, but you don't understand, [[01:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6337.4400000000005s)]
*  it's against the rules to carry the gun. [[01:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6339.4800000000005s)]
*  And you're like, all right. [[01:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6342.52s)]
*  Yeah, that's tough to walk in that. [[01:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6345.0s)]
*  And how many times you got to take him to a normal meeting [[01:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6346.64s)]
*  for him to not realize that the bad meeting is coming. [[01:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6349.96s)]
*  You know, the meeting where they're like, [[01:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6352.84s)]
*  so you have to be like, hey, we wanna kill this guy. [[01:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6353.92s)]
*  So let's invite him to two, three meetings [[01:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6356.52s)]
*  to let him know like it's normal. [[01:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6360.04s)]
*  And then the fourth one where, you know, [[01:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6361.8s)]
*  Vinny comes in with like Popeyes and he's got like, [[01:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6363.6s)]
*  he's like, what up? [[01:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6366.16s)]
*  Can't wait to have this meeting. [[01:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6367.56s)]
*  He's like, God, never saw this coming. [[01:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6368.400000000001s)]
*  Look at that, yigging from bad, bad. [[01:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6370.08s)]
*  He's singing a song, yeah. [[01:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6371.96s)]
*  That's great, he did. [[01:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6373.320000000001s)]
*  He's singing a song. [[01:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6374.64s)]
*  He's already had his fingers are greasy, [[01:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6375.68s)]
*  snuck in and out a couple fucking times. [[01:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6377.16s)]
*  Yeah, he feels comfortable going, [[01:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6378.56s)]
*  he's eating the fries before they get there. [[01:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6379.8s)]
*  This guy has no respect for any of it. [[01:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6381.4400000000005s)]
*  Dude, anybody who doesn't eat the fries before they get there, [[01:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6383.56s)]
*  I don't know if I fucking respect that meal, you know? [[01:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6386.120000000001s)]
*  That's a good last meal, Popeyes. [[01:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6388.72s)]
*  Is it? Popeyes chicken. [[01:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6390.4400000000005s)]
*  Yeah, you gotta go bad on your last meal. [[01:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6392.080000000001s)]
*  You gotta just be like bloating me up. [[01:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6393.88s)]
*  Yeah, I don't think I would do a... [[01:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6396.280000000001s)]
*  Steak is played out. [[01:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6398.6s)]
*  Steak is played out too. [[01:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6399.68s)]
*  I'm probably, for me, I might be going fast food. [[01:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6400.8s)]
*  I'm a fast food guy. [[01:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6403.56s)]
*  I think two Chick-fil-A sandwiches maybe. [[01:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6405.72s)]
*  Raising canes maybe. [[01:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6408.6s)]
*  I think I'm going with what I ate last night. [[01:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6409.84s)]
*  I eat my last meal pretty regularly. [[01:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6412.56s)]
*  Sonic? Yeah. [[01:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6414.16s)]
*  Just... [[01:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6415.0s)]
*  Yeah, it says the guy who just showed up back at his starting way. [[01:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6415.84s)]
*  His starting way, yeah. [[01:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6419.4s)]
*  I went before, after, back to before. [[01:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6420.4800000000005s)]
*  And yeah. [[01:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6422.88s)]
*  But that's a good question, like an electric chair. [[01:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6424.76s)]
*  You're getting the electric chair the next day. [[01:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6427.0s)]
*  They do give you a last meal, what is it? [[01:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6429.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6432.56s)]
*  Yeah, that is a good question, Mike. [[01:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6433.56s)]
*  I'll go... [[01:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6435.28s)]
*  That's... [[01:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6436.96s)]
*  I'm like, we don't answer it though. [[01:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6439.2s)]
*  I go with some ice cream and I don't know... [[01:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6441.24s)]
*  I go a lot of ice cream. [[01:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6443.28s)]
*  Yeah, I don't like that Dutch chocolate. [[01:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6444.28s)]
*  I like regular fucking chocolate. [[01:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6446.12s)]
*  Hershey's. [[01:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6447.48s)]
*  The Dutch shit is... [[01:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6448.24s)]
*  Like, I don't know the Dutch. [[01:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6449.64s)]
*  I don't know how they got this, how they won the thing or whatever, but... [[01:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6451.68s)]
*  I was just there, I did shows in Europe. [[01:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6455.32s)]
*  Did you really? [[01:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6456.96s)]
*  Yeah, and we had some, went to Belgium and Brussels and did some chocolate. [[01:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6457.8s)]
*  Yeah, it was, you know... [[01:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6463.04s)]
*  Sometimes it's like, our taste are just... [[01:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6464.88s)]
*  We need it to be processed. [[01:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6467.76s)]
*  Like, you're like... [[01:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6469.6s)]
*  You know, we have the taste... [[01:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6471.92s)]
*  I have the taste of just like poor South. [[01:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6472.92s)]
*  Like, you're like, I can't handle the real stuff. [[01:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6476.68s)]
*  You need it to be a little... [[01:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6479.68s)]
*  I love that in New York where it's like... [[01:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6481.32s)]
*  The government to be involved a little bit into my chocolate. [[01:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6482.84s)]
*  Because in New York, they go, that's a big thing now. [[01:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6485.4400000000005s)]
*  Is it processed? [[01:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6487.8s)]
*  Is that processed, what you're eating? [[01:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6488.64s)]
*  It's like, well, we live in Manhattan. [[01:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6489.76s)]
*  So, there's no farms here. [[01:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6491.56s)]
*  It's like, let's be honest, I'm guessing that this casserole [[01:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6495.6s)]
*  has been cut with baby powder. [[01:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6497.68s)]
*  Okay? [[01:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6499.2s)]
*  I could be realistic to her if I can eat in an alphabet city over here. [[01:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6500.04s)]
*  So, let's not lie to each other. [[01:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6504.4800000000005s)]
*  Did you like living in New York? [[01:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6507.96s)]
*  Yeah, I did like it. [[01:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6509.4800000000005s)]
*  I would go back, I think about sometimes trying to, [[01:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6510.320000000001s)]
*  you know, possibly doing something else. [[01:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6512.12s)]
*  Rogan's always asking me to move down to Austin, [[01:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6514.400000000001s)]
*  but sometimes I feel like there's so many people there already. [[01:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6516.56s)]
*  This is it, dude, here. [[01:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6519.16s)]
*  I'm a big Nashville fan. [[01:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6521.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6522.68s)]
*  Vanderbilt's doing a little better. [[01:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6523.92s)]
*  Vanderbilt's doing better. [[01:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6525.0s)]
*  We got a big game this week. [[01:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6525.84s)]
*  Vanderbilt's very exciting. [[01:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6526.76s)]
*  But I'm a big, we have a good comedy scene here. [[01:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6528.68s)]
*  I want Nashville to, a lot of comics to move here. [[01:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6532.72s)]
*  And I know a lot, but Rogan's doing great. [[01:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6535.040000000001s)]
*  And like, you know, he's got his new club. [[01:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6538.240000000001s)]
*  And Austin does have a great scene, [[01:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6539.72s)]
*  but I think we have a great scene. [[01:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6542.040000000001s)]
*  I'll tell you, I told Young, I talked about Young Comics [[01:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6543.360000000001s)]
*  about whether you have to move to New York now. [[01:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6546.280000000001s)]
*  I don't think you, when I started, it was, [[01:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6548.4800000000005s)]
*  we needed to be in New York. [[01:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6552.2s)]
*  I don't think you have to go to New York [[01:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6554.04s)]
*  like you did when we started. [[01:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6555.48s)]
*  I think you can easily move to Nashville. [[01:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6557.2s)]
*  I like Young Comics, I would like you to move to Nashville. [[01:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6560.0s)]
*  I want to build this, I hope this scene builds up. [[01:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6562.72s)]
*  But you can be here. [[01:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6565.5199999999995s)]
*  Austin's got a great scene. [[01:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6567.48s)]
*  You do not have to go to, I think, New York like you did. [[01:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6569.28s)]
*  I just, I really don't think you do. [[01:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6574.32s)]
*  Because it's, you're going up every night here. [[01:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6576.88s)]
*  Can you get up every night here, though? [[01:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6579.8s)]
*  I think if you, [[01:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6581.76s)]
*  Yeah, they can get up every night here. [[01:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6582.88s)]
*  And there's a lot of great comics here. [[01:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6584.92s)]
*  I agree, there's a lot of good comics. [[01:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6586.639999999999s)]
*  We have comics getting stuff out of here. [[01:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6588.5199999999995s)]
*  They had a girl that, she's writing for SNL, [[01:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6589.88s)]
*  I believe, was out of here. [[01:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6592.84s)]
*  Laura Peek, I believe, she opens for Louie. [[01:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6595.44s)]
*  She opens for me. [[01:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6598.2s)]
*  She opens for you, yeah. [[01:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6599.04s)]
*  She's from here. [[01:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6599.96s)]
*  She moved to New York, though. [[01:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6601.2s)]
*  But you could, I'm not saying you don't ever move, [[01:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6602.639999999999s)]
*  or nothing ever changes, [[01:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6606.08s)]
*  but I don't think when you start, I don't think you have to. [[01:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6607.639999999999s)]
*  I think you can get seen in other cities now. [[01:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6610.24s)]
*  Yeah, I agree. [[01:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6614.12s)]
*  I agree, I mean, things about Nashville that are great [[01:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6615.36s)]
*  are it's a small city. [[01:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6617.04s)]
*  It feels, I think it's definitely a good starter city as well [[01:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6619.28s)]
*  if you're considering moving to somewhere else bigger. [[01:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6623.0s)]
*  But you don't want to make a full jump to somewhere, [[01:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6625.2s)]
*  especially from a smaller place. [[01:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6627.24s)]
*  This is a great place. [[01:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6629.04s)]
*  And it's growing so fast. [[01:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6630.44s)]
*  I mean, in five years, it could be a huge city. [[01:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6631.96s)]
*  It could be a huge city. [[01:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6634.44s)]
*  I mean, it's growing. [[01:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6635.28s)]
*  I mean, things that were just built [[01:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6636.5599999999995s)]
*  are being torn down to build bigger things. [[01:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6638.28s)]
*  It's just unbelievable. [[01:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6640.76s)]
*  And you have a lot of friendly people here. [[01:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6642.5599999999995s)]
*  I know my neighbors here. [[01:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6644.639999999999s)]
*  I know people that live on my street. [[01:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6646.44s)]
*  It's like you have a lot of local support. [[01:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6648.08s)]
*  Those are some things that are great about it. [[01:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6652.76s)]
*  Yeah, we have the Nashville Comedy Festival's [[01:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6654.16s)]
*  a giant festival. [[01:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6656.0s)]
*  Yeah, you're in it. [[01:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6657.8s)]
*  Carlos, who else? [[01:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6659.16s)]
*  Carlos Miller, I think, is in it. [[01:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6661.08s)]
*  David Spade, are you in it, Mike? [[01:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6662.8s)]
*  Carlos Miller. [[01:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6664.5599999999995s)]
*  I don't know, last year, that's when we shot the special. [[01:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6665.8s)]
*  Nashville Comedy Festival, yeah. [[01:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6668.2s)]
*  Yeah, we did a special last year. [[01:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6670.12s)]
*  But yeah, Spade, I mean, it's a lot of big names. [[01:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6672.64s)]
*  So comedy's becoming a big thing. [[01:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6676.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6679.0s)]
*  Yeah, I would like it to become more. [[01:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6680.360000000001s)]
*  I think there'll probably a new club will pop up [[01:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6681.52s)]
*  at some point because of just the size [[01:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6683.4800000000005s)]
*  of the population growth. [[01:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6685.72s)]
*  Yeah, but there's so many other rooms, too. [[01:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6686.96s)]
*  But the good thing is Zanies does a very good thing [[01:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6689.280000000001s)]
*  with they do the new material night, [[01:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6691.76s)]
*  which has become, I mean, dude, [[01:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6693.68s)]
*  it's sold out. [[01:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6697.52s)]
*  And that's just a new material night. [[01:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6699.96s)]
*  And there's nights where you're gonna be there, [[01:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6701.4400000000005s)]
*  I go there, like, I mean, it's tonight, [[01:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6703.320000000001s)]
*  you're going tonight. [[01:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6706.320000000001s)]
*  Steve Byrne, Joe Gatto. [[01:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6707.4800000000005s)]
*  Yeah, so like a lot of, like, when you moved here, [[01:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6709.12s)]
*  that was a big deal. [[01:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6711.4400000000005s)]
*  Like it was a big deal for this scene, [[01:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6712.320000000001s)]
*  to just people recognize that there's a scene here. [[01:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6715.4800000000005s)]
*  And when Steve moved here, then Josh Wolf was here, [[01:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6719.2s)]
*  I think he'd left, but it was, you know, [[01:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6722.64s)]
*  they're coming here, people are coming here, [[01:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6726.0s)]
*  you get the club, Zanies is great. [[01:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6727.72s)]
*  Yep, Zanies is great. [[01:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6731.0s)]
*  And then they have the other rooms, [[01:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6731.84s)]
*  I think there's Third Coast, there's, [[01:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6733.360000000001s)]
*  I'm blanking on all the names. [[01:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6736.400000000001s)]
*  I need to go experience some of the other local rooms, too. [[01:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6737.84s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[01:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6740.160000000001s)]
*  I think that's one way where I'm personally missing out [[01:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6741.0s)]
*  and not going and doing that as much. [[01:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6742.68s)]
*  Yeah, they're great. [[01:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6744.56s)]
*  You get to a level where you've done it so much, [[01:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6746.240000000001s)]
*  like you were saying earlier about Mike, [[01:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6748.360000000001s)]
*  is just having done a lot of that road work, [[01:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6750.040000000001s)]
*  that really was kind of a different time. [[01:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6752.200000000001s)]
*  I remember 40 weeks a year, I'd be doing [[01:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6754.88s)]
*  the three or four day weekends. [[01:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6758.4400000000005s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6760.360000000001s)]
*  For seven, eight years. [[01:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6761.200000000001s)]
*  Yeah, but I think that's kind of the route of, [[01:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6762.68s)]
*  becoming a great comic now is a little bit of that route, [[01:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6768.68s)]
*  like you can book yourself or you can do, [[01:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6771.76s)]
*  I mean, look, it's hard, [[01:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6775.68s)]
*  because you always think I wouldn't want to start now, [[01:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6777.280000000001s)]
*  like what comics have to go through. [[01:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6779.56s)]
*  But I already started, so it's hard for me [[01:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6782.88s)]
*  to mentally open my mind to go start over. [[01:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6784.92s)]
*  So comics coming up now, [[01:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6789.28s)]
*  they're having to really create their own kind of ways. [[01:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6790.68s)]
*  But it's like being out, being out on the road. [[01:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6794.16s)]
*  I mean, look at like a Shane Gillis, [[01:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6796.28s)]
*  Shane is someone that, when I first saw Shane, [[01:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6798.88s)]
*  it was like, I remember, when I first saw him, [[01:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6802.88s)]
*  I remember just, I was like, man, this dude is like, [[01:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6805.0s)]
*  it's something else, like this guy, [[01:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6807.12s)]
*  you just don't see that a lot where you're. [[01:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6809.52s)]
*  He's like the best fart. [[01:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6812.32s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[01:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6813.5599999999995s)]
*  So, but he goes. [[01:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6815.48s)]
*  I mean that in the best way, he's like the fucking most, [[01:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6816.32s)]
*  he's like. [[01:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6818.84s)]
*  But he's on the road. [[01:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6820.48s)]
*  Does that make any sense, saying that about him? [[01:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6821.32s)]
*  Yeah, I think so. [[01:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6822.88s)]
*  Yeah, I think so. [[01:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6823.72s)]
*  He's the most pungent. [[01:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6824.5599999999995s)]
*  No, he just like, it's like the best pitch, [[01:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6825.8s)]
*  that his whole, it's like. [[01:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6828.08s)]
*  It's everything. [[01:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6829.2s)]
*  And he told me about the best fart, [[01:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6830.04s)]
*  maybe he said he was in private school [[01:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6831.36s)]
*  and they would have class in church, [[01:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6834.0s)]
*  and sometimes somebody would fart in the pews [[01:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6836.8s)]
*  in an empty church. [[01:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6839.5199999999995s)]
*  And it was, he still will stop and laugh [[01:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6841.5199999999995s)]
*  about the sound of it. [[01:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6843.599999999999s)]
*  Is that solid? [[01:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6844.44s)]
*  Yeah, it's like, hey God, what about this, you know? [[01:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6845.28s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[01:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6848.28s)]
*  So I still, even it makes me laugh hearing about it, [[01:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6849.2s)]
*  so I can only imagine being firsthand on a fart like that. [[01:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6851.5199999999995s)]
*  Yeah, God, just straight off the wood, fucking, you know. [[01:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6855.679999999999s)]
*  It's the dude with the Ryman, the Ryman has the. [[01:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6858.639999999999s)]
*  The Ryman has the perfect seating for something like that. [[01:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6860.44s)]
*  They should have a contest over there. [[01:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6862.879999999999s)]
*  I mean, yeah, they could hold it. [[01:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6864.4s)]
*  It'd probably diminish, diminish. [[01:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6865.719999999999s)]
*  Diminish, it's a big one. [[01:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6868.04s)]
*  Might diminish the legacy of the Ryman, [[01:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6869.24s)]
*  but there's a big fart at church. [[01:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6873.5599999999995s)]
*  ["The Rhyman"] [[01:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6876.24s)]
*  ["The Rhyman"] [[01:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6889.0s)]
*  Oh. [[01:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6891.04s)]
*  Wow. [[01:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6892.04s)]
*  I mean, that was crazy. [[01:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6894.32s)]
*  That almost sounded fake. [[01:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6895.639999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6896.639999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6897.599999999999s)]
*  I mean, that's insane. [[01:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6898.48s)]
*  What does that mean? [[01:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6900.28s)]
*  What do God thinks when that happens? [[01:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6901.12s)]
*  I think that sounds like a mortal sin to me. [[01:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6901.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6904.16s)]
*  A big one. [[01:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6905.0s)]
*  It sounded like if it was done on purpose, [[01:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6905.839999999999s)]
*  if it was a little old lady that couldn't help it, you know, [[01:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6906.96s)]
*  but that sounds like it was done on purpose. [[01:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6910.599999999999s)]
*  It sounds like the devil pressing that button [[01:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6913.36s)]
*  at like the club that's like, brr, brr. [[01:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6915.16s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[01:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6916.879999999999s)]
*  Yeah, those kids are videoing, [[01:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6918.599999999999s)]
*  like those kids went into that church and. [[01:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6920.12s)]
*  They planned that. [[01:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6922.4s)]
*  Yeah, they found an old church [[01:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6923.24s)]
*  and they found a place to go do it. [[01:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6924.879999999999s)]
*  And they sat right. [[01:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6926.4s)]
*  There's a lot of that. [[01:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6927.24s)]
*  I'm just saying it's like that kind of stuff. [[01:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6928.6s)]
*  Right, this guy could probably sell. [[01:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6929.44s)]
*  Setting up. [[01:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6930.28s)]
*  Yeah, this guy could sell 200 tickets somewhere. [[01:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6931.12s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[01:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6932.28s)]
*  There's. [[01:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6933.36s)]
*  For atheists. [[01:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6934.2s)]
*  Right. [[01:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6935.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6935.96s)]
*  But he rolls out there and he brings a small bench out there [[01:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6937.2s)]
*  and he goes out there and he gases up on the bench. [[01:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6940.84s)]
*  And we were all in the clubs, like suckers for years. [[01:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6944.28s)]
*  And we could have just been doing church farts. [[01:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6946.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6949.2s)]
*  But the longevity of it, that's the thing. [[01:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6950.04s)]
*  That's the longevity, dude. [[01:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6951.64s)]
*  You can get people to come and see you one time. [[01:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6952.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6954.32s)]
*  But if you don't give them something. [[01:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6955.16s)]
*  They're not gonna come back. [[01:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6956.84s)]
*  That's what Mike's special. [[01:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6958.320000000001s)]
*  Putting that out. [[01:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6959.96s)]
*  You're gonna be able to go watch this special [[01:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6961.400000000001s)]
*  and it's great and you're gonna watch them [[01:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6963.200000000001s)]
*  and it's gonna be a new hour [[01:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6964.76s)]
*  and then it's gonna be an amazing show [[01:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6965.8s)]
*  and you're seeing an act. [[01:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6969.400000000001s)]
*  That's the whole thing that I wanna build with this. [[01:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6970.76s)]
*  It's not saying I have anything, [[01:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6975.16s)]
*  but it's just presenting comics and stuff [[01:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6976.280000000001s)]
*  to be like we're presenting a full act. [[01:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6979.4400000000005s)]
*  So when you go watch this and you buy a ticket to a show, [[01:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6982.360000000001s)]
*  then you go see it live. [[01:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6986.56s)]
*  You are seeing an act. [[01:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6987.76s)]
*  You're seeing a proper show versus, [[01:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6988.96s)]
*  yeah, you can have videos where these people [[01:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6992.280000000001s)]
*  can sell those tickets and then you're like, [[01:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6994.080000000001s)]
*  they can't go do a full show. [[01:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6996.040000000001s)]
*  It's hard to learn how to do a full show. [[01:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=6998.400000000001s)]
*  That's sometimes, you know, like America's Got Talent, [[01:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7000.6s)]
*  like when they would do stuff like that, [[01:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7003.240000000001s)]
*  then they'd give them a year at Vegas. [[01:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7004.240000000001s)]
*  You're like, some of these people [[01:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7006.6s)]
*  are like they've been doing this for six years. [[01:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7008.4400000000005s)]
*  Yeah, they have five minutes. [[01:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7011.92s)]
*  And you're like, they can't go do an hour, [[01:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7012.76s)]
*  like a full on show. [[01:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7014.96s)]
*  He's like gargling like Jessie's Girl or something. [[01:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7016.64s)]
*  You're like, that dude can't do an hour. [[01:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7019.08s)]
*  They can't do a, there's no show. [[01:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7021.2s)]
*  But then you have like the Terry Fader [[01:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7023.360000000001s)]
*  or whatever the guy's name. [[01:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7025.2s)]
*  Like that guy won that, [[01:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7027.0s)]
*  but like that guy was doing the thing for 20, 30 years. [[01:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7028.16s)]
*  Yeah, he was doing it for a long time. [[01:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7031.4800000000005s)]
*  So then he goes and ends up signing a giant deal. [[01:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7033.08s)]
*  I think he died actually, but he was, yeah. [[01:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7036.76s)]
*  I do think he's dead. [[01:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7040.16s)]
*  Maybe he's not dead. [[01:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7041.72s)]
*  Dude, everybody's dead, man. [[01:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7043.04s)]
*  Everybody's dead. [[01:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7044.12s)]
*  Nine out of 10. [[01:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7045.04s)]
*  Everybody's dead, but then also no one's dying. [[01:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7045.88s)]
*  You ever think that there are, [[01:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7048.24s)]
*  our most famous people that have been famous [[01:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7050.08s)]
*  our whole life, Tom Cruise, Tom Hanks. [[01:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7051.84s)]
*  These people are just still making the same, like. [[01:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7054.24s)]
*  I think it's Scientology is what you're talking about. [[01:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7057.2s)]
*  That's true. [[01:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7059.4s)]
*  That's a good point. [[01:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7060.24s)]
*  I think I would get sucked into something. [[01:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7061.08s)]
*  If I ever got near that world, they probably just, [[01:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7062.0s)]
*  you're gonna just be like, what? [[01:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7065.28s)]
*  You would go clear fast. [[01:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7066.72s)]
*  You just don't, I think if they're good talkers, [[01:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7067.72s)]
*  you're gonna be in. [[01:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7070.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7070.96s)]
*  I got cleared at the airport. [[01:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7072.2s)]
*  That's not, that has nothing to do with Scientology, huh? [[01:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7073.12s)]
*  That's not like a recitering thing. [[01:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7075.6s)]
*  Oh, clear. [[01:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7076.4400000000005s)]
*  It's probably the gateway. [[01:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7077.28s)]
*  I think they. [[01:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7078.12s)]
*  It's very similar, cause you're in the train stations [[01:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7078.96s)]
*  at then, and New York, they get you with that little thing. [[01:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7080.400000000001s)]
*  Like come and put the buzzer on you, [[01:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7083.0s)]
*  see if God wants you or whatever. [[01:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7084.2s)]
*  You know what I'm talking about? [[01:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7085.92s)]

*  You want this book? [[01:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7090.66s)]
*  Check the buzzer game or whatever. [[01:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7091.5s)]
*  And they put evil or whatever on there. [[01:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7093.400000000001s)]
*  Oh, I've never seen it. [[01:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7095.64s)]
*  Yeah, and then they invite you to the church, yeah. [[01:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7096.4800000000005s)]
*  Well, I thought that's if you were already struggling, [[01:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7099.08s)]
*  you're in it, then they hook something up to you [[01:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7101.24s)]
*  to see what your vibration is or something, [[01:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7103.08s)]
*  and that's like particle and clear. [[01:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7106.12s)]
*  Like are you, I don't know. [[01:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7108.36s)]

*  Oh, really? [[01:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7115.0s)]
*  One time, yeah. [[01:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7115.84s)]
*  And they sit you down and next thing you know, [[01:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7116.66s)]
*  they're inviting you over to the church. [[01:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7118.34s)]
*  I remember being in New York, man. [[01:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7120.84s)]
*  Dude, first time in New York, [[01:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7123.6s)]

*  and they invited me over for some, [[01:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7128.92s)]
*  I guess, I didn't know if it was gonna be sex [[01:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7130.68s)]
*  or what it was, right? [[01:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7132.52s)]
*  And so we get up to their apartment [[01:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7134.4800000000005s)]
*  and there were lesbian women. [[01:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7136.72s)]
*  And so they start, and I'm like nervous [[01:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7139.360000000001s)]
*  and everybody was doing a little bit of coke, you know? [[01:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7143.320000000001s)]
*  And I was doing it. [[01:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7146.400000000001s)]
*  And so everybody's doing a little bit of coke and that, [[01:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7147.96s)]
*  and they start making out and just showing tit [[01:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7152.120000000001s)]
*  and all of that, and I'm just like all excited. [[01:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7156.280000000001s)]
*  And I don't know if the cops are gonna bust in, [[01:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7158.6s)]
*  I don't know if this is legal, I don't know what's, [[01:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7160.120000000001s)]
*  it felt like a lot at once, you know what I mean? [[01:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7162.24s)]
*  My first night in New York City ever in my whole life. [[01:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7164.4s)]
*  And you've only heard about New York City, you know? [[01:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7167.52s)]

*  trying my best anyway. [[01:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7177.88s)]
*  And I think because of the drugs and the nerves, [[01:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7179.04s)]
*  I couldn't get erection. [[01:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7181.32s)]
*  So next thing you know, I'm like, I gotta get out of here. [[01:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7183.08s)]
*  This is just, it feels a little hot in here, right? [[01:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7186.4s)]
*  Because I didn't know if they were gonna mug me. [[01:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7189.16s)]
*  I just didn't know what was going on. [[01:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7190.6s)]
*  I didn't believe this could really be happening. [[01:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7192.6s)]
*  And then so I was like, I gotta grab something [[01:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7195.360000000001s)]

*  and then I get over to, then I went and stopped [[02:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7225.84s)]
*  in one of those bodegas or something, [[02:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7228.400000000001s)]

*  You're like, yeah, but you don't, is there not, [[02:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7344.96s)]
*  is there no one else? [[02:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7347.8s)]
*  They might've even been supporting someone, we think. [[02:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7350.24s)]
*  Yeah, like they were watching someone's baby. [[02:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7352.88s)]
*  No, no, they were like, they had like their brother, [[02:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7354.5199999999995s)]
*  their nephews in the game. [[02:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7357.2s)]
*  But still, you're like, you don't have an aunt [[02:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7360.36s)]
*  that's not going? [[02:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7362.24s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, back in the old days, [[02:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7363.88s)]
*  we'd be like, don't bring the baby down [[02:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7364.92s)]
*  by the train or whatever. [[02:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7365.96s)]
*  You know, that'd be like the only thing that, [[02:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7367.72s)]
*  it's like, times are just so different now. [[02:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7369.6s)]
*  I don't think women left the house [[02:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7372.36s)]
*  like the first year back in the day, though. [[02:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7373.6s)]
*  Now it's like women are like, I wanna be out, [[02:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7376.24s)]
*  I wanna be working by Thursday. [[02:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7378.12s)]
*  And it's like, what the fuck are you talking about? [[02:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7379.68s)]
*  You do see that where you can see people like, [[02:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7381.64s)]
*  I had a baby two days ago. [[02:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7384.2s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah, and they're just out. [[02:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7385.72s)]
*  And she's, yeah, they're back at work. [[02:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7388.0s)]
*  They have like the kids like in a little jar, [[02:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7389.28s)]
*  like one of those like kindergarten potato growing things. [[02:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7391.2s)]
*  And you're like, Jesus, [[02:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7394.96s)]
*  just a couple of fucking toothpicks coming out of it, [[02:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7396.28s)]
*  keeping it healthy. [[02:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7398.32s)]
*  Yeah, we could eventually get to where people [[02:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7399.68s)]
*  just go take a little longer lunch break [[02:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7401.5599999999995s)]
*  and come back with a baby. [[02:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7403.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7405.32s)]
*  They just, it's that quick. [[02:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7406.68s)]
*  They just pop it out and then. [[02:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7408.48s)]
*  Well, I think we're in the last times [[02:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7410.32s)]
*  where you will see people, [[02:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7411.88s)]
*  women actually carrying the child. [[02:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7412.96s)]
*  I think we're so close to the children all being in a center [[02:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7414.5199999999995s)]
*  and you go there, you do the sperm and do the egg. [[02:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7419.56s)]
*  And then you get that, you go back [[02:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7424.56s)]
*  and you go visit the baby and you see it, [[02:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7425.96s)]
*  but you get it when it's full, when it's ready. [[02:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7428.040000000001s)]
*  Wow, raised by a center. [[02:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7430.6s)]
*  I totally think that. [[02:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7432.240000000001s)]
*  It seems like it almost seems, [[02:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7433.360000000001s)]
*  if you look at a woman carrying something like that [[02:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7435.4400000000005s)]
*  and you're like, well, I think it's beautiful [[02:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7437.52s)]
*  and I think it's the way to do it. [[02:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7439.400000000001s)]
*  I think it's so close to that being. [[02:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7441.080000000001s)]
*  That is crazy. [[02:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7443.8s)]
*  It could be. Seeming old fashioned. [[02:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7444.64s)]
*  Yeah, I think it would be a mistake [[02:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7445.84s)]
*  because I think that's one of the most beautiful things [[02:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7448.12s)]
*  about being a mother and something that you have [[02:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7451.8s)]
*  that nothing can take is the fact that you're carrying [[02:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7454.96s)]
*  a child and the bond that a child and a mother has [[02:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7457.32s)]
*  is something that's, you can't even really describe it. [[02:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7460.4s)]
*  It's something bigger than, it's a miracle. [[02:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7466.2s)]
*  It's all that. [[02:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7471.84s)]
*  But it's like, that is true. [[02:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7472.88s)]
*  You could probably get to a point [[02:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7474.5199999999995s)]
*  where you're not having to have the baby. [[02:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7475.84s)]
*  Because I mean, they need to account [[02:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7479.84s)]
*  for touch and eye contact. [[02:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7481.32s)]
*  Yeah, but when the baby's born, then they do it. [[02:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7483.360000000001s)]
*  But I think- You don't leave it in there. [[02:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7485.4400000000005s)]
*  Yeah, you can't leave it in there. [[02:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7486.84s)]
*  If you leave it in there a couple weeks late, [[02:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7487.68s)]
*  they're gonna fucking fine you or whatever. [[02:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7488.84s)]
*  They're gonna come bring it. [[02:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7490.24s)]
*  They would fine you. [[02:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7491.360000000001s)]
*  People are like, hey, your baby's looking around. [[02:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7492.2s)]
*  Hey. Yeah. [[02:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7494.04s)]
*  Hey, you don't pay the bill. [[02:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7495.28s)]
*  And they're like, hey, we got your baby. [[02:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7497.92s)]
*  It's four. [[02:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7500.0s)]
*  And you're like, oh. [[02:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7501.2s)]
*  It's like swimming in the water. [[02:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7503.04s)]
*  It's a library book, but you gotta, [[02:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7505.080000000001s)]
*  you're like, are you gonna come get it? [[02:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7507.200000000001s)]
*  You go, yeah, I'll get it. [[02:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7510.4400000000005s)]
*  I'll be down there. [[02:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7513.240000000001s)]
*  I'll be down there. [[02:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7514.080000000001s)]
*  I'm coming. [[02:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7514.92s)]
*  I'm coming. [[02:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7515.76s)]
*  I'm on my way. [[02:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7516.6s)]
*  And you're like, god, there you go. [[02:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7517.4400000000005s)]
*  Have this kid. [[02:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7518.26s)]
*  And you just gotta have a kid. [[02:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7519.1s)]
*  And you go down there, [[02:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7520.240000000001s)]
*  and there's like a special little procedure in a room [[02:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7521.080000000001s)]
*  where you get the kid, [[02:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7522.4800000000005s)]
*  that maybe like drag a cloth off of it like that. [[02:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7523.72s)]
*  Like, yeah. [[02:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7526.240000000001s)]
*  But it's standing up because it's so old now. [[02:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7527.080000000001s)]
*  And it just like unveils it. [[02:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7529.88s)]
*  And he's like, hello. [[02:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7531.72s)]
*  And he goes, you forgot about me. [[02:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7533.48s)]
*  He goes, I know. [[02:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7535.0s)]
*  I've just been so busy. [[02:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7536.599999999999s)]
*  Well, I was drunk one night, [[02:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7539.2s)]
*  and I thought, oh, let's go have a baby. [[02:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7540.24s)]
*  A baby. [[02:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7542.72s)]
*  Yeah, and then you gotta go get it. [[02:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7543.5599999999995s)]
*  Dude, that could eat. [[02:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7545.599999999999s)]
*  I just think it's getting to that point. [[02:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7546.44s)]
*  It could. [[02:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7548.36s)]
*  I never even thought about it, [[02:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7549.2s)]
*  but I could definitely see it. [[02:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7550.04s)]
*  Yeah, everything's just getting, [[02:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7551.68s)]
*  I mean, it's, we're advancing so fast, you know? [[02:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7552.84s)]
*  It's getting to the point where the mafia is now [[02:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7555.5199999999995s)]
*  a high school kid on TikTok, you know? [[02:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7557.5599999999995s)]
*  It's getting to the point too where it's like, [[02:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7560.0s)]
*  we just watch things, and then since people, [[02:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7562.599999999999s)]
*  I think imagination is kind of disappearing. [[02:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7565.4s)]
*  So all people are gonna start to do [[02:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7568.36s)]
*  is watch what they see on their phones. [[02:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7570.2s)]
*  Like, you even see, there's a lot of videos. [[02:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7572.48s)]
*  A lot of times it's like a black guy [[02:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7574.44s)]
*  beating up a kid at school or something, I feel like. [[02:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7575.96s)]
*  I don't know if you guys get those a lot, [[02:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7577.92s)]
*  but I get a lot of that. [[02:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7578.84s)]
*  Or it's like, you'll see a kid [[02:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7580.16s)]
*  beating up a kid at school, right? [[02:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7582.0s)]
*  And then other kids see that, right? [[02:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7583.88s)]
*  And so then it's like, you know that other kids [[02:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7586.08s)]
*  are gonna start to just do what they saw [[02:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7589.4s)]
*  in the video. [[02:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7592.92s)]
*  So now you have kids just beating up other kids [[02:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7593.76s)]
*  just so they can make a video [[02:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7595.16s)]
*  and read the comments of what people say, right? [[02:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7596.5199999999995s)]
*  It's almost like you're just recreating what we see. [[02:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7598.88s)]
*  So like, whatever you see, [[02:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7602.92s)]
*  since you don't have an imagination of your own, [[02:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7604.12s)]
*  since it's, I don't know, [[02:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7605.96s)]
*  does it make any sense what I'm saying? [[02:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7607.84s)]
*  Yeah, imagination is key, [[02:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7608.96s)]
*  but I think the thing is that social media [[02:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7610.32s)]
*  and all this stuff is killing people's imagination, [[02:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7612.24s)]
*  because it's, sitting there and just being bored is okay. [[02:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7615.0s)]
*  Being bored is okay. [[02:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7620.0s)]
*  That's what sparks your imagination. [[02:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7621.88s)]
*  You're forced to use your imagination [[02:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7623.68s)]
*  because you don't have any other stimulus. [[02:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7625.68s)]
*  But now we have access to all the stimulus, [[02:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7627.4s)]
*  so there's no need to sit there. [[02:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7629.76s)]
*  When you're bored, you think something is wrong. [[02:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7631.52s)]
*  When it's not wrong, it's okay. [[02:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7633.96s)]
*  You're supposed to be bored. [[02:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7635.48s)]
*  It's to work that muscle. [[02:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7637.2s)]
*  Like you're not having to work that muscle anymore. [[02:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7638.4s)]
*  Yeah, and it'll disappear over time right there. [[02:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7641.92s)]
*  Instagram's co-founder says the app has lost the soul. [[02:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7643.92s)]
*  Well, people are just posting videos. [[02:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7647.280000000001s)]
*  Like none of this stuff is, [[02:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7650.280000000001s)]
*  like says they're showing the ounce of your life that's fun. [[02:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7651.6s)]
*  Like the, you know, that's like, man, you feel depressed. [[02:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7655.88s)]
*  I can feel it with like, sometimes like following, [[02:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7658.8s)]
*  you know, we follow comics each other and stuff like that, [[02:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7661.4400000000005s)]
*  and you're seeing other comics do stuff, [[02:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7663.92s)]
*  and you're like, am I doing nothing, dude? [[02:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7665.400000000001s)]
*  Am I nowhere in my career? [[02:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7667.04s)]
*  Because I'm watching this person's like on TV [[02:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7668.64s)]
*  doing something, and then you, [[02:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7670.96s)]
*  once you realize that everything, [[02:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7673.56s)]
*  you gotta realize that like, no one's doing anything really, [[02:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7676.04s)]
*  even though we think we're all doing everything. [[02:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7680.48s)]
*  You're, it's either someone's really good at showing you [[02:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7682.6s)]
*  that they're doing, like they're good at showing you [[02:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7685.08s)]
*  that they're doing something, but it's, [[02:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7687.28s)]
*  because, but they're not, no one's doing it. [[02:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7689.5599999999995s)]
*  We're all just trying to get by and all trying to like, [[02:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7691.24s)]
*  do what we do and. [[02:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7694.0s)]
*  Yeah, everybody's just trying to get by. [[02:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7695.36s)]
*  Bring that back up. [[02:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7696.48s)]
*  Well, that's always, you have to remember that [[02:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7697.72s)]
*  at the root of all things. [[02:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7699.4s)]
*  Most people are just trying to get by. [[02:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7700.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7701.92s)]
*  Now their level or idea of what getting by is, [[02:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7702.8s)]
*  and sometimes it gets kinda greedy or, you know, [[02:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7705.24s)]
*  it can get. [[02:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7707.6s)]
*  Yeah, we all have those emotions, [[02:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7708.4400000000005s)]
*  and this taps into the worst part of human beings, I think. [[02:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7709.56s)]
*  Because it's, even when you're looking at your own stuff, [[02:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7713.04s)]
*  it brings up a sense of narcissism, [[02:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7715.280000000001s)]
*  like how many likes do I get? [[02:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7717.360000000001s)]
*  I want more likes. [[02:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7718.64s)]
*  And then you start scrolling and seeing other people's stuff [[02:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7719.56s)]
*  and that triggers jealousy, [[02:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7722.0s)]
*  and like, am I not doing as good? [[02:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7724.360000000001s)]
*  And that's why there's like so much depression [[02:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7726.12s)]
*  from this stuff, I think. [[02:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7729.04s)]
*  It's this fake connection. [[02:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7730.04s)]
*  Oh, with kids, for sure. [[02:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7731.96s)]
*  Oh, I can't even imagine. [[02:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7733.52s)]
*  For kids, for sure, but even for us, [[02:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7734.36s)]
*  like we didn't grow up with this. [[02:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7735.4s)]
*  I mean, it's bad for us. [[02:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7736.84s)]
*  If it's bad for us, [[02:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7738.32s)]
*  to have your brain develop on this is crazy, I think. [[02:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7739.76s)]
*  Well, that's a good question. [[02:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7743.4s)]
*  It's like, and this article says, [[02:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7744.68s)]
*  Instagram's co-founder isn't happy with the direction [[02:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7746.44s)]
*  the platform is taking, [[02:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7748.56s)]
*  claiming it has lost the soul of its original purpose. [[02:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7749.64s)]
*  Knowing in its initial launch in October 2010 [[02:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7755.68s)]
*  by Kevin Systrom and Mike Krieger, [[02:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7757.92s)]
*  the app grew massively and has gone from a space [[02:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7760.32s)]
*  for friends and families to share pictures of their day-to-day [[02:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7762.2s)]
*  on a feed to incorporating TikTok-style reels, [[02:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7765.04s)]
*  a stories feature similar to Snapchat, [[02:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7768.5599999999995s)]
*  and the ability to buy and sell products [[02:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7771.0s)]
*  using Instagram shopping. [[02:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7772.599999999999s)]
*  I mean, if you're raising a kid without this, [[02:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7775.36s)]
*  I don't know how you would do it, [[02:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7777.639999999999s)]
*  but it's tough with all the peer pressure and stuff. [[02:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7778.679999999999s)]
*  But if you could raise a kid without this, [[02:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7781.5599999999995s)]
*  like to read a book and to have some kind of like [[02:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7783.599999999999s)]
*  mental grit, [[02:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7788.28s)]
*  you're gonna be raising a superhuman. [[02:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7790.4800000000005s)]
*  Because everybody is gonna be on this. [[02:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7792.4400000000005s)]
*  So it's like, if you can raise a kid without that, [[02:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7794.04s)]
*  and we used to make fun of the Amish growing up [[02:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7796.08s)]
*  and everything, it's like they actually got it right, [[02:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7798.28s)]
*  I think, where it's like just extreme work. [[02:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7800.4800000000005s)]
*  Well, you're seeing how far they are now in life. [[02:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7803.96s)]
*  But they're all, I mean, the Amish is out there. [[02:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7807.4s)]
*  The Amish is like running, like they're, [[02:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7809.4800000000005s)]
*  I'm joking with you on the Amish. [[02:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7811.96s)]
*  But it's like, it's funny, [[02:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7813.96s)]
*  I mean, look, they're obviously doing it right. [[02:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7816.32s)]
*  You're like, I mean, they're, [[02:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7817.84s)]
*  I don't know where they're at. [[02:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7820.08s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I just bought one of those space heaters [[02:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7820.92s)]
*  from one of them. [[02:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7823.28s)]
*  Yeah, that's nice. [[02:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7824.12s)]
*  They do sell a lot of those heaters online. [[02:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7825.08s)]
*  They're unbelievably at woodwork and stuff. [[02:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7827.56s)]
*  I remember what, before I moved to New York, [[02:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7829.68s)]
*  I was doing some marble installation. [[02:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7831.6s)]
*  It was like a part-time thing, [[02:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7834.56s)]
*  and this was a real beautiful house, wealthy. [[02:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7835.68s)]
*  And we were putting, me and another guy putting the marble [[02:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7839.28s)]
*  in and we were watching these Amish were doing the woodwork [[02:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7843.24s)]
*  and they were just killing it. [[02:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7845.68s)]
*  Well, that's what I noticed, yes. [[02:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7848.12s)]
*  I noticed in Europe, going to Europe was they just, [[02:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7850.2s)]
*  everything's so old there and the buildings [[02:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7854.12s)]
*  and it just feels, it's awesome. [[02:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7857.12s)]
*  And it's like, they're, because everything started, [[02:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7859.96s)]
*  so it's all, it's been there for, [[02:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7864.599999999999s)]
*  since you go to a building, it's like a thousand, [[02:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7866.24s)]
*  it's from 1,000. [[02:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7868.12s)]
*  And it's just, the culture like feeds into that. [[02:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7869.92s)]
*  Like, there's like a tradition that's held [[02:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7875.4800000000005s)]
*  because it's so old that these families are like, [[02:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7879.64s)]
*  you got a grant, like you have just such great tradition. [[02:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7883.32s)]
*  And I don't think we have that. [[02:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7887.04s)]
*  Like, it's kind of like, traditions, [[02:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7890.32s)]
*  there's not a lot of tradition here. [[02:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7892.6s)]
*  And I'm not saying it's a bad, like, [[02:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7894.04s)]
*  it's just a different kind of thing. [[02:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7896.32s)]
*  It's not. [[02:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7898.4400000000005s)]
*  But you were saying earlier, it's like, it's a reflection. [[02:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7899.28s)]
*  It's a reminder of what a young country we are. [[02:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7900.52s)]
*  Oh, we were, yeah. [[02:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7903.04s)]
*  Super young. [[02:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7904.04s)]
*  And we react in a lot of ways like a young country. [[02:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7904.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7908.12s)]
*  Yeah, and also I think we became the leader so quick before, [[02:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7909.32s)]
*  or hypothetical leader, if some people would say like, [[02:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7912.16s)]
*  just because of like the capitalism, the gross GDP [[02:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7914.68s)]
*  or whatever, like we became a leader so fast that- [[02:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7917.56s)]
*  But we're losing some of that, [[02:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7920.84s)]
*  well, the tradition of stuff, like- [[02:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7922.36s)]
*  Oh, we've lost a lot of tradition fast. [[02:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7924.76s)]
*  The thing that we had was family. [[02:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7925.6s)]
*  Right. [[02:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7927.32s)]
*  And the core family. [[02:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7928.16s)]
*  And that's the thing that you can see that they still, [[02:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7929.32s)]
*  they have so much of it because it's just been, [[02:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7934.4800000000005s)]
*  they've lived in the same place for 100 years. [[02:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7937.04s)]
*  Their family's been there forever. [[02:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7939.4400000000005s)]
*  And so our, is like, you're seeing, that's what made us, [[02:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7940.88s)]
*  I think, that was the reason we were so good. [[02:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7944.280000000001s)]
*  We had that. [[02:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7947.56s)]
*  We had such a big, strong family thing. [[02:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7948.400000000001s)]
*  And then immigrants would come here [[02:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7950.280000000001s)]
*  and then they would start in their family. [[02:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7951.96s)]
*  And- [[02:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7954.280000000001s)]
*  When you still see it in the immigrant communities, [[02:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7955.12s)]
*  I think like Mexican people, [[02:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7957.4400000000005s)]
*  I think there's still like a lot of big tradition [[02:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7958.6s)]
*  and a lot of Latino families. [[02:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7960.4800000000005s)]
*  Yeah, it's family. [[02:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7961.320000000001s)]
*  We do have that. [[02:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7962.160000000001s)]
*  We had it, but it's like, you gotta have family. [[02:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7963.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7965.72s)]
*  Family's what- [[02:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7966.56s)]
*  It'll help you keep tradition, I think. [[02:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7968.12s)]
*  Keep tradition, keeps your, yeah, it's like in Hispanic [[02:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7970.64s)]
*  or, it's like, all these different, [[02:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7974.24s)]
*  they really have the Jewish community. [[02:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7978.84s)]
*  It's all about their family. [[02:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7981.88s)]
*  It's all about, you do stuff because your grandparents [[02:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7983.16s)]
*  did it and you do it even properly. [[02:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7986.96s)]
*  We go to, what do you use people? [[02:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7989.64s)]
*  They have, what do they go to? [[02:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7993.4800000000005s)]
*  Temple. [[02:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7994.8s)]
*  Yeah, Temple. [[02:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7995.64s)]
*  Like they're doing that stuff where it's like we do it [[02:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7996.4800000000005s)]
*  because they wanna do it and all that. [[02:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7998.400000000001s)]
*  And it's like some of that is being lost. [[02:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=7999.92s)]
*  And it's like that's what you need. [[02:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8002.200000000001s)]
*  Well, in the immigrant community, it's great [[02:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8003.04s)]
*  because it's like they come to this country [[02:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8004.200000000001s)]
*  and they still got that here. [[02:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8007.12s)]
*  For the American dream. [[02:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8008.400000000001s)]
*  So the first generation always suffers because it's like, [[02:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8009.240000000001s)]
*  okay, now I'm gonna grit, I'm gonna grind it out. [[02:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8012.360000000001s)]
*  I'm gonna have four jobs. [[02:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8014.320000000001s)]
*  And then, as a result, they always preach education [[02:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8015.84s)]
*  to the next generation. [[02:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8019.88s)]
*  It's like, make sure you're educated. [[02:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8021.0s)]
*  You're gonna do better than I did. [[02:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8023.12s)]
*  And then the hope is that they get up and they do better. [[02:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8024.52s)]
*  But in that progression, like two, three generations, [[02:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8026.64s)]
*  some of that tradition does get lost inevitably. [[02:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8030.08s)]
*  So now you're this educated moneymaker [[02:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8032.96s)]
*  and you have all this wealth, but you've lost the tradition, [[02:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8035.52s)]
*  the work ethic that has got you there. [[02:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8039.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8041.52s)]
*  You're not passing that down to the next generation. [[02:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8042.360000000001s)]
*  The next generation feels entitled. [[02:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8045.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8047.16s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[02:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8048.0s)]
*  Like, I'm born into all this wealth. [[02:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8048.84s)]
*  You start to take it for granted [[02:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8050.56s)]
*  versus you're born gritty and poor. [[02:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8051.76s)]
*  And then you have to like, you have that mentality. [[02:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8054.88s)]
*  It's like, I'm gonna climb out of this. [[02:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8056.64s)]
*  Well, and I don't know if it's possible to teach that. [[02:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8058.24s)]
*  We had little Boosie on here [[02:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8059.68s)]
*  and we were talking with him about it. [[02:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8061.0s)]
*  And even like, coming up like in an impoverished, [[02:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8063.04s)]
*  he's a black rapper, right? [[02:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8065.32s)]
*  I'm coming up like in an impoverished area, Baton Rouge, [[02:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8066.68s)]
*  and like really from the streets type of vibe. [[02:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8069.32s)]
*  And he was saying he can't instill that to his children. [[02:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8072.48s)]
*  He said, he can't. [[02:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8075.28s)]
*  He just said there's something, [[02:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8076.719999999999s)]
*  and I don't know what type of family template [[02:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8079.44s)]
*  that they have for him, but he was saying, [[02:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8082.48s)]
*  man, it's hard to just get that next generation [[02:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8084.639999999999s)]
*  to go have the same mindset that you had. [[02:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8087.28s)]
*  I think it's also maybe just the cycle of how things work. [[02:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8090.24s)]
*  It's like, at a certain point somebody gets so wealthy [[02:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8092.719999999999s)]
*  and then the son is, the dad isn't there [[02:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8097.12s)]
*  to be a part of the son's life. [[02:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8099.36s)]
*  The son goes kind of crazy, inherits the wealth [[02:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8101.32s)]
*  and loses it all somehow. [[02:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8104.0s)]
*  And it all goes back into the pool. [[02:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8105.5599999999995s)]
*  I don't know if that's true, [[02:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8107.28s)]
*  but everything kind of has a cycle in a way. [[02:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8108.2s)]
*  But as a parent, I think that if you have wealth [[02:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8111.719999999999s)]
*  and you start raising a child, [[02:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8114.48s)]
*  you have to be conscious of the fact [[02:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8116.28s)]
*  that you're raising this child in wealth. [[02:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8118.12s)]
*  And everybody has this thing where it's like, [[02:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8120.08s)]
*  I want him to have, [[02:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8121.88s)]
*  I don't want him to have the struggles that I had. [[02:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8122.719999999999s)]
*  It's like, no, no, no, no. [[02:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8124.08s)]
*  The struggles made you who you are. [[02:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8124.96s)]
*  So it's important that even if you have wealth, [[02:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8127.2s)]
*  that you don't make it too easy [[02:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8129.719999999999s)]
*  and that they encounter some resistance. [[02:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8131.68s)]
*  Because resistance, that's what makes you strong. [[02:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8132.96s)]
*  Yeah, draw a dick on his back, [[02:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8135.44s)]
*  see if he can hide it from mom, you know? [[02:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8136.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8138.24s)]
*  We hide my daughter's breakfast every morning. [[02:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8139.16s)]
*  Fuck yeah. [[02:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8141.96s)]
*  Make her find it. [[02:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8142.8s)]
*  Sometimes she doesn't eat. [[02:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8143.68s)]
*  Happy Easter. [[02:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8145.0s)]
*  Happy Easter. [[02:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8145.84s)]
*  That's it. [[02:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8146.68s)]
*  Yeah, that's it. [[02:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8147.5199999999995s)]
*  Every morning's Easter. [[02:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8149.0s)]
*  Yeah, then you better get out of here. [[02:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8150.4s)]
*  I then give her $400. [[02:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8152.12s)]
*  So you have a balance [[02:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8154.48s)]
*  that you don't know you're doing it right. [[02:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8155.96s)]
*  You go, yeah, she has like 50 grand right now. [[02:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8158.44s)]
*  That's because I've been doing it all more [[02:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8160.96s)]
*  ever since she was a baby. [[02:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8161.72s)]
*  But you go, but that's right, she'll be fine, right? [[02:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8163.360000000001s)]
*  It'd be great. [[02:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8166.120000000001s)]
*  She can't find breakfast. [[02:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8166.96s)]
*  She just orders it out on your phone. [[02:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8167.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8169.120000000001s)]
*  In delivery. [[02:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8169.96s)]
*  Well. [[02:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8170.8s)]
*  Wealth on a shelf. [[02:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8171.64s)]
*  Yeah, I think you have to have that. [[02:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8172.4800000000005s)]
*  You gotta have like an obsession. [[02:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8174.8s)]
*  Like, or especially if they have some, [[02:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8176.64s)]
*  you can find something to be like, [[02:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8179.4800000000005s)]
*  go find an obsession [[02:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8180.76s)]
*  and then go try to become good in that field [[02:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8182.320000000001s)]
*  or whatever it is. [[02:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8184.92s)]
*  Because then you at least can have the grind [[02:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8185.96s)]
*  of like, you gotta start from the bottom in something. [[02:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8188.56s)]
*  Especially for someone that would come from, [[02:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8191.52s)]
*  that has like a ton of money or something. [[02:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8194.44s)]
*  You're like, well go, you know, [[02:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8196.960000000001s)]
*  go learn how to become successful in that field [[02:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8199.2s)]
*  where like the parent can't help you. [[02:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8203.76s)]
*  Yeah, right. [[02:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8205.960000000001s)]
*  It's like then, [[02:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8207.08s)]
*  because then if you let the kid just keep quitting [[02:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8207.92s)]
*  and go, well, they're not gonna let me do that. [[02:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8210.4s)]
*  He goes, all right, well, the dad can't force him to the top. [[02:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8211.84s)]
*  So you're like, all right, [[02:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8214.960000000001s)]
*  well then go try this thing over here. [[02:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8215.78s)]
*  So you gotta be like, no, no, no, [[02:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8217.6s)]
*  if you love that, then go build up through that world. [[02:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8218.880000000001s)]
*  But then there's that thing where it's like, [[02:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8221.960000000001s)]
*  well, I don't love it anymore [[02:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8223.0s)]
*  and I don't wanna do what I don't love. [[02:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8224.08s)]
*  It's like, no, you have to, [[02:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8225.400000000001s)]
*  you have to create the ability to overcome adversity. [[02:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8227.560000000001s)]
*  That's the big thing. [[02:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8230.0s)]
*  You have to, overcoming adversity is huge. [[02:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8231.08s)]
*  And if you have too many options, [[02:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8233.960000000001s)]
*  if you have the option to quit everything, [[02:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8235.6s)]
*  then you're not gonna be able to, [[02:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8237.2s)]
*  you have to weather that initial adversity. [[02:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8239.2s)]
*  And it hurts, it hurts to like to fail and to lose. [[02:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8240.84s)]
*  So, you have to be able to overcome that. [[02:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8244.480000000001s)]
*  That's interesting, man. [[02:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8247.880000000001s)]
*  I bet it would be a lot tougher to be a parent of a, [[02:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8248.720000000001s)]
*  in some ways, I mean, that's insane for me [[02:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8252.460000000001s)]
*  to really say that, but I bet in some ways it's tough. [[02:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8254.4s)]
*  It's also tough to be a parent if you're wealthy. [[02:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8257.880000000001s)]
*  Yeah, that's a real struggle. [[02:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8259.84s)]
*  That's a real struggle, [[02:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8261.44s)]
*  because your instinct is to make things easier [[02:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8262.26s)]
*  and it's wrong. [[02:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8264.4s)]
*  There's a guy, David Krantz, [[02:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8265.6s)]
*  I think his name is Krantz, can you look him up? [[02:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8266.880000000001s)]
*  He is a therapist that just works with [[02:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8270.04s)]
*  wealth and families and how it, [[02:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8274.480000000001s)]
*  because it's a big problem apparently in those families. [[02:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8276.16s)]
*  I used to teach kids with behavioral and emotional problems. [[02:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8278.92s)]
*  Oh, hell, BDLD? [[02:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8281.640000000001s)]
*  Yeah. Hell yeah. [[02:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8283.24s)]
*  Behavior disabled, learning disabled? [[02:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8285.640000000001s)]
*  Yeah, behavioral, behavioral and learning. [[02:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8287.04s)]
*  Praise God, baby. [[02:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8290.16s)]
*  And I taught in a city school, [[02:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8291.16s)]
*  I taught in a private, [[02:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8293.4s)]
*  kids get thrown out of Philadelphia schools, [[02:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8296.08s)]
*  which was a residential school. [[02:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8298.08s)]
*  So that was pretty wild, [[02:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8300.4s)]
*  because we'd have to like physically restrain the kids [[02:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8301.4s)]
*  if they would get out of hand. [[02:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8303.4s)]
*  And then I taught in a city public school [[02:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8304.52s)]
*  and then a working class district, [[02:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8307.08s)]
*  and then a wealthy. [[02:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8308.8s)]
*  And the wealthy one was really challenging, [[02:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8310.4s)]
*  because the parents were lawyers and doctors [[02:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8313.4s)]
*  and all this stuff, [[02:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8316.9s)]
*  and they didn't have the common sense to kind of, [[02:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8317.74s)]
*  a lot of them, a lot of them did, [[02:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8321.64s)]
*  but some of them didn't have the common sense. [[02:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8322.88s)]
*  And one guy was a psychologist, [[02:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8324.56s)]
*  and his kid was out of control, [[02:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8327.72s)]
*  and he refused just to discipline him, [[02:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8329.12s)]
*  like with just standard discipline tactics, [[02:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8333.88s)]
*  and the kid was out of control. [[02:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8335.8s)]
*  And he had other psychologists on the phone, [[02:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8336.84s)]
*  and we had this, [[02:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8339.6s)]
*  I was sitting around an IEP meeting, [[02:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8340.56s)]
*  which is what you have with these kids, [[02:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8342.28s)]
*  and all these different professionals, [[02:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8343.76s)]
*  counselor, I was the teacher, [[02:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8344.96s)]
*  you'd have the assistant principal, [[02:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8346.68s)]
*  you had therapists and stuff in there, [[02:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8348.32s)]
*  and it was just, [[02:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8350.48s)]
*  the guy was like, [[02:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8351.8s)]
*  I'm like, there's a million dollars worth of salaries [[02:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8352.64s)]
*  in here right now trying to figure out [[02:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8355.24s)]
*  what this kid needs, [[02:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8357.960000000001s)]
*  it's just the most basic discipline. [[02:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8358.8s)]
*  And he refused to, [[02:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8360.56s)]
*  he thought he could intellectualize his way out of it. [[02:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8362.44s)]
*  Oh, we can think our way out of this, [[02:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8365.4s)]
*  it's like, no, no, no, just discipline him. [[02:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8367.36s)]
*  But you discipline him, be like, look, I love you, [[02:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8370.36s)]
*  you tell him why, you discipline him. [[02:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8372.36s)]
*  It's like, I love you, this is why this is happening. [[02:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8373.88s)]
*  Because in the future, you're gonna be better from it. [[02:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8376.24s)]
*  What did the kid have, anything? [[02:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8378.68s)]
*  Oh, I mean, he's diagnosed with ADHD and all this stuff, [[02:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8380.84s)]
*  but he was just, [[02:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8383.8s)]
*  the kid was just breaking rules [[02:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8385.68s)]
*  and doing it because he could get away with it. [[02:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8387.22s)]
*  And instead of going, hey dude, you can't do that anymore, [[02:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8389.34s)]
*  this is what's gonna happen, [[02:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8392.06s)]
*  instead of just being very direct with him, [[02:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8393.179999999998s)]
*  he's like, well, is there some kind of a behavioral plan [[02:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8394.74s)]
*  that we can get into place? [[02:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8398.06s)]
*  It's like, you just, when he does something wrong, [[02:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8398.9s)]
*  you gotta discipline him. [[02:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8401.779999999999s)]
*  Yeah, honestly, it'd be like, [[02:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8403.099999999999s)]
*  if you wanna give this kid a chance, [[02:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8404.9s)]
*  you would just be like, you gotta hit him or something. [[02:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8406.099999999999s)]
*  How close were you to say that? [[02:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8409.46s)]
*  Because I don't think, [[02:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8411.019999999999s)]
*  I don't think like, [[02:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8412.42s)]
*  You gotta say that sometimes. [[02:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8413.939999999999s)]
*  Hitting is like, if you do things the right way, [[02:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8415.06s)]
*  I'd say 98% of the time, [[02:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8417.74s)]
*  I mean, you're gonna get 2% knuckleheads [[02:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8419.98s)]
*  where you might have to have some kind of physical, [[02:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8421.699999999999s)]
*  but if you're raising the kid correctly from the beginning, [[02:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8424.58s)]
*  there's a good chance that you're, [[02:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8427.779999999999s)]
*  and you're just implementing consistent discipline, [[02:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8429.539999999999s)]
*  you won't have to do that. [[02:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8432.22s)]
*  Damn, yeah. [[02:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8433.26s)]
*  Can you, do you ever think about being excited [[02:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8434.98s)]
*  about hitting, spanking your kids in the future? [[02:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8437.1s)]
*  You don't have any children now. [[02:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8438.9s)]
*  I don't have kids. [[02:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8439.98s)]
*  You ever think about it, how you're gonna do it, [[02:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8440.859999999999s)]
*  where you're gonna do it? [[02:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8442.26s)]
*  He's gonna be so old, so. [[02:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8443.660000000002s)]
*  Yeah, they'll be like, your dad. [[02:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8445.140000000001s)]
*  They'll turn on me. [[02:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8446.980000000001s)]
*  Was it your dad? [[02:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8447.820000000002s)]
*  He was 70 when I was born, yeah. [[02:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8448.660000000002s)]
*  Wow. [[02:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8449.7s)]
*  You'll be like, yeah, you could be my dad. [[02:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8450.54s)]
*  You can have some of his old shirts. [[02:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8452.18s)]
*  Yeah, that's great. [[02:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8453.78s)]
*  I don't have any. [[02:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8454.62s)]
*  His fucking piece of shit, other children, took them all. [[02:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8455.460000000001s)]
*  We'll get, but we could probably find one. [[02:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8457.7s)]
*  But we'll get a voltage on him. [[02:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8459.02s)]
*  But you have 20, and we have a little time [[02:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8459.86s)]
*  before we get to that point. [[02:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8461.980000000001s)]
*  That's true. [[02:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8463.1s)]
*  So we're eventually, we're finding the shirts. [[02:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8463.94s)]
*  Do you, was it hard to edit the special [[02:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8465.86s)]
*  when you guys were kinda putting it together? [[02:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8467.94s)]
*  Was that, did you guys have to pick and choose some stuff? [[02:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8469.300000000001s)]
*  Was everything pretty clear? [[02:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8471.58s)]
*  He did a lot of stuff. [[02:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8473.62s)]
*  He did everything. [[02:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8474.900000000001s)]
*  I did everything that I could do. [[02:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8476.94s)]
*  I mean, everything that you, yeah, so. [[02:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8477.78s)]
*  I could think of, cause I wanted all, I figure, you know, [[02:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8479.660000000002s)]
*  you know, shoot long, and then you could just edit it. [[02:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8482.26s)]
*  But yeah, I went through editing for a long time. [[02:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8485.900000000001s)]
*  So yeah, I did, was real meticulous about editing it. [[02:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8488.380000000001s)]
*  And did you help with that, Nate, [[02:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8492.1s)]
*  or what does that look like? [[02:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8493.26s)]
*  Yeah, I was in on it. [[02:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8494.1s)]
*  I mean, he did it, and then Ben Rosenfeld. [[02:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8494.94s)]
*  Ben Rosenfeld, who's a friend of mine, a comedian. [[02:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8498.140000000001s)]
*  And he helped me with it. [[02:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8500.900000000001s)]
*  He helped me with a couple of my albums too. [[02:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8502.740000000002s)]
*  So this, he brought an eye into it, [[02:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8504.34s)]
*  and also just, we sat down and just went through. [[02:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8507.380000000001s)]
*  It's good to have someone, you know, [[02:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8509.18s)]
*  when you have to edit your own stuff, it's very hard. [[02:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8511.18s)]
*  Like, it's like, you get tired of watching it. [[02:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8513.820000000002s)]
*  It's good to have, like, I would, [[02:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8516.300000000001s)]
*  I've always done every special that I've done. [[02:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8517.78s)]
*  I've sent it to another com, Justice Smith, [[02:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8520.42s)]
*  I just sent it to him. [[02:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8523.1s)]
*  Brian Bates, I sent to like, to Tennessee. [[02:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8524.300000000001s)]
*  All my Netflix, I would send to someone else. [[02:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8526.34s)]
*  Cause you're like, I can't, you know. [[02:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8529.140000000001s)]
*  Someone that knows your act, [[02:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8531.02s)]
*  cause it's like, it's just so hard to sit there and, [[02:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8533.62s)]
*  you're too in. [[02:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8537.380000000001s)]
*  Yeah, after a while you don't know if you're being objective. [[02:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8538.82s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8541.300000000001s)]
*  And after watching it so many times, like, [[02:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8542.140000000001s)]
*  is this even good anymore? [[02:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8543.380000000001s)]
*  I don't even know what this is. [[02:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8545.460000000001s)]
*  So it's like, somebody's like, no, no, you know, [[02:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8547.060000000001s)]
*  they can be objective a little bit. [[02:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8549.26s)]
*  And you almost start to hate it sometimes, [[02:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8551.66s)]
*  a little bit too, cause you just watch it so much. [[02:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8553.220000000001s)]
*  You don't feel like it doesn't have the same punch. [[02:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8555.42s)]
*  One day you watch it and your attitude isn't the best, [[02:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8557.460000000001s)]
*  you're in a weird mood. [[02:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8559.86s)]
*  And I'll attach that to things quick sometimes. [[02:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8561.18s)]
*  Yeah, it's very hard to do it. [[02:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8563.78s)]
*  And then, but yeah, we went through the whole process. [[02:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8567.380000000001s)]
*  I mean, I did it with, [[02:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8570.140000000001s)]
*  I partnered with 800 Pound Guerrilla too. [[02:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8570.980000000001s)]
*  And so they were part of this. [[02:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8573.02s)]
*  And so they got a great, great team. [[02:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8574.94s)]
*  And so then they were sending it over [[02:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8577.62s)]
*  and just going back and forth. [[02:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8579.26s)]
*  And he's going through the editing a lot. [[02:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8581.54s)]
*  I mean, a lot of that was, I'm letting him decide, you know, [[02:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8582.900000000001s)]
*  like I would go look at it then, [[02:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8587.54s)]
*  but it's like, you know, you can feel what, [[02:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8588.58s)]
*  he's going to know more than me and what to take out. [[02:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8591.1s)]
*  And what, you know, but we took out, [[02:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8595.42s)]
*  but the way we started a different, [[02:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8597.22s)]
*  like we did some stuff that was, you know, [[02:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8599.14s)]
*  it's like the beginning of it, [[02:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8601.58s)]
*  I wanted to get right into it. [[02:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8605.02s)]
*  So we have a little kind of an opening thing, [[02:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8606.18s)]
*  but it's all about trying to get into the special quick, [[02:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8608.22s)]
*  hitting jokes. [[02:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8610.9s)]
*  I have a joke that's just boom, right when you start, [[02:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8611.74s)]
*  it's like hitting it quick. [[02:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8614.02s)]
*  And then it's, I want to say 50 minutes, 53. [[02:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8615.740000000002s)]
*  53 minutes, so it's under an hour, like. [[02:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8620.900000000001s)]
*  Under an hour. [[02:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8622.980000000001s)]
*  Nice. [[02:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8623.94s)]
*  Which I think is a better way to, yeah. [[02:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8624.78s)]
*  I think it's a better way to go now. [[02:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8626.86s)]
*  Yeah, I don't know why people's attention spans [[02:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8628.54s)]
*  have to be an hour. [[02:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8629.86s)]
*  And especially you guys are doing it that way. [[02:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8630.94s)]
*  You could still then also take clips [[02:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8632.380000000001s)]
*  and put them out and put them together. [[02:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8633.980000000001s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[02:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8635.94s)]
*  There's a lot of material that we can pump out. [[02:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8637.1s)]
*  It's cool, man. [[02:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8640.140000000001s)]
*  And this your first special, Mike? [[02:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8640.980000000001s)]
*  No. [[02:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8642.02s)]
*  It's my first hour. [[02:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8642.86s)]
*  First hour, yeah. [[02:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8643.7s)]
*  I did two albums before this, [[02:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8645.66s)]
*  but I didn't shoot them. [[02:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8647.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8648.46s)]
*  A video, so. [[02:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8649.3s)]
*  So it's brand new. [[02:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8650.14s)]
*  I mean, all that material even then is, you know, [[02:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8650.98s)]
*  stuff that people will probably want to see as well, [[02:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8653.5s)]
*  or they'll go back to it. [[02:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8655.5s)]
*  Yeah, his album did really, really good. [[02:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8656.619999999999s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[02:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8658.98s)]
*  Yeah, like his. [[02:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8659.82s)]
*  The album before this? [[02:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8660.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8661.48s)]
*  Yeah, The Worst Kind of Thoughtful did well. [[02:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8662.32s)]
*  And, yeah. [[02:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8664.38s)]
*  What's that, The Eighth Harmony of the Gorilla, too? [[02:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8666.66s)]
*  No, that was, I did that independent. [[02:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8667.94s)]
*  Oh, it's good for you. [[02:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8669.539999999999s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[02:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8670.38s)]
*  But I'm really proud of this, [[02:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8671.38s)]
*  and the process has been great. [[02:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8672.619999999999s)]
*  And obviously I appreciate Nate bringing me in [[02:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8675.1s)]
*  and directing and all this stuff. [[02:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8679.06s)]
*  So it's, I'm really proud of it. [[02:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8680.86s)]
*  It's been a long road with this, [[02:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8683.98s)]
*  because I've been working on this. [[02:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8685.58s)]
*  Not just getting it together to shoot it, [[02:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8687.5s)]
*  but also the editing and all the other stuff. [[02:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8689.86s)]
*  It's been a long time. [[02:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8691.460000000001s)]
*  800 Pound has been great. [[02:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8692.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8693.5s)]
*  So I appreciate them, but I'm really proud of it. [[02:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8694.34s)]
*  Yeah, well it's a big deal for me to put something out [[02:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8696.78s)]
*  that Mike allowed me to be a part of it, [[02:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8700.3s)]
*  because Mike's that great of a comic. [[02:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8702.38s)]
*  So, and then it was just such a long process, [[02:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8705.22s)]
*  because then I had my special come out, [[02:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8707.179999999998s)]
*  and then it was like, [[02:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8708.58s)]
*  so it had to be pushed a little bit, [[02:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8709.5s)]
*  because it was like, [[02:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8712.099999999999s)]
*  mine was coming and we're trying to get, [[02:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8712.939999999999s)]
*  because my sense is going on my YouTube, [[02:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8714.42s)]
*  just if my YouTube bumps up after my special, [[02:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8716.22s)]
*  then it's just more better, it's better for him, [[02:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8720.539999999999s)]
*  and for these other specials. [[02:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8723.619999999999s)]
*  So yeah, it was a long process to do it, [[02:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8726.339999999998s)]
*  but yeah, it'll be March 24th. [[02:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8729.539999999999s)]
*  And what kind of stuff do we kind of get to know? [[02:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=8731.980000000001s)]

*  Yeah. [[02:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=9038.300000000001s)]
*  And they did it. [[02:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=9039.62s)]
*  Sometimes I wish I'd just navigated that time period better. [[02:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=9040.460000000001s)]
*  It was a hard time to navigate the whole pandemic. [[02:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=9042.74s)]
*  Yeah, you navigated it good. [[02:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=9045.02s)]

*  you know, the whole way it's like. [[02:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=9049.1s)]
*  I never wanted, I had to fix stuff. [[02:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=9051.5s)]
*  Cause I never wanted to, like, [[02:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=9053.539999999999s)]
*  I'm not telling someone to do something. [[02:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=9054.9s)]
*  Like I, you know, that's insane. [[02:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=9057.3s)]
*  But they would do that. [[02:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=9059.66s)]
*  But theaters would do that with, [[02:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=9060.74s)]
*  they would throw it on us. [[02:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=9063.14s)]
*  They would say the artist wants the people to be vaccinated. [[02:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=9064.86s)]
*  And like, so I had a few places that I was like, [[02:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=9067.619999999999s)]
*  no, no, no, no, no. [[02:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=9070.02s)]
*  Don't say I'm asking people to be vaccinated. [[02:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=9071.22s)]
*  Like you want people to, like you, [[02:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=9073.38s)]
*  the city might want to, or the venue might want to, [[02:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=9075.66s)]
*  but they would word it cause no one wanted to be the bad guy. [[02:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=9079.22s)]
*  The venue didn't want to be the bad guy. [[02:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=9082.099999999999s)]
*  So they, but the venue wanted it, [[02:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=9084.34s)]
*  but they would just throw it on the artists. [[02:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=9087.98s)]
*  So they'd be like, Theo is saying everybody needs to be, [[02:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=9089.779999999999s)]
*  you're like, Theo ain't telling people to do that. [[02:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=9092.74s)]
*  You're telling people, but you're wording it like it's Theo. [[02:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=9094.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=9097.34s)]
*  And they would do it like that. [[02:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=9098.179999999998s)]
*  I would have, I had a couple of places that I was like, [[02:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=9099.300000000001s)]
*  yo, they got a word that like, I'm not saying anything. [[02:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=9102.02s)]
*  I'm not. [[02:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=9105.86s)]
*  Don't put it on me. [[02:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=9106.7s)]
*  You're the one that's suggesting. [[02:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=9108.380000000001s)]
*  Like, so if anybody's going to suggest it, [[02:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=9110.82s)]
*  it is like, it is what it is. [[02:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=9112.66s)]
*  Like people are still coming out, you know, [[02:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=9114.42s)]
*  but it is what it is. [[02:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=9117.78s)]
*  But put that on, you say it properly. [[02:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=9119.18s)]
*  Don't try to throw it. [[02:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=9121.74s)]
*  Cause they could just do that to us. [[02:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=9123.1s)]
*  It's like, if you want to come to my show, [[02:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=9124.94s)]
*  you need to be circumcised, male or female. [[02:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0j-MrgiWs8&t=9126.58s)]
