*  Today's guest is that blue-eyed bluegrass bad boy. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=0.0s)]
*  You know it. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=3.84s)]

*  Um, he has a new album renewal that is out now, wherever you stream music. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=7.18s)]
*  Uh, he's the pride of Michigan. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=12.3s)]
*  He just got back from the Grammys. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=14.56s)]
*  So I'm looking forward to, uh, just to get in it, know him. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=16.44s)]
*  Today's guest is Mr. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=20.8s)]
*  Billy Strings. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=22.06s)]
*  I'll sit and tell you my story. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=30.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=51.32s)]
*  Thanks for coming in, bro. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=51.519999999999996s)]
*  Appreciate it, man. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=53.519999999999996s)]
*  Thanks for all the wild music, dude. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=54.28s)]
*  No problem, man. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=57.400000000000006s)]
*  That's my pleasure. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=58.2s)]
*  Um, how was the Grammys? [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=60.0s)]
*  You went to the Grammys. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=62.24s)]
*  Yep. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=63.04s)]
*  No, it was great. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=63.64s)]
*  Um, I brought my mom and dad out there. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=64.52s)]
*  And did you get to take them last? [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=67.36s)]
*  I know you've been before. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=68.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=69.48s)]
*  Um, no, the last time I didn't bring my parents, but this time the record that I [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=70.2s)]
*  was nominated for was actually, well, I was nominated for three things, but the [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=75.84s)]
*  main one for me was this record that I made called Me and Dad, which is exactly [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=80.76s)]
*  what it sounds like as a record that I made with my dad, and he's the one that [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=86.03999999999999s)]
*  taught me how to play and taught me all about bluegrass and stuff and taught me [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=89.64s)]
*  how to wipe my ass and tie my shoes and everything. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=93.16s)]
*  So to kind of grow up and make a record with him was just a big deal, man. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=95.24s)]
*  It was, it was something that I've, it was like a bucket list thing for me for a [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=100.8s)]
*  long time, you know, um, like it had been weighing on you a little bit even. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=104.52s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=109.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=110.4s)]
*  Cause I've been on tour, like when I was 19, I hit the road and haven't stopped [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=110.56s)]
*  and, you know, I'm like 31 now and, um, you know, it was like, man, time just is [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=115.36s)]
*  slipping by and my dad's getting older and I need to make this record and then [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=121.47999999999999s)]
*  gigs just keep getting booked and it's like, well, when am I even going to make [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=125.72s)]
*  it? [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=128.4s)]
*  And so eventually I just went to my manager and said, yo, let's block off time. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=129.28s)]
*  I need to make a record with my dad. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=133.72s)]
*  Like he's getting older. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=135.2s)]
*  I'm getting old, you know, it's time. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=136.35999999999999s)]
*  Like we got to do this. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=138.64s)]
*  So we did it and it was awesome. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=139.64s)]
*  You know, we got nominated for a Grammy, brought my folks out there and [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=141.04s)]
*  you know, had them posted up at the sunset marquee and just like showed them a [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=145.35999999999999s)]
*  great time, you know? [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=150.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=151.2s)]
*  And, um, that had to feel pretty amazing just cause I think a lot of people want [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=151.68s)]
*  to have that moment where they kind of pay homage to the, to the, a family member, [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=156.35999999999999s)]
*  some somebody who's gotten them emotionally there sometimes, you know, [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=161.72s)]
*  it's everything to me. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=166.28s)]
*  My dad is just, I wouldn't, you know, I wouldn't know anything about bluegrass [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=167.35999999999999s)]
*  music and Doc Watson and all the stuff that I cut my teeth on and is the reason [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=172.56s)]
*  why I have a good life today and, you know, a career and everything. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=177.64000000000001s)]
*  It's all because of when I was a little kid, he was so inspiring, you know, he's [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=181.44s)]
*  just sitting around picking and he was like, everybody's kind of like we'd have [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=185.76000000000002s)]
*  parties and stuff and everybody would just be sitting around vibing and smoking [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=191.28s)]
*  a couple of joints, having a few beers. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=195.68s)]
*  And my dad would be playing until he's like red in the face and everybody's [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=197.12s)]
*  singing along. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=200.72s)]
*  Just, I was a little kid being like, damn, my dad's fucking cool as hell. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=201.92s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=205.44s)]
*  And I want to be like that when I grow up. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=206.04s)]
*  And so it was, I was a little shit already wanting to be a bluegrass musician. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=207.8s)]
*  So it's like, well, what I've always wanted to do. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=213.0s)]
*  So it's, you know, it's all because of him and bringing him out there and like [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=216.2s)]
*  walking on the red carpet with him and shit, you know, he's, he's small town, [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=219.84s)]

*  And that's, you know, I guess like what it really is, the Grammys and stuff is just being [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=711.44s)]
*  recognized by your peers, you know? [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=718.16s)]
*  And so it's a great honor, you know, but it's really nice to win. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=721.68s)]
*  Like I won one and it's, it's cool, but, um, it's not why we do it, you know? [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=726.16s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=732.2s)]

*  Yeah. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=735.04s)]
*  But Molly Tuttle's record and her band and what she's been doing, um, she's been [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=735.36s)]
*  working her ass off. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=741.6800000000001s)]

*  She's so good. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=744.44s)]
*  You're going to say some of these names because I, it's, I start thinking how I got to [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=745.24s)]
*  get into more new music and I'm just not getting enough of it. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=748.92s)]
*  Man, there's a lot of great bluegrass happening. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=751.28s)]
*  And I think there's like something happening right now where people are like getting back [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=753.44s)]
*  into bluegrass again or like, you know, banjo music and kind of hillbilly music. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=757.88s)]
*  Well, I think people are generally, I think there's a [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=762.84s)]
*  general feeling in the universe for me anyway. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=765.04s)]
*  I know it is that I want to get back to something that feels like, uh, less industrialized. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=767.1999999999999s)]
*  I want to get something back to something that feels a little bit more connected to [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=774.92s)]
*  something human inside of me. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=779.8s)]
*  Man, I think that it goes in circles almost. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=781.24s)]
*  Um, if you think about, I mean, back in the day, like, let's say in the [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=785.0s)]
*  fifties and early sixties and stuff, there was a time where blue moon of Kentucky was [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=794.68s)]
*  like the biggest song out. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=799.64s)]
*  Wow. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=801.08s)]
*  It was like, uh, you know, one of Morgan wall and songs or something. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=801.6s)]
*  It was like the biggest hit. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=807.88s)]
*  It was like Miley Cyrus flowers, blue moon of Kentucky. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=809.0s)]
*  Keep on shining. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=812.84s)]
*  There was a time where Bill Monroe's song was like the biggest song out. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=813.56s)]
*  You know, Elvis covered it. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=817.4s)]
*  That was on the B side to one of Elvis's first, you know, releases. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=818.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=823.8s)]
*  But, and then it's kind of like rock and roll came out, you know, and, and, and [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=825.0s)]
*  stuff started getting really electric drums, you know, all this stuff started happening. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=832.76s)]
*  And then in the sixties, there was like this sort of whole barefoot sort of hippie [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=838.88s)]
*  movement where people wanted to get organic and back to the earth again and play acoustic [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=842.3599999999999s)]
*  instruments and feel their feet on the grass. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=846.5999999999999s)]
*  You know, and then the seventies happened, which was just fucking, in my opinion, just [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=849.8399999999999s)]
*  one of the best eras of music. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=855.8s)]
*  Really? [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=857.8399999999999s)]
*  And everything, man, I feel like people were just making kickass records then. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=858.56s)]
*  I feel like the record sounded good. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=863.04s)]
*  The way they were recorded was just like the gear at that time was just killer. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=865.04s)]
*  And I don't know, there's something about when I go through my collection, the records [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=868.76s)]
*  from the seventies, like stand out as like, for one thing, people were, you know, when [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=873.92s)]
*  they were in the studio, they were like working hard. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=879.68s)]
*  Maybe they just had really good cocaine or something. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=882.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=884.2s)]
*  Oh, they probably did. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=884.64s)]
*  I mean, we can't even, it's sad. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=885.6s)]
*  Our kids can't even get good cocaine in this country anymore. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=887.4s)]
*  It's kind of fucked. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=889.68s)]
*  I know it's unbelievable. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=890.84s)]
*  It was a decent upper. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=891.84s)]
*  I mean, you'd have a trucker would get there. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=893.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=894.6s)]

*  I mean, I grew up in a small town. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=1018.04s)]
*  A lot of my homies were at that time. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=1021.12s)]
*  Like it was you had people stealing from their grandmas and shit, stealing their, [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=1023.24s)]

*  I mean, like I said, I grew up in a small town. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=1040.08s)]
*  I just never really had any rules. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=1042.6s)]

*  I own you. Maybe I've heard of it. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=1065.8s)]
*  Yeah. We look up the population of Muir, Michigan. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=1067.32s)]
*  And I own you was probably a slave town, I'm guessing, just by the name of it. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=1070.48s)]
*  It's a prison town. It is. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=1073.6s)]

*  I mean, I I did coke that night. [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=1259.4s)]
*  I was drinking wine, beer and liquor. [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=1262.28s)]
*  And it was just I didn't eat anything like for a day and a half. [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=1264.44s)]
*  And it was just crazy. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=1269.04s)]
*  So I woke up the next morning and I had the worst hangover ever. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=1269.92s)]
*  And I was like, oh, and we got in the van. [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=1276.24s)]
*  We had to drive like five hours to make it to the next gig, to get there by three [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=1277.96s)]
*  so we could load in soundcheck and play our gig. [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=1283.04s)]
*  But I thought I was good to go. [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=1286.08s)]
*  And then when I got in the van, I go, oh, hold up. [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=1288.08s)]
*  And I went and puked by the bushes or whatever. [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=1290.12s)]
*  Got back in the van. [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=1292.44s)]
*  Ten minutes later, I'm going off, fuck, pull over, you know. [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=1295.28s)]
*  And then every ten minutes for you know, it took us seven hours to drive the five [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=1298.08s)]
*  hour drive because I had to stop and puke. [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=1303.12s)]
*  We were late for loading and soundcheck. [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=1305.1999999999998s)]
*  We had to set up our gear in front of the audience. [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=1307.96s)]
*  All just hung over. [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=1310.12s)]
*  It was like embarrassing. [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=1311.8799999999999s)]
*  It was all because I was so drunk the night before. [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=1312.9199999999998s)]
*  And I was like, I'm never doing this again. [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=1314.76s)]
*  And I haven't drank since. [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=1316.4399999999998s)]
*  Well, they're probably weighed on something. [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=1317.8s)]
*  Yes. [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=1319.08s)]
*  Sometimes when there's a moment, I feel like for me anyway, I know. [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=1319.28s)]
*  And it just sounds like it like if there's a moment where you can get enough [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=1322.0s)]
*  reflection, where like it costs you something that means something to you, like in a [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=1325.96s)]
*  moment. [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=1330.76s)]
*  My career was just I could see it. [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=1331.24s)]
*  It's like, man, if I don't fuck this up, I could actually turn this into something. [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=1334.28s)]
*  Maybe it was like at the point where it's like, I shouldn't blow this, you know. [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=1337.76s)]
*  Dude, that's crazy because that kind of moment doesn't happen to a lot of people. [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=1342.72s)]
*  You know, where you just have that perfect thing where you're on stage, you're loading [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=1346.28s)]
*  and you're like, fuck, we're late. [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=1349.0s)]
*  It's because of me. [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=1350.56s)]
*  And it started as like, OK, I'm not drinking at least for the rest of the weekend. [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=1352.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=1357.48s)]
*  And then and then you know, shout out to everybody that's ever said that. [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=1358.6000000000001s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=1363.0s)]
*  It's like, I'm not OK, at least till next weekend or whatever, like till this baby's two. [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=1365.28s)]

*  Yeah. [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=1371.96s)]
*  And then so that turned into, well, I'm not drinking for the rest of the week. [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=1373.0s)]
*  And that turned into two weeks, months, two years. [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=1377.48s)]
*  Seven years. [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=1382.52s)]

*  Wow. [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=1384.68s)]
*  It's like now, you know what a big moment for me was when I realized how many times I had [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=1385.28s)]
*  slept in the hotel room with them little mini bottles in my fridge and I never even [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=1392.0s)]

*  Yeah. [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=1396.88s)]
*  One day I was in there and I reach in there to grab a Coke or something and I realized [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=1397.6000000000001s)]
*  that I was reaching right past a bottle of Jack Daniels and then I realized how many [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=1403.0s)]
*  other times I had done that before and then I never even fucking thought about it. [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=1406.68s)]
*  Well, I'm all alone in my hotel room right now. [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=1411.36s)]

*  It's like, wow, it's really kind of out of the back of my mind. [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=1419.6799999999998s)]
*  That's so good. [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=1423.8s)]
*  You know, and I think I think people people have started to evolve. [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=1424.9199999999998s)]
*  I was looking at a chart the other day that drinking has gone. [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=1431.32s)]
*  It's not as big on college campuses that it's just that drinking is kind of it started [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=1435.32s)]
*  to like dissipate or whatever the desire for. [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=1443.08s)]
*  As you go to college. [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=1446.1599999999999s)]

*  And that's the other thing, too, is like I never drank for. [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=1470.9199999999998s)]
*  You know, people drink wine and they drink these heady beers, these hoppy beers and [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=1475.6s)]
*  and everything and all. And it's like whispering hook. [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=1479.9599999999998s)]

*  There was a time where I played guitar for 48 hours straight and I didn't put it down. [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=1883.28s)]
*  I swear to God. And I played pretty much the same riff the entire time. [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=1888.72s)]
*  It was like I was just playing holding my guitar and my fingers were just going and I was just like, wow. [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=1892.32s)]
*  And it was like an orchestra was coming out. [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=1898.84s)]
*  It was like I was writing shit that I never could have imagined. [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=1900.96s)]
*  It was like a beautiful mind type situation. [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=1904.04s)]
*  Oh, my gosh, bro. And so is that just so that like and you feel like that was drug fueled or? [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=1908.12s)]
*  Oh, yeah, absolutely. I mean, so much so that I can't even sit here and say that I'll never smoke meth again, [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=1914.36s)]
*  because I might want to do it in a controlled environment as a creative experiment. [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=1920.96s)]
*  Yeah. You know what I mean? [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=1926.32s)]
*  Oh, yeah. Because, dude, I swear to God, I think I could write an album in three days. [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=1927.6s)]
*  That's like the craziest shit ever. [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=1931.28s)]
*  I don't, you know, obviously, I'm not like condoning it. [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=1933.28s)]
*  You know, like, it's fucking terrible. [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=1937.24s)]
*  Don't do it. But I am saying that that those 48 hours when I was playing guitar straight, it was like I worked some cobwebs out in my brain. [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=1939.4s)]
*  That was kind of crazy. And, dude, this was crazy. [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=1948.08s)]
*  So I'm sitting up stairs and this was the first time I ever smoked meth. [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=1950.32s)]
*  And I was 16 and I was upstairs. [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=1954.4s)]
*  I lived on Main Street. I was in the band. [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=1958.88s)]
*  My drummer, Carl, shout out Carl. [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=1960.88s)]
*  But in Jordan, these are my homies from these are my homies from back home, you know, but like. [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=1965.24s)]
*  And they passed away? [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=1975.08s)]
*  No, no, they're still around. [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=1976.2s)]
*  Okay. Yeah, my bad then. [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=1977.56s)]
*  I mean, Jordan almost fucking passed away. [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=1981.0s)]
*  He needs to fucking keep his nose clean. [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=1983.4s)]
*  God damn it. Yeah. [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=1985.36s)]
*  Amen. And so does everybody. [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=1987.1200000000001s)]
*  Yeah. But no, I lived in this house, bro, on Main Street, on Main Street in Ionia, which is [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=1988.68s)]
*  a tiny little town. [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=1993.64s)]
*  And there was this we were renting this place, right? [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=1995.24s)]
*  But there was renovations happening. [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=1998.44s)]
*  And I'm like, man, why is this guy coming over at fucking seven o'clock in the morning [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=2000.28s)]
*  and start banging on shit? It's fucking seven. [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=2003.52s)]
*  Sun's not even barely up yet. [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=2005.8400000000001s)]
*  So, you know, one of my buddies comes over who is a tweaker and figures out that this guy, [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=2007.6000000000001s)]
*  the handyman who's working on this house that we're renting is holding and is like, you know, [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=2015.2s)]
*  and I'm like, well, if you guys are going to smoke here at my house, [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=2020.8000000000002s)]

*  Well, it was like my parents were into it at the time, and I was like, [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=2030.6399999999999s)]
*  I want to know, like, what the hell's going on? [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=2034.24s)]
*  Oh, yeah, do some. Yeah, that makes sense. [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=2036.12s)]
*  If something. I mean, that's why I had my biological father died from a heroin overdose [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=2037.9199999999998s)]
*  when I was two years old. [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=2042.24s)]
*  That's why I had to do heroin. [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=2044.1599999999999s)]
*  It's like I had to. It was like what it was so good that took my dad from me. [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=2045.84s)]
*  Oh, man. So I had to figure it out. [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=2049.3199999999997s)]
*  And I met the Grim Reaper and shit. [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=2051.8s)]
*  He tapped me on the shoulder and was like, dude, it was like, man, we're jumping stories. [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=2053.88s)]
*  I got so many of them. But I didn't know this man. [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=2057.7200000000003s)]
*  Hey, I'm sorry to hear that, dude. [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=2060.76s)]
*  Makes me kind of breaks my heart. [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=2062.6800000000003s)]
*  But it's interesting that you. [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=2064.44s)]
*  I'm curious about one to try. [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=2067.88s)]
*  Yes, I finished the tweaking for 48 hours. [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=2069.84s)]
*  Yeah, let's start there, dude. Finish that. [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=2072.28s)]
*  I was upstairs. Yeah, a lot of people here are do home renovations. [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=2073.6800000000003s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=2078.0s)]
*  So this dude was he was working at all hours of the night and shit. [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=2080.0s)]
*  I'm like, what the fuck? [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=2082.7200000000003s)]
*  So, you know, my body figured I was tweaking and like, you know, [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=2083.8s)]
*  and they showed me how to they're like, you got a light bulb? [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=2087.52s)]
*  And I'm like, yeah. [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=2090.6s)]
*  And so they showed me how to take the little silver thing off the bulb. [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=2091.4s)]
*  And you can take it out and then you put some warm saltwater in there and swish it around. [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=2096.44s)]
*  You get all that white shit off the ball. [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=2099.68s)]
*  And you got a nice clear bulb. [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=2101.52s)]
*  So then you kind of just tap some shit down in there and you can burn it and smoke it. [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=2103.2400000000002s)]
*  So whatever. I hit the shit. [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=2106.6s)]
*  Whoa. All of a sudden, where's my guitar? [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=2108.92s)]
*  I want to play guitar so bad. [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=2111.1600000000003s)]
*  So for two days, I sat there and playing two fucking days. [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=2112.44s)]
*  I don't I didn't eat. I don't even think I pissed. [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=2116.56s)]
*  It was insane. [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=2119.6800000000003s)]
*  And then two days later, somebody finally snaps me out of it by knocking on my door. [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=2121.0s)]
*  It was my friend, Brendan, Brendan Lauer. [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=2126.2400000000002s)]
*  And I hear the knock on the slider door and I'm like, oh, fucking I put my guitar down on that. [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=2128.76s)]
*  I'll be right back. Like, don't like I hate to leave you like, oh, you know, [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=2133.76s)]
*  I wanted that guitar so bad still after two days straight of playing it. [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=2138.64s)]
*  And I go open the door and my friend, Brendan, is there. [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=2142.8799999999997s)]
*  He's like, what the fuck's all over your face? [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=2145.0s)]
*  And I'm like, what? And I go in the bathroom and I look in the mirror and my face is all green. [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=2148.04s)]
*  And I'm like, oh, fuck. Like, I thought it was like from the meth or something. [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=2152.92s)]
*  It was like, oh, no, my skin's turning green. [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=2156.56s)]
*  And it was from like this. [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=2158.92s)]
*  I was playing my guitar for so long that the bronze on my strings had like gone to my fingers and I had touched my face. [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=2160.04s)]
*  And so I had green shit on my face from my guitar strings and I was so twacked out, you know, [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=2167.08s)]
*  I didn't know what the fuck was going on. [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=2171.44s)]
*  But and I wonder if that gets like and have you heard any other stories that people are like that? [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=2174.04s)]
*  Do they do? Are they doing sex or they doing like, [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=2178.52s)]
*  man, I think when you're tweaking, you just like, what do you like to do? [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=2183.2799999999997s)]

*  And you're just sitting there. [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=2196.56s)]
*  Well, maybe on speed. I don't know. [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=2197.52s)]
*  Might take a while. Oh, yeah. [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=2199.28s)]
*  And you have to work for it. And then it's like even better. [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=2201.56s)]
*  Yeah. Well, that's probably like, yeah, I think like if I was all sped up, [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=2204.44s)]
*  I would just look out the windows, make a lot of promises to myself, look out the windows, [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=2209.48s)]

*  I'm going to organize things. That was always a term that I would use. [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=2221.44s)]
*  That's it. That's one thing people do, too. [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=2224.88s)]
*  I was at this crack house one time that was fucking spotless. [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=2227.36s)]
*  It was insane. And me and my friend went over there just to, you know, [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=2231.04s)]
*  we were going to smoke or whatever. And I had this homie that knew all the man. [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=2236.4s)]
*  He was just like connected somehow with like he would just go into a new city [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=2241.32s)]
*  and all of a sudden he would be like, oh, there's our guy. [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=2246.4s)]
*  Like, just how do you know that that random man on the bicycle is the guy? [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=2248.36s)]
*  Yeah. Some people are just they get that fucking that drug dog in. [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=2253.52s)]
*  They're street smart. Yeah, they're German shepherds. [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=2259.0s)]
*  Yeah, man. And so I had a buddy that was like that. [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=2261.16s)]
*  And so I ended up, you know, it was like there was one night [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=2263.48s)]
*  I smoked crack with a fully pregnant lady. [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=2266.48s)]
*  And it was like that's how shitty that stuff is. [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=2270.08s)]

*  It's like it's instantly addictive. [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=2277.44s)]
*  Like that first night I did it, like I was telling you when I was 16. [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=2280.12s)]
*  Yeah, I've always considered myself to have a pretty strong will. [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=2282.8s)]
*  And like I was saying, I've been around shit forever. [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=2286.6800000000003s)]

*  And then so I took a hit and then it was like, boom, I was like, oh, holy shit. [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=2298.0s)]
*  It was like crazy. [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=2304.0800000000004s)]

*  Well, tell us the downside of it. [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=2330.48s)]
*  The downside of it was so that people know that. [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=2331.76s)]
*  So anybody right now is trying to U-turn to go get some crack or whatever. [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=2334.76s)]
*  No, no, no, no, don't do it because it's oh, man. [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=2337.72s)]

*  I take one hit. [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=2349.08s)]
*  That pipe didn't make it around the circle before I was like, man, [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=2350.2799999999997s)]

*  Not good. It was bad. [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=2432.68s)]
*  And I would do a little bit of cocaine. [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=2434.2s)]
*  And then I would be like, all right. [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=2436.48s)]
*  Some of my friends hit me up like, let's go do something like, all right. [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=2438.68s)]
*  And then I would do some more. [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=2441.2s)]

*  let me go back in and just make sure I did some. [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=2446.52s)]
*  It was like, what is that even like? [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=2450.96s)]
*  That was a real thought of me. [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=2452.72s)]
*  Like, that's not even a little shit. [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=2453.96s)]
*  Let me make sure I did some. [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=2457.0s)]
*  I'm still pulling it out of my nose from the and I'm like, hey, bro, [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=2458.64s)]

*  What the fuck, dude, that's not so interesting. [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=2464.88s)]
*  Just to even think about how it hijacks our thoughts, man. [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=2468.56s)]
*  And if you can't even if you because your thoughts come out of nowhere. [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=2471.84s)]
*  So it's like if it gets above those, it's a fucking that's just [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=2475.12s)]
*  it just shows the power of it. [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=2480.6s)]
*  So, oh, man, I just want to. [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=2481.8s)]
*  Yeah, I think I think to say that kind of stuff is important, but it's [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=2483.72s)]
*  how do you get out of it then? [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=2487.0s)]
*  Well, like I said, it was like it was never a. [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=2488.92s)]

*  whether it was math or crack or heroin or whatever. [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=2497.4s)]
*  I would do it and then I would be like, OK, [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=2501.2799999999997s)]
*  it's like I know that I can't do it more than one day in a row. [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=2504.0s)]
*  We're speed if you do it, you know, I would smoke one little bit [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=2507.08s)]
*  and I'm good for the weekend is like I'd be up for two days [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=2510.68s)]

*  Like what you were talking about, looking out the window [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=2518.68s)]
*  and seeing silhouettes and shit. [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=2520.7999999999997s)]
*  There was one time where I went over to me were to to hang [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=2522.0s)]

*  Thursday to Monday and. [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=2530.72s)]
*  By like the third or fourth day of like being awake [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=2534.7599999999998s)]
*  and getting no sleep. [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=2538.44s)]
*  It's like my friend Jake, who I know well, [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=2540.88s)]
*  and I'm sitting right there next to him, but I'm looking at him [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=2543.64s)]
*  and it's like it's not his face on his face. [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=2546.8s)]
*  It's like somebody like some guy named Brandon or something. [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=2550.2799999999997s)]
*  It looks like a different guy. [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=2552.52s)]
*  And I'm like, Jake. And he's like, yeah. [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=2553.56s)]
*  And I'm like, you're not Jake, though. [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=2555.32s)]
*  Like the fuck I'm looking right at you. [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=2558.7599999999998s)]
*  And you start to really get after being awake for a couple of days. [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=2560.88s)]
*  I remember looking out my window and seeing silhouettes of like people [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=2564.0s)]
*  standing by the tree and like behind the car and like stuff. [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=2567.68s)]
*  And you think people are watching you and shit like paranoia [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=2570.64s)]
*  has got to be one of the worst fucking things that can happen. [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=2575.16s)]
*  Yeah, there's a comedian, Shane Moss, and he. [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=2579.24s)]
*  He was wanted to do a documentary, I think, and I'm paraphrasing [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=2583.9199999999996s)]
*  an amazing comedian, great guy. [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=2588.48s)]
*  Go see him if you get a chance. [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=2590.7599999999998s)]
*  And he he was on here once and he was talking about [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=2591.7999999999997s)]
*  he was trying to make a documentary about doing. [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=2596.0s)]
*  I want to say it was mushrooms, right? [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=2599.7200000000003s)]
*  But he got so like deep into it, he started getting paranoid [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=2602.7200000000003s)]
*  and he started thinking the documentary crew that he had hired [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=2607.44s)]
*  to shoot the documentary of him. [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=2612.7200000000003s)]
*  Were. That they were [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=2616.92s)]
*  like ops, like they were like government, like [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=2621.44s)]
*  he started to go down a real rabbit hole. [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=2626.1200000000003s)]
*  No, that's and then he started to give clues to the camera [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=2628.88s)]
*  so that when they he watched, whoever watched it would know that he knew like [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=2633.4s)]
*  he was getting deep. [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=2637.92s)]
*  I think there's a level to it because psychedelics is another thing [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=2640.56s)]
*  that I've dabbled in and I think. [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=2643.52s)]
*  I think psychedelics is a very positive thing. [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=2648.32s)]
*  Yeah, I am an advocate for psychedelics. [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=2651.52s)]
*  I'm not an advocate for meth crack, [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=2654.6000000000004s)]
*  Oxycontin, cocaine, any any of those things. [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=2658.48s)]
*  Little mushrooms, I think it's, you know, take a hit of acid. [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=2663.6800000000003s)]
*  And if you're brave, like a hit of DMT or something. [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=2667.36s)]
*  But it's not for everybody. [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=2672.84s)]
*  I don't think psychedelics are for everyone, but I think it can help a lot of people. [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=2674.84s)]
*  I think a lot of people would benefit from eating a mushroom stem [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=2679.2000000000003s)]
*  and going and sitting down by the riverbank, pitching a tent, [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=2683.32s)]
*  you know, making a fire and hanging out with some friends [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=2687.44s)]
*  and looking up at the trees and, you know, staring at a bug and realizing why. [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=2690.52s)]
*  You know, it's like I've hung out with like. [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=2694.44s)]
*  Like whenever you're around, like the Grateful Dead camp, you know, [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=2698.88s)]
*  Bob Weir and Bill Kreutzman and some of those cats like. [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=2702.84s)]
*  Like, for instance, when I was out in Hawaii, [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=2707.0800000000004s)]
*  hanging out with Bill Kreutzman and those guys, a lot of like the people [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=2708.7200000000003s)]
*  that are just around the friend group, they're all. [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=2712.12s)]
*  Like, and I noticed this while I was there, because these people are doctors [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=2716.44s)]
*  and, you know, intellects and, you know, there's there. [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=2720.2s)]
*  They're all adults who are still children, but they're not immature. [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=2725.7999999999997s)]
*  And it's like you see this 45 year old woman who has many degrees [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=2731.04s)]
*  sitting there staring at an aunt and being like, wow, you know, almost like a child. [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=2736.4s)]
*  And. I think it's just a great thing to not lose that. [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=2741.52s)]
*  Maybe some people get it without drugs. [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=2746.84s)]
*  I know my banjo player, Billy Failing, he might take a hit of weed, [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=2750.2000000000003s)]
*  like every once in a while, but he he's pretty doesn't do anything. [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=2754.88s)]
*  And I'm like talking to him about that, like, man, when I take some mushrooms [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=2759.8s)]
*  or whatever, I just feel like, you know, I feel like psychedelics [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=2763.7200000000003s)]
*  can make me feel like one with nature and and stuff like that. [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=2767.0s)]
*  And he's like, man, well, I get the same thing when I go on a three day long hike [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=2771.1600000000003s)]
*  and sleep on the ground, because him and his wife go on these outdoor, you know, [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=2776.2400000000002s)]
*  long hikes and stuff for like weeks at a time. [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=2781.84s)]
*  And they sleep on the ground and they, you know, Grand Canyon or where, you know, [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=2784.32s)]
*  oh, national parks and shit. [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=2788.44s)]
*  Yeah. And being lost, but it's like organized, you know, go and shit in a hole for a week. [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=2790.1200000000003s)]
*  You get one with nature pretty quick. Oh, yeah. Without drugs. [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=2794.92s)]
*  Yeah. But taking some shrooms or acid or something can really get you there [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=2798.8799999999997s)]
*  a lot quicker. It's like, well, shrooms are a connector, I think. [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=2802.9199999999996s)]
*  And even fungus itself is like a expensatory type of thing. [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=2806.9199999999996s)]
*  You know, it's like a it's that thing that fills in the space, you know, like. [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=2811.72s)]
*  So it's like a call almost in a way. [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=2816.8799999999997s)]
*  So, yeah, I definitely I think that mushrooms are great. [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=2820.72s)]
*  I've always thought that, yeah, you can get a little crazy [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=2824.6s)]
*  and then your buddies fucking somebody's doing the Heimlich maneuver on him [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=2827.04s)]
*  at a damn Waffle House or something. [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=2830.32s)]
*  And the guy's hitting on your friend or something. [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=2832.32s)]
*  He's a kid or whatever. But the problem, the biggest problem, I think, is [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=2834.88s)]
*  is you just run the risk of people not being able to do it in [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=2841.12s)]
*  in some sort of control or moderation. [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=2845.6s)]
*  I was just going to say the moderation. [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=2847.2799999999997s)]
*  That's the key with everything. [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=2850.24s)]
*  But we're getting more to the point now you're seeing like I have people [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=2851.92s)]
*  that hit me up that I say, hey, man, you should work with this therapist. [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=2854.6s)]
*  They do like mushroom guided therapy, right? [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=2856.88s)]
*  Like and you see a lot more like ketamine guided therapy. Right. [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=2860.6s)]
*  And I wask adventures like you're seeing things where [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=2863.56s)]
*  I think people are getting away from the idea of like just I just want to poison [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=2867.84s)]
*  myself like with alcohol, which is a fun poison. [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=2871.96s)]
*  I'm not saying it's bad. I'm not condemning anybody that drinks. [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=2874.6800000000003s)]
*  Like I would be drinking if I didn't go buy cocaine and end up trying to. [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=2877.6400000000003s)]
*  You know, no, if I was a responsible adult, I would drink too. [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=2881.84s)]
*  But I'm not right. Yeah. [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=2885.76s)]
*  You know, yeah, I'm not responsible. [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=2889.36s)]
*  So anyway, but yeah, I think I just think we're seeing like kind of a [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=2891.92s)]
*  a stray from that a little bit. [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=2896.5200000000004s)]
*  This is yours, man. Yeah. [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=2899.0800000000004s)]
*  You bought this for me, man. [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=2900.92s)]
*  Yes, sir. This month, I brought you a couple cases of it. [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=2902.84s)]
*  No, really? Yeah. [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=2905.32s)]
*  But this can is great, man. [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=2906.6400000000003s)]
*  It's made by Shorts Brewing Company, which is a place where [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=2908.28s)]
*  I celebrated my 21st birthday party, actually. [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=2911.8s)]
*  And I used to play gigs there all the time. [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=2914.88s)]
*  And they're just my homies from back home. [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=2918.0s)]
*  And since I don't drink, you know, we wanted to do a collab anyways, [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=2919.96s)]
*  but we made this sparkling. [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=2923.08s)]
*  It's like a hop water. [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=2924.4s)]
*  Well, it's good. It is good. I love it. [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=2926.2400000000002s)]
*  And it's just that this is the name of thirst meter later. [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=2929.52s)]
*  Mm hmm. Wow. [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=2931.8s)]
*  You want to hear a DMT story or two? [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=2934.96s)]
*  Yeah. And I'll trade you one. [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=2937.6400000000003s)]
*  And then and then we'll get back into your music. [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=2939.2400000000002s)]
*  You. Yeah. [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=2942.6s)]
*  We don't have to get back in anything. [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=2943.7599999999998s)]
*  But I don't want people to forget that you're a music. [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=2944.92s)]
*  Psycho not Billy Strings. [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=2948.3999999999996s)]
*  Psycho not. That's what Shane Moss was a psycho. [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=2950.7999999999997s)]
*  Nice. But yeah, let's go down a DMT story. [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=2952.92s)]
*  Well, because I feel like, you know, [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=2955.56s)]
*  since I'm talking about all the other bad bullshit that I've done, I need to [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=2959.44s)]
*  kind of clear my name here [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=2963.68s)]
*  and tell you about some of the better stuff that has happened to me [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=2966.3999999999996s)]
*  because of my experience. [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=2970.08s)]
*  Yeah, it's important. [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=2974.7999999999997s)]
*  Like when I was living in Traverse City, [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=2977.2s)]
*  there's this man, my buddy, Seth, he's gone now, too. [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=2981.7999999999997s)]
*  This sucks because he, you know, I'm fucking opiates, man. [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=2984.3199999999997s)]
*  God is ass. But he was my buddy who always had whatever. [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=2989.04s)]
*  He was like into the EDM scene and shit. [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=2994.12s)]
*  Yeah. And he would like just have a backpack, which. [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=2996.7599999999998s)]
*  Oh, yeah. I got whatever, bro. [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=2999.36s)]
*  So he would come over and whatever. [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=3001.44s)]
*  One time he had this DMT. [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=3003.2400000000002s)]
*  So let me get a little bit, you know, so, you know, [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=3005.7200000000003s)]
*  you know, [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=3010.96s)]
*  let me get a little bit. I'll buy some off you. [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=3014.1200000000003s)]
*  Right. So he hooks me up with a little bag [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=3015.84s)]
*  and that bag sat on top of my dresser for fucking. [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=3018.48s)]
*  I don't even know. Six months. [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=3022.0s)]
*  Yeah. Because that's the other thing about psychedelics that I'll say is like. [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=3024.2000000000003s)]
*  It's not something to play around with. [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=3029.0s)]
*  If you're not in the headspace for it, don't do it. [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=3030.96s)]
*  You know, it's like it's kind of. [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=3033.6s)]
*  And I've learned that lesson from psychedelics. [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=3036.44s)]
*  It's almost like dipping your toe in the pool or something. [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=3038.72s)]
*  And it's like, don't do that. [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=3042.88s)]
*  Just, you know, if you want to go swimming or not, do or don't you? [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=3044.96s)]
*  Right. Do you want to stay dry or do you want to get wet? Right. [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=3048.64s)]
*  OK. Yeah. And if you're wearing something that can't get wet, [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=3051.52s)]
*  then fucking don't. Yeah. [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=3054.44s)]
*  Then just chill. Yeah. [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=3056.44s)]
*  Like if your attitude is an attitude that can't get wet right now. [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=3058.08s)]
*  Yeah. Then just stay on the bank. [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=3061.44s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah, exactly. [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=3063.36s)]
*  But so I was, you know, it took me six months to gain up [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=3065.2000000000003s)]
*  the courage to to hit this DMT. [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=3069.44s)]
*  And one day I came home from work and there was nobody home. [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=3073.88s)]
*  My roommates were gone. [[00:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=3077.32s)]
*  I knew they weren't going to be back because they were downstate. [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=3078.32s)]
*  And I had the house to myself. The sun was shining. [[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=3081.0s)]
*  I was like, you know what, I'm feeling pretty good today. [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=3083.88s)]
*  It's like I'm happy. The sun's out. [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=3086.16s)]
*  Fuck it. Nobody's home. [[00:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=3089.24s)]
*  Like, I'm just going to rip this DMT. Let's try it. [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=3090.48s)]
*  So and I was also ignorant at the time about what it even really was. [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=3092.96s)]
*  And I didn't know what to expect. [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=3097.56s)]
*  So I wasn't really scared of it. [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=3098.8799999999997s)]
*  Now, I haven't done it in years, even though it's been so enlightening and helpful. [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=3100.44s)]
*  I'm I haven't done it in years because of how intense it is. [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=3104.3199999999997s)]
*  But this at this time, I was like 21 or something. [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=3109.0s)]
*  Just like, man, I'm just going to rip this DMT. [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=3111.7999999999997s)]
*  And so I sat on the couch and like took a big hit of this. [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=3115.44s)]
*  And I was listening to this song. [[00:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=3123.64s)]
*  It was actually the Oh, Brother, Where Art Thou soundtrack. [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=3125.52s)]
*  I'll Fly Away with Killian Welch and Emmy Liu and Alison Krauss [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=3128.8s)]
*  and Mike Compton and, you know, all these instruments and stuff. [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=3133.08s)]
*  And I hit this and all of a sudden I'm kind of floating and the instruments [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=3136.28s)]
*  are surrounding me and it's all this beautiful kind of shit happening. [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=3139.04s)]
*  And I start to see this blue light and I'm like, well, what's that? [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=3143.24s)]
*  It's like this blue light way up ahead in the distance. [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=3146.8s)]
*  And it's getting closer and closer to me. [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=3149.0s)]
*  And all of a sudden it's like, well, it's a chick. [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=3151.2s)]
*  And I'm like, I can see this lady and she's swirling and dancing. [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=3154.2s)]
*  And she starts murmuring this ancient language that is brand new, [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=3158.76s)]
*  something that this language has only been used right now [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=3164.48s)]
*  for this particular occasion, but it's ancient. [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=3168.84s)]
*  And I understood every word somehow. [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=3171.04s)]
*  Some, you know, she's telling me this information as she's spinning [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=3173.48s)]
*  and twirling and dancing for me. [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=3177.6s)]
*  And she's wearing this skirt. [[00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=3179.08s)]
*  And every time she twirls, her skirt kind of twirls like that. [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=3181.16s)]
*  And it's made of like eyeballs. [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=3185.64s)]
*  And then she does a 360 and it's made of ears and then teeth and then hair, [[00:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=3187.84s)]
*  noses and pupils and just all these different facial features. [[00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=3191.84s)]
*  Her skirt was like made up of like thousands of them. [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=3195.68s)]
*  And every time she turned, it would change. [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=3199.6000000000004s)]
*  And she gets she's getting closer and closer to me. [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=3201.96s)]
*  And then she got close enough to me and she kind of like [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=3204.0800000000004s)]
*  caressed me in a way, like put her arms around me and was like, are you good? [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=3208.0800000000004s)]
*  I'm like, I'm good. [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=3212.0s)]
*  And then we went like shot me out of the atmosphere, [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=3213.32s)]
*  out of outer space, like through this placenta [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=3218.6800000000003s)]
*  where we kind of broke through. [[00:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=3223.76s)]
*  And then it was like we were on this beautiful pink mountain top [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=3225.2s)]
*  overlooking this vast everything. [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=3229.08s)]
*  And she was kind of standing me on top of the mountain, [[00:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=3232.2799999999997s)]
*  pointing and looking and showing me everything. [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=3234.92s)]
*  These are all the universes. [[00:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=3237.08s)]
*  Notice how they're spinning and working together like a gear, [[00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=3239.3199999999997s)]
*  like a watch, like a clock, like a movement. [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=3242.7599999999998s)]
*  And then she zapped us down super Zillow or something. [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=3245.64s)]
*  It was like all the universes spinning. [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=3248.2s)]
*  And then she took me down to our universe [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=3250.56s)]
*  and showed me all the galaxies doing that same thing. [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=3252.92s)]
*  And then she took me to our galaxy, showed me all of the planets doing it. [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=3255.7200000000003s)]
*  Then to our planet and showed me the wind and water and currents. [[00:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=3259.96s)]
*  And and then to a grain of sand. [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=3263.16s)]
*  It was like a fractal out from everything. [[00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=3265.64s)]
*  And everything is spinning and working together. [[00:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=3268.56s)]
*  Yeah. Doing the dance. Yeah. [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=3272.16s)]
*  What you do affects your neighbor, you know, and basically. [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=3273.96s)]
*  She told me it was like, you need to be strong in yourself. [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=3278.24s)]
*  You need to work on yourself, work on your mental health, work on, you know, [[00:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=3283.08s)]

*  Yeah. Well, it's it's just interesting, the relationship that we have with ourselves. [[00:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=3382.44s)]
*  It's like, like we've outsourced our own responsibility. [[00:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=3386.52s)]
*  A lot of times it feels like like it's like I need it's almost like I look entirely at medicine [[00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=3392.48s)]
*  or at other people for my responsibility to for me to be OK. [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=3398.04s)]
*  Right. Which I'm not saying that we don't need other people. [[00:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=3403.08s)]
*  We need help. And we do need help. [[00:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=3405.32s)]
*  We do need like therapy. We need communication. [[00:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=3407.68s)]
*  And sometimes we need medicine. Yeah. [[00:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=3411.04s)]
*  But I think that we can fall into a trap or I know that I have. [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=3413.0s)]
*  That's what I should just say. [[00:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=3416.52s)]
*  I've fallen into a trap at times where I've completely outsourced [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=3417.68s)]
*  if I'm going to be OK on to other people and things like I haven't [[00:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=3423.68s)]
*  that the relationship that I have with myself is so. [[00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=3429.6s)]
*  It's not even there a lot of times, or it hasn't been that I'm reliant [[00:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=3433.24s)]
*  completely on if other things are going to make me OK, as opposed to like [[00:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=3437.08s)]
*  I think there was a time probably a long time ago, maybe. [[00:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=3442.3199999999997s)]
*  And I may romanticize the past sometimes, but where I felt like [[00:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=3444.96s)]
*  people had a bit more like agency or something that's called with themselves, [[00:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=3449.0s)]
*  where they had more of a relationship with themselves, you know, [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=3452.44s)]
*  and they reflected on themselves more and reflected on experiences and behaviors. [[00:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=3456.04s)]
*  And and just like [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=3460.0s)]
*  just had a little bit more probably [[00:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=3462.96s)]
*  say in how they were doing, you know, or how they were feeling [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=3466.04s)]
*  or what was going on with them. [[00:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=3469.48s)]
*  And I don't even think we've done it on purpose. [[00:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=3471.12s)]
*  I just think a lot of it's the way our society has kind of shaped things. [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=3472.72s)]
*  Well, nowadays you just look down at your Fitbit or whatever. [[00:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=3475.64s)]
*  My heart's beating. Everything's good. [[00:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=3479.04s)]
*  Yeah. My buddy has a fat bit. [[00:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=3481.0s)]
*  My buddy, Bert Kreischer, it just he looks at it and just tells me he's fat. [[00:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=3482.7999999999997s)]
*  Oh, man. [[00:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=3485.9199999999996s)]
*  I broke you got to get him. [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=3487.6s)]
*  You need to get him like a mechanical watch. [[00:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=3490.72s)]
*  Yeah, we did. [[00:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=3492.56s)]
*  Well, we need to get him a method to take that thing apart. [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=3493.7999999999997s)]
*  Yeah. Put it back together. [[00:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=3497.3999999999996s)]
*  Yeah. So when people were on methamphetamines, [[00:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=3499.04s)]
*  if they take that stuff apart, what are they then looking to do with it? [[00:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=3502.08s)]
*  Is it a why do people take that kind of stuff apart? Is it? [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=3504.88s)]
*  I don't know. I think maybe to put it back together better. [[00:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=3509.88s)]
*  But what I was saying is like, whatever you do, if you did speed, [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=3512.56s)]
*  I feel like that's what you do. [[00:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=3515.84s)]

*  Oh, yeah. I'm making necklaces, making jewelry, or they would, [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=3520.52s)]
*  you know, draw pictures or write lyrics or poetry or, you know, it's just, [[00:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=3523.6s)]
*  you know, it's kind of like whatever you do. [[00:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=3527.92s)]
*  If you have like a little thing that you like to do. [[00:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=3529.36s)]

*  Oh, dude. OK, check this out. [[00:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=3533.56s)]
*  So there was this place, Barkus Park, where I grew up. [[00:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=3535.52s)]
*  And Barkus is for dogs. [[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=3538.52s)]
*  Well, B-A-R-K-U-S, Barkus Park, Barkus Park in Lyons, Michigan. [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=3541.56s)]
*  And so it was a campground. [[00:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=3547.96s)]
*  My buddy, Brad, Brad Lascoe, owned it. [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=3550.92s)]
*  He was like my uncle Brad. He was my dad's best friend. [[00:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=3554.04s)]
*  He played the banjo. Oh, wow. [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=3556.12s)]
*  And he was like our yeah, Barkus campground. [[00:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=3557.6s)]
*  So this place, when I was growing up, dude, yeah, there we are right there. [[00:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=3560.92s)]
*  There's little Bradley Picken, man. [[00:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=3564.48s)]
*  That's where I grew up, man. [[00:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=3566.48s)]
*  That's the vibe. That's my dad right there above him. [[00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=3567.48s)]
*  No way. That's the damn Google image that's on this park. Yeah. [[00:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=3569.44s)]
*  So I think this is just, it's a yard, bro. [[00:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=3574.16s)]
*  Dude, that's that's how I grew up right there, bro. [[00:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=3577.76s)]
*  Sitting on that campground, picking just like that. [[00:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=3580.28s)]
*  That's my childhood. And so it was epic, man. [[00:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=3582.8s)]
*  There's Stoney Creeks right there. [[00:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=3587.44s)]
*  The salmon run every year in the fall. [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=3588.6s)]
*  We were like spearing salmon back then. [[00:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=3590.6s)]
*  Yeah, I won't tell anybody. It was crazy. [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=3592.48s)]
*  But this dude, Brad Lascoe, there we go. [[00:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=3594.64s)]
*  That's what I was just going to say. [[00:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=3598.0s)]
*  They found out. So my childhood there was great. [[00:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=3599.48s)]
*  But as I got a little older, 10, 12 years old, [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=3603.36s)]
*  all that meth moved in and fucked everything up and everybody up, [[01:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=3606.56s)]
*  including Barkus Park. [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=3610.24s)]
*  And they, while everybody was tweaking on meth, [[01:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=3612.16s)]
*  found out that there was gold in the creek. [[01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=3615.9199999999996s)]
*  No way. Oh, my God. [[01:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=3619.24s)]
*  Can you imagine a better activity for meth head than panning for gold? [[01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=3620.64s)]
*  No, I can't at all. [[01:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=3624.72s)]
*  Dude, I mean, it's like panning it all literally sifting through every grain [[01:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=3626.6s)]
*  of sand in the fucking creek to find specks of gold like that. [[01:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=3630.04s)]
*  How could you do that and not be a meth head? [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=3634.2799999999997s)]
*  Dude, why every meth recovery center isn't currently located along a river [[01:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=3637.3599999999997s)]
*  or stream in this country? [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=3642.72s)]
*  I will never understand. [[01:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=3645.72s)]
*  We have got to organize meth users and get this gold. [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=3648.08s)]
*  Yeah, seriously, because we could get some big bucks. [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=3653.88s)]
*  Dude, that's unbelievable, bro. [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=3656.56s)]
*  Do you have you written a song about that? [[01:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=3659.24s)]
*  I'm not about panning for gold. [[01:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=3661.24s)]
*  I wrote one called dust in the baggie. [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=3662.44s)]
*  Yes, that's about Brad Lascoe, man. [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=3664.04s)]
*  That's yeah, he just passed away a couple of years ago, too, man. [[01:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=3666.08s)]
*  That me and dad record, you know, we dedicated it to Brad. [[01:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=3670.68s)]
*  Oh, that's him? No, that's this is the video for it. [[01:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=3673.3199999999997s)]
*  Well, yeah, that's a video for it. [[01:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=3677.3599999999997s)]
*  OK, I wouldn't play it. [[01:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=3680.64s)]
*  But no, that's a famous video now because of that guy in the background. [[01:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=3683.0s)]
*  Barefoot Ben, we were all on mushrooms that night. [[01:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=3687.3999999999996s)]
*  We were sitting in my buddy, [[01:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=3689.9199999999996s)]
*  one of my friend Gina's basement, and we're all picking songs. [[01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=3692.68s)]
*  And there was a big party upstairs and everybody was drunk. [[01:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=3696.7999999999997s)]
*  But we were all tripping. [[01:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=3699.68s)]
*  So we wanted to go downstairs and be quiet and get away from all the drunks. [[01:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=3700.68s)]
*  So we were sitting down there in that basement and picking tunes. [[01:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=3703.68s)]
*  And then, yeah, Barefoot Ben there, man. [[01:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=3707.48s)]
*  He was he was like the only hippie like in Ionia that you know what I mean? [[01:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=3709.2s)]
*  It was like, I mean, I guess there was a couple like skater kids or whatever. [[01:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=3713.8399999999997s)]
*  But he was like Barefoot at every party. [[01:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=3717.68s)]
*  He was like wearing tie dye. [[01:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=3719.3599999999997s)]
*  He like people call him Barefoot Ben or hippie. [[01:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=3720.96s)]
*  And yeah, like like I said, he was like the only hippie around. [[01:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=3724.08s)]
*  But he was at every party. [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=3728.3199999999997s)]
*  He lived it. He was at every party. [[01:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=3729.56s)]
*  And he was like, how did you get here? [[01:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=3731.7999999999997s)]
*  Like, who do you know here? [[01:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=3733.36s)]
*  Like he was just every party. [[01:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=3734.6s)]
*  He was there. And in this video, he's literally like we're tripping. [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=3736.32s)]
*  And I'm just playing these songs and he's smoking an unlit cigarette [[01:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=3740.7999999999997s)]
*  and he keeps hitting it like it's lit. [[01:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=3743.6s)]
*  And like, I don't think he does it. [[01:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=3745.12s)]
*  But if you look at the comments on that shit is hilarious. [[01:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=3746.6s)]
*  Like they're talking about Ben, like this dude looks like he's standing there [[01:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=3750.0s)]
*  giving out side quests and shit. [[01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=3753.48s)]
*  Oh, yeah. No. [[01:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=3755.32s)]
*  Shout out, Ben. [[01:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=3758.24s)]
*  Hope you're doing good, buddy. [[01:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=3759.52s)]
*  Barefoot Ben. Amen, brother. [[01:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=3760.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=3762.4799999999996s)]
*  Man, they just found a huge golden nugget. [[01:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=3763.4799999999996s)]
*  Do you can you look that up for me? [[01:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=3765.72s)]
*  Where? There we go. [[01:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=3768.9199999999996s)]
*  Biggest gold nugget ever found that weighed as much as a person. [[01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=3770.7599999999998s)]
*  Shit. [[01:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=3773.9599999999996s)]
*  Would be worth an insane amount today. [[01:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=3775.12s)]
*  The biggest nugget in the golden world weighed as much as an adult man. [[01:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=3777.9599999999996s)]
*  Millions. [[01:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=3782.4399999999996s)]
*  John Deason and Richard O'Tich the jackpot. [[01:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=3783.4799999999996s)]
*  Oh, this is an 1869 when they saw a little bit. [[01:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=3785.64s)]
*  Australia, when they found they discovered the monster nugget [[01:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=3790.2s)]
*  while digging in Australia. Yeah. [[01:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=3794.12s)]
*  Weighing in at 11 stones or 72 kilograms. [[01:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=3796.44s)]
*  Still no idea how much that is. [[01:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=3800.92s)]
*  I think it's 220 pounds. [[01:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=3802.2s)]
*  Eleven stone. [[01:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=3803.64s)]
*  It was weighed at a London charter bank and they were paid just under [[01:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=3805.7599999999998s)]
*  $10,000 for the massive chunk in 1869. [[01:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=3809.3599999999997s)]
*  Yeah. What do you think you'd do if you got that thing, brother? [[01:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=3813.2s)]
*  If you're on math and let's say this, let's go on down a road, all right? [[01:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=3815.6s)]
*  That doesn't exist, but we have zoning rights in this space. [[01:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=3818.48s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=3824.0s)]
*  If we find a chunk of gold the size of a man and people are on math, [[01:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=3825.0s)]
*  do you tell other people you have it or do you... [[01:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=3830.48s)]
*  Like are math people, can they keep a secret or is it not a secret area? [[01:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=3834.88s)]
*  That's a good question. [[01:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=3841.0s)]
*  I don't know. I feel like some people can, some people can't. [[01:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=3842.08s)]
*  You know, I feel... [[01:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=3845.68s)]
*  Yeah, we would just pawn that fucker. It would just go to the pawn shop. [[01:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=3848.68s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, it would go to the closest pawn shop. [[01:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=3851.68s)]
*  I would probably give it away for two racks, bro. [[01:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=3853.68s)]
*  Yeah, dude. I mean, fucking two racks. [[01:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=3856.68s)]
*  How many boxes can I get with that? [[01:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=3858.68s)]
*  Right. I don't know. [[01:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=3860.68s)]
*  We just got to drive all over Michigan to get it. [[01:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=3861.68s)]
*  It's Sudafed Central. [[01:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=3863.68s)]
*  I remember when they started locking up the Sudafed, man. [[01:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=3864.68s)]
*  Oh, yeah. Yeah, you got to show your ID and shit for it. [[01:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=3867.68s)]
*  I was like, I have a fucking runny nose. [[01:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=3869.68s)]
*  That used to be your ID to get Sudafed [[01:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=3871.68s)]
*  and now everything has changed. [[01:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=3873.68s)]
*  And yeah, not condoning drugs, but just sharing experiences. [[01:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=3876.68s)]
*  People get that. [[01:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=3879.68s)]
*  It's kind of like the shit that I've been through [[01:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=3880.68s)]
*  and the stuff that I've seen and all that is [[01:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=3883.68s)]
*  the reason that I can do what I do today. [[01:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=3888.68s)]
*  I kind of got it out of my system in a way. [[01:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=3890.68s)]
*  Wow. [[01:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=3892.68s)]
*  But it's... [[01:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=3893.68s)]
*  I don't want to go back. [[01:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=3895.68s)]
*  Right. [[01:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=3896.68s)]
*  That's the thing. I don't want to go back to... [[01:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=3897.68s)]
*  Why? [[01:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=3899.68s)]
*  Because it sucks. [[01:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=3900.68s)]
*  Because it sucks. [[01:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=3901.68s)]
*  It's a miserable life. [[01:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=3902.68s)]
*  I mean, who wants to be sitting in a tweaker pad with no food [[01:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=3904.68s)]
*  and start... [[01:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=3907.68s)]
*  I mean, it might feel good for a couple hours, [[01:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=3909.68s)]
*  but real quick, it gets real bad. [[01:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=3912.68s)]
*  Man, it ruins people's lives. [[01:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=3915.68s)]
*  It ruins families. [[01:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=3916.68s)]
*  Yeah. Look, that's just what I want... [[01:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=3921.68s)]
*  You said it better than I could have thought a way to say it. [[01:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=3922.68s)]
*  That's the truth. [[01:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=3925.68s)]
*  There's a message you did. [[01:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=3927.68s)]
*  This was almost a decade ago. [[01:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=3928.68s)]
*  I think we were looking online. [[01:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=3930.68s)]
*  Obviously, we were looking up things about you online. [[01:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=3931.68s)]
*  And we found this post that you put up. [[01:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=3936.68s)]
*  This is like almost 11 years ago now. [[01:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=3939.68s)]
*  Yep. I remember that day. [[01:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=3941.68s)]
*  Man, I was working at this... [[01:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=3943.68s)]
*  You were in Acme, Michigan. [[01:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=3945.68s)]
*  I'm just going to read it. Is that okay, Billy? [[01:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=3946.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=3947.68s)]
*  It says, I put in my two weeks notice today at work. [[01:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=3948.68s)]
*  I decided to pursue music as a career. [[01:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=3950.68s)]
*  Maybe I'm going out on a limb by doing this, but I don't care. [[01:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=3952.68s)]
*  I am ambitious and passionate enough to try it. [[01:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=3955.68s)]
*  Working eight hours and then gigging all the time is physically and mentally stressful [[01:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=3960.68s)]
*  and leaves me no time at all for creative output. [[01:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=3963.68s)]
*  I'm going to work very hard, practice, and write music every day. [[01:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=3965.68s)]
*  Besides, there has been nights that I've made more money in one hour playing music [[01:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=3969.68s)]
*  than I'm making two weeks at work. [[01:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=3973.68s)]
*  I want to thank all of you for the support. [[01:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=3974.68s)]
*  Without you, I would not be able to make this decision. [[01:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=3976.68s)]
*  Cheers. [[01:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=3979.68s)]
*  Yeah, man. [[01:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=3980.68s)]
*  That's cool, man. It's just a cool thing to put into the universe. [[01:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=3981.68s)]
*  What was that feeling like? [[01:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=3984.68s)]
*  So at that point, I guess you decided what you wanted to do. [[01:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=3985.68s)]
*  That was at a point where I was working at this hotel, the Grand Traverse Resort. [[01:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=3989.68s)]
*  I was partying, and I was working, and I was playing lots of gigs. [[01:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=3994.68s)]
*  The gigs were starting to... [[01:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=4001.68s)]
*  I was saving up money for guitars and stuff. [[01:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=4003.68s)]
*  I had this little pile of money in my top dresser drawer [[01:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=4007.68s)]
*  so I could finally get this guitar that was worth like $2,500 that I always wanted. [[01:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=4009.68s)]
*  Yes. [[01:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=4014.68s)]
*  And I was realizing as I'm saving up money, I was going, [[01:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=4015.68s)]
*  well, I used to just live off the hotel check. [[01:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=4018.68s)]
*  I used to not have the gigs, which what I made from the hotel was like, [[01:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=4021.68s)]
*  I don't know, like $800 every fucking two weeks or something. [[01:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=4024.68s)]
*  But it was enough to pay my rent and get gas back and forth to work and shit. [[01:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=4028.68s)]
*  Stay alive. [[01:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=4034.68s)]
*  Yeah, but then I started playing gigs too. [[01:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=4035.68s)]
*  And I would be out playing a gig until, you know, I'd play a gig until 11 or so, [[01:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=4038.68s)]
*  but then there'd be a party afterwards. [[01:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=4047.68s)]
*  So afterwards I'd go to the party and I'd be up till 5 in the morning, [[01:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=4049.68s)]
*  and then I'd get an hour and a half of sleep, and then I'd go into work hungover, [[01:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=4052.68s)]
*  and then work all day and hate it, and then go back, [[01:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=4057.68s)]
*  and then 6 o'clock would come around and I'd be back on stage somewhere. [[01:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=4062.68s)]
*  And I was burning the candle at both ends, and I could just feel it closing in on me. [[01:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=4066.68s)]
*  It's like, well, you got to choose one or the other. [[01:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=4070.68s)]
*  And it was like, like I said, I used to make only like $800 at work. [[01:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=4072.68s)]
*  Now I'm making $1,200 from music. [[01:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=4076.68s)]
*  I don't need, I mean, it was nice to have both the check and the music, [[01:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=4078.68s)]
*  but I used to just live off this and was fine. [[01:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=4083.68s)]
*  So, okay, fuck the job. I'm just going to live off the music, you know, [[01:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=4085.68s)]
*  and basically have the same amount of bread or whatever. [[01:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=4089.68s)]
*  So I just started putting all my energy into it. [[01:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=4093.68s)]
*  And what did that look like when you say putting all your energy into it? [[01:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=4096.68s)]
*  Because I think that's kind of interesting to think about, you know? [[01:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=4099.68s)]
*  Like, is it just, well, for one, you made it your focus point. [[01:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=4102.68s)]
*  You kind of told the universe, hey, this is going to be what I'm going to do. [[01:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=4104.68s)]
*  You know, you put that out there. [[01:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=4107.68s)]
*  So that's interesting because I think the universe does listen to us, you know? [[01:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=4109.68s)]
*  I don't think we talk to it enough, but I think it listens to us. [[01:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=4112.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=4116.68s)]
*  But then, so then what started to happen to there musically? [[01:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=4117.68s)]
*  Well, I was already playing gigs. [[01:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=4120.68s)]
*  Like, we had like a weekly gig at this place called Little Bohemia in Traverse City, [[01:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=4122.68s)]
*  and we were playing like shorts and, you know, like all these different, [[01:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=4127.68s)]
*  like we'd play breweries, coffee houses, stuff like that for tips and for whatever, you know? [[01:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=4130.68s)]
*  And I was like a weekend warrior and just a working musician. [[01:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=4135.68s)]
*  I'd play at the steakhouse. I'd play at the fucking brewery, you know, whatever. [[01:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=4140.68s)]
*  But it just, you know, once I kind of got the job out of there, then it was like, okay. [[01:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=4146.68s)]
*  And what I meant in that post is like, I'm not fucking around. [[01:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=4153.68s)]
*  Like, I'm going to practice. I'm going to write songs. I'm going to take this very seriously. [[01:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=4157.68s)]
*  Because of the folks that were out there coming to my little weekly gigs and stuff [[01:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=4162.68s)]
*  and making it to where I could pay my rent just with music, [[01:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=4167.68s)]
*  I felt like I had a duty to basically give back to those folks that supported me and say, [[01:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=4171.68s)]
*  look, if you continue to support me, I'm not going to fucking, I'm not fucking around. [[01:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=4177.68s)]
*  Like, I'm really, I will really work hard if you guys will still support me, you know? [[01:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=4183.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=4187.68s)]
*  And so I just, that's what I decided to do, man. And that was like around the time I was like 18. [[01:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=4188.68s)]
*  And well, let's see. I'm 31. That was 2010. Anybody good at math? [[01:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=4193.68s)]
*  It's 11 years ago. [[01:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=4198.68s)]
*  It's 11 years ago. I think, I'm guessing I might go to math. [[01:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=4200.68s)]
*  No, yeah, it's 11 years. [[01:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=4204.68s)]
*  Oh, it is. Good. [[01:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=4206.68s)]
*  So what's that? I was like 21? 20? [[01:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=4207.68s)]
*  20 or 21? [[01:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=4210.68s)]
*  Yeah. So at that point I had already been on tour and shit. [[01:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=4211.68s)]
*  I had like, you know, when I was 19, I had been on tour. [[01:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=4214.68s)]
*  By the time I was 19, I was playing 200 gigs a year. [[01:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=4218.68s)]
*  Oh my God. [[01:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=4220.68s)]
*  And I did that up until just a couple of years ago. [[01:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=4221.68s)]
*  Do you think, what do you think are the things, I know that you had like some viral moments online. [[01:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=4224.68s)]
*  What do you think are the things that really like cemented you in with people? [[01:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=4229.68s)]
*  Like do you think it's a way that you play? Do you think it's, because I think artists start to see this. [[01:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=4235.68s)]
*  Some artists are great performers. Some artists are, they're captivating. [[01:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=4243.68s)]
*  They can make a unique sound or do something new or novel. [[01:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=4249.68s)]
*  Some of you go for the songs and you don't even know anything about the artist or care about the artist at all. [[01:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=4255.68s)]
*  Right. [[01:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=4260.68s)]
*  Does that make any sense to you? [[01:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=4261.68s)]
*  No, that's a really interesting thing that I've, I kind of learned that the first time that I went to the Grammys. [[01:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=4262.68s)]
*  Because I'm a guitar player. I'm a bluegrass musician. [[01:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=4270.68s)]
*  I grew up singing around the campfire. There's no computers. There's no auto-tune. There's no backup dancers. [[01:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=4273.68s)]
*  I went to the Grammys and I saw all this shit and I was like, whoa. [[01:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=4279.68s)]
*  You know, like the K-pop group, like BTS and shit. [[01:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=4284.68s)]
*  And I was just, they're like, I was like, okay, well none of them are singing. [[01:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=4287.68s)]
*  They're all, this is all pre-recorded tracks, but they're dancing their fucking asses off. [[01:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=4291.68s)]
*  I was like, oh, they're dancers. They're not musician. They're like, they're not a musician like me. [[01:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=4296.68s)]
*  Like I stand there in blue jeans on stage and strum the guitar and sing songs. That's what I do. [[01:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=4302.68s)]
*  Lady Gaga can direct an entire fucking orchestra to, you know, she can sing, act, dance. [[01:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=4308.68s)]
*  She's a comedian. You know, like there's just, some people have the whole umbrella over them. [[01:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=4316.68s)]
*  You know, I'm just like a musician. [[01:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=4321.68s)]
*  And so going to the Grammys and seeing like, you know, somebody with like all the backup dancers doing all the moves and stuff. [[01:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=4325.68s)]
*  And I was like, I like, like I said, I grew up going to bluegrass festivals. I never seen that shit. [[01:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=4332.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=4336.68s)]
*  I was like, whoa, this is, they're not actually singing, but still cool. Cause I guess they're dancers. [[01:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=4337.68s)]
*  But you know, I've always been sort of like a, like a grass hole. You know, that's what you call it. [[01:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=4345.68s)]
*  It's like, you know, auto tune or anything like that. [[01:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=4349.68s)]
*  Oh, I see what you're saying. More of the uh. [[01:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=4352.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=4353.68s)]
*  It's like, you know, I worked my ass off my whole life to learn how to sing and play. [[01:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=4354.68s)]
*  And then there's folks out there that are just pressing a button on a computer and singing through auto tune and shit. [[01:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=4357.68s)]
*  And they're selling millions of records. It's like, that's not fucking fair. [[01:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=4362.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=4365.68s)]
*  But you know, but it's a different style. It's a different, you know, okay. [[01:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=4366.68s)]
*  This person's not a bluegrass musician. They're a dancer or they're a, you know, a rapper or whatever. [[01:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=4370.68s)]
*  That auto tune sound is a stylistic. It's a part of the sound. [[01:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=4375.68s)]
*  You know, it's like a banjo is to bluegrass, you know. [[01:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=4380.68s)]
*  Right. They're almost like new, new orchestra. Yeah. It's like, it used to have be this guy was the guy who was like the DJ. [[01:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=4383.68s)]
*  You know, nobody ever gives that guy credit. [[01:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=4390.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=4392.68s)]
*  You know, for being the first fucking Zed or whatever. [[01:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=4393.68s)]
*  Conductor. Yeah. [[01:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=4395.68s)]
*  Yeah. The conductor. Nobody's like, oh, look at that. There's cascade. [[01:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=4396.68s)]
*  You know, they're just like, oh, look at this penguin fucking guy with the two sticks. [[01:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=4399.68s)]
*  You know, this guy's obviously a fucking dork. [[01:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=4403.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=4405.68s)]
*  But truly that guy was the fuck. That guy was the cascade. That guy was. He was the G man. [[01:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=4406.68s)]
*  He was the chain smokers. You know, it was just a different time. [[01:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=4412.68s)]
*  And then now people use more auto tune. They just had an article the other day. [[01:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=4416.68s)]
*  It was about like T pain. Did you see? [[01:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=4420.68s)]
*  I remember like hearing him talk about, I don't remember what show it was on or something, but he was talking about how Usher or somebody told him that he like ruined music by introducing all that auto tune shit. [[01:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=4422.68s)]
*  And he said he got like really depressed about it. [[01:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=4434.68s)]
*  Oh, wow. Like the I'm on a boat. [[01:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=4437.68s)]
*  Well, I don't know. I'm on a boat. [[01:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=4439.68s)]
*  Wasn't he? Didn't he make that song? [[01:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=4442.68s)]
*  I think so. But either way, like, I feel like that was his sound was the real auto tune and stuff. [[01:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=4444.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=4448.68s)]
*  And and I think somebody who he really looked up to told him that he was like, yeah, Usher told him that he ruined music that Usher telling him he ruined music led to a four year depression. [[01:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=4449.68s)]
*  But I guess and then you see T pain coming out singing these Chris Stapleton songs and shit. [[01:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=4462.68s)]
*  And it's like this motherfucker can sing. [[01:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=4466.68s)]
*  Yeah. It's like if anybody was using he was the last person that should have been pressing the button. [[01:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=4469.68s)]
*  Right. But I mean, that's what I'm saying is like it's a stylistic choice. [[01:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=4474.68s)]
*  It's like it's not like the guy can't fucking sing. [[01:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=4477.68s)]
*  Oh, I see what you're saying. [[01:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=4479.68s)]
*  So you're saying that, yes, sometimes in the instance, it's an instance of somebody just trying something new, trying a different style, seeing what else is going on as opposed to somebody just not having a certain skill set. [[01:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=4480.68s)]
*  Like, check this out, man. [[01:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=4492.68s)]
*  Like Post Malone, for instance, like that's my dog. [[01:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=4493.68s)]
*  And he, you know, he uses a lot of auto tune on his like rap music and what I mean, whatever music I can't. [[01:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=4496.68s)]
*  How do you even classify his music? [[01:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=4504.68s)]
*  It's just like posty music. [[01:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=4506.68s)]
*  Well, he's a concierge of joy. [[01:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=4507.68s)]
*  I think is honestly how I would how I would I've only hung out with him once, but he is a fucking best dude ever. [[01:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=4509.68s)]
*  But the first time I really fucking care bear. [[01:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=4517.68s)]
*  I love him. [[01:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=4520.68s)]
*  Yeah. But the first time I met him, he invited me over to his place or whatever. [[01:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=4521.68s)]
*  And we fucking sat there and saying Johnny Cash, Hank Williams, fucking he knows more old country songs than I do, I think. [[01:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=4528.68s)]
*  And he can play them on guitar and sing them like a fucking angel. [[01:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=4537.68s)]
*  And it's like I'm sitting in a room with him watching this like, OK, like dudes talented. [[01:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=4540.68s)]
*  Like, I'm fucking impressed. [[01:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=4546.68s)]
*  He knows the words to more Hank Williams songs than me. [[01:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=4548.68s)]
*  I'm like, holy shit. [[01:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=4551.68s)]
*  I mean, it's like the same thing with like Luke Combs when I was in a room with him for the first time and he opened his mouth and started singing. [[01:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=4552.68s)]
*  I'm just like, wow. [[01:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=4558.68s)]

*  And I'm just like honored to be around any of these these guys. [[01:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=4564.68s)]
*  I mean, and especially more than even those cats who are big celebrities. [[01:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=4568.68s)]
*  The Jack Pearsons and more of the guys who are in my scene, the Bela Flex, the Brian Sutton's, the Stuart Duncan's, the Jerry Douglas's. [[01:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=4573.68s)]

*  And it was just a tour that you did. [[01:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=4612.68s)]
*  Sorry. [[01:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=4613.68s)]

*  And you just featured like, yeah, because it's so it's so the spinning wheel of luck and fortune sometimes that some voices get heard louder than others, you know. [[01:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=4617.68s)]
*  And then some people don't want to be the center of attention also as well. [[01:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=4630.68s)]
*  I had I still have a hard time with success. [[01:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=4633.68s)]
*  I grew up. [[01:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=4638.68s)]
*  The opposite. [[01:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=4641.68s)]
*  I grew up poor. [[01:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=4642.68s)]
*  I grew up, you know, going to stay the night at friends houses just so I could have some dinner. [[01:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=4643.68s)]

*  So I have a hard time with success because all my people are still living that, you know, back home. [[01:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=4661.68s)]
*  I have people that are still going to prison, still addicted, still dying from ODs, you know, and I'm sitting over here shitting on a heated toilet at the Sunset Marquis. [[01:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=4667.68s)]
*  And it's like, well, why me? [[01:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=4677.68s)]

*  It's like so I've talked to my therapist about this a bunch, you know, and I'm going, OK, well, I go stand on stage and play guitar. [[01:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=4685.68s)]
*  Now, granted, I've worked I've played guitar since I was four years old and I've worked very hard at it. [[01:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=4692.68s)]
*  You know, I mean, this is twenty five years of fucking playing every day, you know, trying to get better and really wanting to be a musician since I was in kindergarten, you know, like since I was a baby. [[01:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=4698.68s)]
*  And but still, when I'm at my house and we like are doing some renovations or something and I see some like Mexican dude out and working on laying the asphalt or something and I'm going he's out in the hot sun. [[01:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=4710.68s)]

*  You know, but she also said she told me about this pyramid of competence. [[01:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=4762.68s)]
*  It's like as a musician goes, well, how many guitar players do you know? [[01:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=4768.68s)]
*  How many do you know that can play and sing at the same time? [[01:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=4773.68s)]
*  How many do you know that play, sing at the same time and write their own songs? [[01:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=4777.68s)]

*  It starts getting narrowed down. [[01:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=4794.68s)]
*  And I'm just the crazy motherfucker that will die for this shit. [[01:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=4797.68s)]

*  I play for my life. [[01:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=4803.68s)]
*  Like I'm not it's not a job. [[01:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=4804.68s)]
*  It's not a this is my fucking survival, you know, and this is it's literally everything to me. [[01:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=4807.68s)]
*  So I think even going back to the fact that when you were high on a drug, you reached for your guitar. [[01:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=4814.68s)]
*  I've always reached for my I know that but it's the same. [[01:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=4822.68s)]
*  It's a survive. [[01:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=4825.68s)]
*  Like it just I'm just thinking of that. [[01:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=4826.68s)]
*  I'm not trying to like link this shit. [[01:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=4827.68s)]
*  No, it's just my guitar has always been my best friend and my coping mechanism through everything. [[01:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=4828.68s)]
*  Right. And here's what's crazy though. [[01:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=4833.68s)]
*  Billy is people are going to do all have to do jobs. [[01:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=4835.68s)]
*  I remember working at a pizza place and I would listen to the second the boss would leave. [[01:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=4838.68s)]
*  I would turn up fucking guns and roses and I would fucking hell right. [[01:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=4842.68s)]
*  Oh, dude, I would fucking cry in there listening to November rain and fucking threaten other people that worked at the place. [[01:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=4847.68s)]
*  And I would I would drink beer back there. [[01:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=4853.68s)]
*  I would open up the deep fryers, dude, and I would put pudding in there. [[01:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=4856.68s)]
*  I put pepper. [[01:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=4860.68s)]
*  I put anything you could fucking fried and eat it and drink beer. [[01:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=4861.68s)]
*  And and but that what I'm saying is sometimes that person is listening to your music and it's what's making the shift a little bit shorter. [[01:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=4864.68s)]
*  It's what's keeping there. [[01:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=4873.68s)]
*  So it's like we all like think are part of some process where it's like, you know, I remember working on a farm for a couple of summers and having to do 14 hour days. [[01:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=4875.68s)]
*  And oh my God. [[01:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=4884.68s)]
*  But I would listen to Bailin Hayer. [[01:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=4885.68s)]
*  What were you doing? [[01:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=4887.68s)]
*  No, I was running fertilizer running, just help cleaning like the frogs on the planters like they let me plant after a while. [[01:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=4888.68s)]
*  I broke some shit. [[01:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=4897.68s)]
*  I probably still need to hard work. [[01:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=4898.68s)]
*  I got to resent or get an as for a men's. [[01:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=4900.68s)]
*  But yeah, but it was I just did whatever needed to be done. [[01:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=4902.68s)]
*  But I would park. [[01:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=4905.68s)]
*  I remember this. [[01:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=4907.68s)]
*  I would park that tractor sometimes. [[01:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=4908.68s)]
*  I would just park it because I'd be in like 300 acres. [[01:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=4910.68s)]
*  There'd be nobody around. [[01:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=4913.68s)]
*  I parked that tractor. [[01:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=4914.68s)]
*  I'd stand out on the fucking hood of that thing. [[01:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=4915.68s)]
*  And I would play like I would play just the top 10 country. [[01:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=4917.68s)]
*  It didn't get that they even had an old radio and they didn't even see. [[01:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=4923.68s)]
*  But you knew the channel and I would just sing the fucking songs. [[01:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=4927.68s)]
*  It was like the one moment I had during the day that made me feel good or not that made me feel good, but that just fucking let it all out. [[01:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=4931.68s)]
*  Right. And somebody who would probably play those songs had maybe done a job that I'd done. [[01:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=4939.68s)]
*  I remember I worked as a pipe at a pipefitter's place over there in New Orleans over in Destrehan or something. [[01:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=4943.68s)]
*  And we would play that song. [[01:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=4949.68s)]
*  I just want to fly. [[01:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=4952.68s)]
*  Remember that song? [[01:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=4955.68s)]
*  Put you on. [[01:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=4956.68s)]
*  And it was just kind of a groove. [[01:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=4957.68s)]
*  It was one of those songs that hung around for so long in the ether. [[01:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=4958.68s)]
*  They kind of overplayed it and shit for sure. [[01:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=4961.68s)]
*  And they started playing it at CVS and people wanted to kill themselves and shit. [[01:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=4963.68s)]
*  But for the first the younger guys who were like the guys who would just go sit out in the sun and we would paint the glue one of the pipes so they could fit the rubber in there so that the hold wouldn't like crack the pipe and stuff. [[01:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=4966.68s)]
*  Whenever that song came on, we had to go in and dance for the other guys who've been working there for a long time. [[01:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=4982.68s)]
*  These welders, dude, and they fucking hated it. [[01:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=4988.68s)]
*  But we go in and it was this one fun moment we had during the day that was just ours. [[01:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=4990.68s)]
*  Nobody knew about it in the universe. [[01:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=4995.68s)]
*  And these fuck it. [[01:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=4997.68s)]
*  The first day none of them even look up from their like welding and shit. [[01:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=4998.68s)]
*  But by the third day they were like these motherfuckers. [[01:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=5002.68s)]
*  And it was kind of like it was almost like us like hazing ourselves in order to be accepted by the other group. [[01:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=5004.68s)]
*  That's great. [[01:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=5011.68s)]
*  But I think it's just because of music. [[01:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=5012.68s)]
*  We wouldn't if that song never comes on and it's just we never would have done it. [[01:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=5015.68s)]
*  You know, it's just like there's certain things that it does help. [[01:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=5019.68s)]
*  So I see what you're saying, man. [[01:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=5023.68s)]
*  There's times I like get off stage and I'm walking past like the people, the employees that are help cleaning up the stands. [[01:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=5025.68s)]
*  And I feel bad for everybody, dude. [[01:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=5032.68s)]
*  Always is it that you and I want to think about this with you right now. [[01:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=5034.68s)]
*  Man, do you think it's that you that you feel bad or do you feel? [[01:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=5038.68s)]
*  Well, I just feel like why do why should I have it better than anybody else ever for anything? [[01:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=5043.68s)]
*  Right. Why should there be anybody out there who's struggling, who's sad, who doesn't have a roof over their heads and I do? [[01:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=5049.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=5055.68s)]
*  Just like we're all the same, you know, I'm not better than anybody else. [[01:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=5056.68s)]
*  Right. [[01:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=5060.68s)]
*  I think it's that you got chosen to be a some semblance of and we all get chosen at certain moments, I think, to be some semblance of hope. [[01:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=5061.68s)]
*  That's what I think. [[01:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=5068.68s)]
*  Because that's the thing. [[01:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=5069.68s)]
*  I hear your story, man. [[01:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=5071.68s)]
*  I think about like it reminds me of certain things in my own life. [[01:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=5072.68s)]
*  It reminds you of people that I know. [[01:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=5075.68s)]
*  And then when I hear your music, I'm like, man, this makes me believe that something could be different for me, that something could be different for my son, for my daughter, for an in law. [[01:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=5078.68s)]
*  It gives me hope. [[01:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=5092.68s)]
*  It gives me hope. [[01:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=5093.68s)]
*  And so but I think it is hard to hard to accept that that that you're going to be a beacon of hope in some way. [[01:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=5094.68s)]
*  But I think we're all beacons of hope in a different moments for each other. [[01:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=5102.68s)]
*  You know, like I'll have some people call into the podcast sometime and tell me a guy called in the other day and he said that he's like, hey, man, a few years ago I called in and I was going through a divorce and I was heartbroken. [[01:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=5106.68s)]
*  And I just want to call today. [[01:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=5117.68s)]
*  It's three years later and my new wife and I are expecting our first born child and it just like turned around for him. [[01:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=5118.68s)]
*  And in that moment, dude, that guy was my fucking hero. [[01:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=5126.68s)]
*  That guy was my Tom Brady. [[01:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=5129.68s)]
*  When I listen to that, totally. [[01:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=5130.68s)]
*  It was like, so I think there's all like, I don't know, and my son to preach you, man. [[01:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=5132.68s)]
*  No. Yeah, I just think that. [[01:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=5137.68s)]
*  Yeah, I think that like you just never. [[01:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=5138.68s)]
*  We're all just taking turns. [[01:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=5141.68s)]
*  I think we're all just taking turns. [[01:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=5142.68s)]
*  And you worked so hard at the fucking music, you know, you worked hard at it. [[01:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=5144.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=5148.68s)]
*  And it's the best reward that I could ever receive is somebody saying, hey, man, your song helped me through a tough time or something. [[01:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=5149.68s)]
*  And I've got that a bunch. [[01:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=5156.68s)]
*  And it's just the best thing ever. [[01:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=5157.68s)]
*  Better than any accolade, better than any, you know, anything like that. [[01:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=5160.68s)]
*  It's just the fact that, you know, and my songs have some of them have helped me. [[01:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=5165.68s)]
*  I've written songs that. [[01:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=5172.68s)]
*  Like, I wrote the song and I thought I was writing it for other people to hear and that I feel like what they need. [[01:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=5173.68s)]
*  Then I sing it for a couple of months on stage and one night on stage, I'm singing the words and I'm going, oh, my God, I wrote this for me. [[01:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=5180.68s)]
*  Like, I'm the one that needs to hear this message. [[01:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=5187.68s)]
*  Wow. [[01:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=5189.68s)]
*  You know, it's just like, holy shit. [[01:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=5190.68s)]
*  That's crazy. [[01:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=5193.68s)]
*  Yeah, I think we're all like instruments of a higher power, you know, and I do. [[01:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=5195.68s)]
*  I just yeah, we just don't know how we're being used. [[01:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=5199.68s)]
*  It's funny, man. [[01:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=5202.68s)]
*  I'll get home and I'll be tired or whatever. [[01:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=5203.68s)]
*  I mean, everybody's fucking tired and shit. [[01:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=5205.68s)]
*  But I'll go to the airport now. [[01:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=5208.68s)]
*  And sometimes the airport, you still see somebody waiting for their kid to come home from the military or waiting for a boyfriend or girlfriend. [[01:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=5209.68s)]
*  Or you'll still you'll see a guy out there with flowers waiting to see his wife. [[01:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=5215.68s)]
*  And that guy or person or family is my like they are my damn Frederick Douglass. [[01:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=5218.68s)]
*  You know, like they fucking that's like they're my whatever they you know, I don't even know their name and they are like my Mozart for the month. [[01:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=5225.68s)]
*  Just seeing that there's like pieces of excitement and hope. [[01:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=5235.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=5240.68s)]
*  Anyway, but what do you what do you think? [[01:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=5241.68s)]
*  Do you think there's something do you think there's like a illness in America or in our culture that because we go through a lot of cities and towns and it's like, [[01:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=5245.68s)]
*  you start to feel like there's an energy missing from the culture. [[01:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=5254.68s)]
*  Do you feel that at all? [[01:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=5258.68s)]
*  Or do you think that's just I don't know what it is, man. [[01:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=5259.68s)]
*  I mean, I don't know shit. [[01:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=5263.68s)]
*  I just mean, I know none of us do. [[01:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=5264.68s)]
*  We can just sit here and bullshit about it. [[01:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=5267.68s)]
*  But I don't know. [[01:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=5269.68s)]
*  I feel like people are just cruel to each other. [[01:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=5270.68s)]
*  You know, and but it's also not in real life like online. [[01:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=5274.68s)]
*  They are. [[01:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=5279.68s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[01:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=5280.68s)]
*  Online is crazy. [[01:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=5281.68s)]
*  But I'm just saying like at the height of the, you know, political tensions and stuff like that, like a couple of years ago with Trump and everything, it's like you just go online and you see everybody just, you know, talking shit to each other. [[01:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=5282.68s)]
*  But then you look up from your phone and you're in the airport and nobody's doing that. [[01:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=5297.68s)]
*  And it's like, well, wait a minute. [[01:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=5301.68s)]
*  Like, are you guys actually enemies or are you guys just doing this online? [[01:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=5302.68s)]
*  Because you're all here in the same airport and nobody's saying shit. [[01:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=5306.68s)]
*  So what the fuck? [[01:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=5310.68s)]
*  You know, it's like I feel like the Internet just spews and breeds like hatred like that. [[01:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=5311.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=5317.68s)]
*  OK. [[01:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=5318.68s)]
*  Not the Internet, maybe like social media or whatever. [[01:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=5319.68s)]
*  But I just feel like it's just some it's great for some things and it's not so good for other things. [[01:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=5321.68s)]
*  You know, I wouldn't say something maybe to your face that I would say online or whatever. [[01:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=5329.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=5336.68s)]
*  Oh, death. [[01:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=5337.68s)]
*  I think there's things you can comment like that is easier. [[01:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=5338.68s)]
*  But is it different to hear it? [[01:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=5343.68s)]
*  You know, let's say I wouldn't stare you in the eyes and say you're a fucking piece of shit, you know. [[01:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=5345.68s)]
*  But if I said that online and you receive it, is it any different than me actually saying it to you? [[01:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=5350.68s)]
*  Well, it's interesting. [[01:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=5355.68s)]
*  Because when you read it, you're still OK, this person thinks I'm a piece of shit. [[01:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=5356.68s)]
*  What the fuck? [[01:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=5361.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=5363.68s)]
*  Yeah, that's interesting. [[01:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=5364.68s)]
*  I think it's definitely not good. [[01:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=5365.68s)]
*  I'm amazed that we allow it to happen to our culture like or that we allow like you would think there would be a governing entity. [[01:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=5367.68s)]
*  And maybe I don't understand government sometimes or something that would say, hey, this isn't good for us. [[01:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=5377.68s)]
*  We'll allow it during, you know, maybe you allow it during certain hours of the day. [[01:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=5383.68s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[01:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=5387.68s)]
*  Or I would. It's the same like with the opiates. [[01:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=5388.68s)]
*  It's like, hey, a company that is fucking killing people, that is people selling their grandmothers in like third generation egg beater to cop a pill. [[01:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=5390.68s)]
*  Hey, you're not good for us. [[01:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=5401.68s)]
*  You know, like it would just think like good for the economy. [[01:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=5403.68s)]
*  Right. But it's like, at what point does that even have any? [[01:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=5407.68s)]
*  Because people are sick. I don't even think we're sick on the outside. [[01:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=5410.68s)]
*  I feel like our souls are sick and we're out here having to like take care of them. [[01:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=5413.68s)]
*  That's why people need to listen to more bluegrass. [[01:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=5417.68s)]
*  Here we go. [[01:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=5419.68s)]
*  You know, that's probably the truth. [[01:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=5420.68s)]
*  It really is, man. [[01:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=5422.68s)]
*  Well, look, the power of music, man. [[01:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=5423.68s)]
*  The power of music. [[01:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=5425.68s)]
*  Dude, if I had to work all day and listen to no music, I mean, when when enslaved times, they sang, they made beautiful fucking music to get them through. [[01:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=5427.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=5436.68s)]
*  And the prison lines to them guys out there hammering away and shit them songs, man. [[01:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=5437.68s)]
*  Oh, yeah, I saw this. [[01:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=5442.68s)]
*  Here's this is this is pretty captivating. [[01:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=5444.68s)]
*  A dying mom blown away after she creates final song for her son and it makes the Billboard charts. [[01:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=5447.68s)]
*  This is really cool. [[01:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=5452.68s)]
*  This is Kat Janis, I think. [[01:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=5454.68s)]
*  Yeah. Thirty one year old Kat Janis noticed a lump on her neck in twenty twenty one that doctors diagnosed as sarcoma, a rare type of tumor that collects within the bone and tissue and is also no joke. [[01:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=5455.68s)]
*  I went to school with a guy named Sarcoma Jackson growing up and fucking William Pitcher, Jr. High School. [[01:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=5469.68s)]
*  Move on, though. [[01:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=5474.68s)]
*  What else did it say about her on that article? [[01:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=5475.68s)]
*  Kat was declared cancer free after undergoing treatment, but the cancer sadly returned in June twenty twenty three, this time in her lungs. [[01:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=5480.68s)]
*  One of the ways in which Kat coped with diagnosis is through music. [[01:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=5487.68s)]
*  In a video she valiantly shared to social media after finding out her most recent diagnosis, she said, I'm going to go back into treatment. [[01:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=5491.68s)]
*  I'm going to be really strong about it. [[01:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=5499.68s)]
*  The mother posted an update to her health back in January to her followers. [[01:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=5501.68s)]
*  January 10th, twenty twenty four. [[01:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=5504.68s)]
*  The tumor is basically tripled overnight. [[01:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=5506.68s)]
*  Oh, she's in hospice now. [[01:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=5508.68s)]
*  Oh, she says she's going to make. [[01:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=5510.68s)]
*  She told the publication that she signed her entire discography over to her son and added she wanted to release one final track. [[01:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=5513.68s)]
*  And this is the track, I guess, that's been blowing up. [[01:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=5518.68s)]
*  Wow. [[01:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=5521.68s)]
*  It's cool, man. [[01:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=5522.68s)]
*  I have to check it out. [[01:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=5523.68s)]
*  Actually, you can probably play, play like a play a little bit of it. [[01:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=5524.68s)]
*  So when you hear this cat Janice. [[01:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=5527.68s)]
*  Oh, let's go Kat Janice, baby. [[01:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=5557.68s)]
*  I like it, bro. [[01:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=5586.68s)]
*  I do. [[01:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=5587.68s)]
*  That's exciting, man. [[01:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=5588.68s)]
*  And what a neat thing just to be able to have it. [[01:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=5590.68s)]
*  I can't believe it's interesting. [[01:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=5592.68s)]
*  You know, I think that shows you people want to like support things that make them feel something. [[01:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=5594.68s)]
*  You know, people know she's making that song. [[01:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=5598.68s)]
*  She has a son. [[01:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=5601.68s)]
*  They think about it, you know, I can't imagine you're in hospice and that happens. [[01:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=5603.68s)]
*  It's got to just keep you. [[01:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=5608.68s)]
*  Well, it's like what I was talking about earlier. [[01:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=5610.68s)]
*  You know how the music was like rock and roll and then hippies wanted acoustic music and then it got back into like some heavy stuff in the 70s and then disco happened. [[01:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=5614.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=5626.68s)]
*  And then eventually people were like, OK, enough of disco. [[01:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=5627.68s)]
*  Like let's and then grunge and then, you know, like 90s. [[01:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=5630.68s)]
*  Yesterday. [[01:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=5635.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=5636.68s)]
*  And then and then now it's been kind of like electronic music and hip hop has been sort of like reigning supreme. [[01:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=5637.68s)]
*  And I think people are just they like to hear a guy strumming a guitar again or playing drums, you know, or sitting there playing an instrument and singing. [[01:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=5644.68s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=5654.68s)]
*  We want something real. [[01:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=5655.68s)]
*  Yeah. I want something real. [[01:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=5657.68s)]
*  I think that's I just I want to see. [[01:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=5658.68s)]
*  I want to fucking see something that means something to somebody. [[01:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=5660.68s)]
*  I don't want something that feels like it's, you know, I don't know, contrived for. [[01:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=5663.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=5668.68s)]
*  Yes. [[01:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=5669.68s)]
*  You know, I'm just I think part of me is tired of feeling tricked. [[01:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=5670.68s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, it's kind of like an addicted to the tricks. [[01:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=5674.68s)]
*  Well, you know, when you take away all the stuff that I mean, I want to use all of the technology I can to make music, at least that my peers are. [[01:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=5678.68s)]
*  It seems like every time we get into a studio with a producer or something, because we're a bluegrass band, they go, oh, man, we're going to record you straight to tape. [[01:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=5689.68s)]
*  And it's going to, you know, super old school, like it's the fifties or something. [[01:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=5698.68s)]
*  I'm going, well, fuck, man, all my peers are using auto tune and shit. [[01:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=5701.68s)]
*  This ain't fair. Like, right. [[01:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=5705.68s)]
*  So it's like we kind of want one thing, but then we also want to we want to use the things that can help us. [[01:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=5706.68s)]
*  Yeah, for sure. [[01:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=5711.68s)]
*  So I'm just like, you know, what do you do? [[01:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=5712.68s)]
*  But when you kind of take all that stuff away and just hear a song that's just like a guy strumming a guitar and singing something that means something, I think it's just I don't know. [[01:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=5715.68s)]
*  It's more pure or something. [[01:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=5729.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=5731.68s)]

*  Yeah. Can we listen a little bit? [[01:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=5759.68s)]
*  Can you just play it for us if we put these back on? [[01:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=5760.68s)]
*  I want to hear a little bit of this. [[01:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=5763.68s)]
*  Dude, that's cool, man. [[01:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=5767.68s)]
*  It just looks fun. [[01:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=5768.68s)]
*  Yeah. He just hit me up and was like, man, come on. [[01:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=5770.68s)]
*  And then we were just hanging. [[01:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=5772.68s)]
*  I was like, you want to come sing one? [[01:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=5773.68s)]

*  I respect that. [[01:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=5795.68s)]
*  It's like when you're a comedy and somebody puts their feet up on the stage in the front. [[01:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=5798.68s)]
*  Dude, where the fuck did that shirt go? [[01:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=5802.68s)]

*  Dude, I think it's just I think, well, that's the thing. [[01:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=5838.68s)]
*  It's like I think one reason people love musicians is just you can make something that makes people feel good pretty quick. [[01:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=5840.68s)]
*  You're like a drug. [[01:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=5848.68s)]
*  You know, you're a drug. [[01:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=5850.68s)]
*  It's a damn drug, dude. [[01:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=5852.68s)]
*  You know, when I was getting my wisdom tooth pulled out, I was all I don't know. [[01:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=5853.68s)]
*  No, I wasn't nitrous either. [[01:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=5861.68s)]
*  I think they knocked me out. [[01:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=5864.68s)]
*  When I came back to I was all kind of loopy or something. [[01:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=5865.68s)]
*  But either way, I was like getting super sentimental and like emotional about there was this this woman, this endodontist or whatever. [[01:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=5868.68s)]
*  You know, and I was like, oh, my God, you've literally for one thing, I fucking hated school. [[01:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=5876.68s)]
*  You went to more school so that you could help people. [[01:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=5884.68s)]
*  That is so noble. [[01:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=5891.68s)]
*  You literally went to more school, which is like the worst fucking shit in the world. [[01:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=5894.68s)]
*  Just so that you could help people in their life and help people with their face and their teeth. [[01:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=5901.68s)]
*  Like, oh, my God, thank you. [[01:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=5906.68s)]
*  You know. [[01:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=5909.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=5913.68s)]
*  No, look, that's true. [[01:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=5914.68s)]
*  Yes. [[01:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=5916.68s)]
*  So those are perspective. [[01:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=5917.68s)]
*  I just got to have a good perspective. [[01:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=5918.68s)]
*  It's like, thank you for I mean, you put in the work, a doctor or something like that. [[01:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=5920.68s)]
*  I mean, a musician to a chef. [[01:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=5925.68s)]
*  Fuck, this motherfucker spent all this time learning how to brew this beer that tastes so good now or whatever. [[01:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=5927.68s)]
*  It's like, thank you. [[01:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=5934.68s)]
*  Yeah, I wouldn't think of a chef as somebody making beer immediately, but I respect. [[01:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=5935.68s)]
*  Well, no, a brewer, a chef, an artist. [[01:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=5939.68s)]
*  Yes. [[01:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=5942.68s)]
*  A fucking, you know, if you're going to like a five star restaurant. [[01:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=5943.68s)]
*  I made this beer and the steak's good too, man. [[01:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=5947.68s)]
*  God damn. [[01:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=5950.68s)]
*  Yeah, I like a medium pale ale. [[01:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=5952.68s)]
*  Medium rare for me. [[01:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=5955.68s)]
*  Keep mine a little bloody. [[01:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=5957.68s)]
*  But no, it's like. [[01:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=5960.68s)]
*  No, you're right, man. [[01:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=5961.68s)]
*  Respecting the artistry that people put into things. [[01:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=5962.68s)]
*  And even as a thing like a chef, I think they're, you know, because some chefs, they love being chefs, man. [[01:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=5965.68s)]
*  I talked to my buddy Brad last night. [[01:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=5971.68s)]
*  He's a chef in Nashville. [[01:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=5973.68s)]
*  He loves being a chef. [[01:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=5974.68s)]
*  He's talking about he's just excited about it. [[01:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=5976.68s)]
*  And yeah, I find that thing you love, man. [[01:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=5978.68s)]
*  Respecting the artistry of things. [[01:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=5981.68s)]
*  Respect for the craft. [[01:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=5983.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=5984.68s)]
*  My buddy, Corey Wong was telling me that he was on tour somewhere over and I don't know, but they met this cheese maker. [[01:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=5985.68s)]
*  This fucking guy who was all about cheese. [[01:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=5993.68s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[01:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=5995.68s)]
*  And so they were trying all these different cheeses and shit. [[01:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=5996.68s)]
*  And at the end of it, they were like, OK, well, we want to take some to go. [[01:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=5998.68s)]
*  And they were like trying to figure out where to how to package it. [[01:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=6002.68s)]
*  And Corey's like, well, we can just all put it in one bag. [[01:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=6005.68s)]
*  And the cheese maker was like, no, like respect for the craft, dog. [[01:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=6008.68s)]
*  We ain't putting mixing up the cheeses. [[01:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=6012.68s)]
*  They all go in their own container. [[01:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=6014.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=6016.68s)]
*  Gorgonzola, first of all, has been in solitary confinement for a couple of weeks. [[01:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=6017.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=6020.68s)]
*  We're nice. Yeah. [[01:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=6021.68s)]
*  I mean, he's not allowed to be around the other inmates already. [[01:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=6022.68s)]
*  So yeah, no, it's a good point. [[01:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=6025.68s)]
*  Respecting the craft of things. [[01:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=6028.68s)]
*  And I think that goes back to some things in our society, bro. [[01:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=6030.68s)]
*  And I talk about this kind of stuff a lot because I think it's been I'm wondering why there's so much addiction and stuff in the world and why people are sick or what is sick inside of us. [[01:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=6034.68s)]
*  And I think one thing that people need to have is purpose. [[01:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=6044.68s)]
*  And I think people used to feel more purpose when they had like you knew who the guy in your town was that was like own the wood shop and was the woodworker. [[01:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=6047.68s)]
*  Or, you know, you knew who was the cheese maker who made the best pastries. [[01:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=6056.68s)]
*  When life was like Mayberry. [[01:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=6061.68s)]
*  When it was just a little bit more like unindustrial, like unmass. [[01:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=6063.68s)]
*  Where just where everything wasn't a Krispy Kreme. [[01:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=6070.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=6072.68s)]
*  And yeah, it's not a exactly because then it was like I got to go. [[01:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=6073.68s)]
*  I know the baker, dude, I can learn from the baker and the baker felt value in the town because he can share information. [[01:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=6076.68s)]
*  And it came from his grandparents. [[01:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=6082.68s)]
*  And so then your grandparents had value and there was lineage. [[01:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=6083.68s)]
*  And like, I think that things like that were important. [[01:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=6086.68s)]
*  And now you go through a lot of cities and towns in America and there's there's not a lot of that. [[01:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=6090.68s)]
*  I think that's, you know, not to just tie everything to bluegrass music, but I think that's part of the reason why people love bluegrass music is it's almost a tap back into that world before all of the industrialization. [[01:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=6096.68s)]
*  Like when people were sitting on their porch picking and you knew the neighbor and they came down for dinner and Floyd cut everybody's hair and Andy Griffith was the sheriff. [[01:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=6111.68s)]
*  And, you know, I was like simpler times, really. [[01:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=6121.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=6125.68s)]
*  Did our bus driver gave everybody same cut, dude. [[01:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=6126.68s)]
*  R.I.P. Ray. [[01:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=6129.68s)]
*  I don't know what his name was. [[01:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=6131.68s)]
*  Deceased Ray, I guess they call him now or whatever. [[01:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=6134.68s)]
*  But he was our bus driver and also had the barber shop in town and it was like the red and white barber pole and everybody went in there. [[01:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=6136.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=6144.68s)]
*  And you'd wait. [[01:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=6145.68s)]
*  You have to go if you knew if you didn't get there early. [[01:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=6146.68s)]
*  It was like three, three twenty five or something. [[01:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=6147.68s)]
*  But on the bus days and once a month he would cut on the bus. [[01:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=6149.68s)]
*  And so he would cut everybody's hair. [[01:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=6152.68s)]
*  It was like two dollars, bro. [[01:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=6155.68s)]
*  Everybody got same haircut. [[01:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=6156.68s)]
*  Man, woman, down syndrome, whatever you had. [[01:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=6158.68s)]
*  Everybody got the same exact cut on that bitch. [[01:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=6162.68s)]
*  You roll. [[01:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=6164.68s)]
*  We all had the same cut in town. [[01:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=6165.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=6168.68s)]
*  So it's kind of those are the echelons. [[01:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=6169.68s)]
*  If you went and got it cut actually at the shop or if you got one of those bus cuts, Ray would just rattle people off. [[01:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=6171.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=6177.68s)]
*  Got the old bus cut. [[01:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=6178.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=6179.68s)]
*  It was a different time. [[01:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=6180.68s)]
*  Rattling Ray. [[01:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=6181.68s)]
*  Dude, you've gotten to do so much with music, man. [[01:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=6182.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=6184.68s)]
*  I think what I was asking about was sitting there with the with your parents was just that energy when you're sitting there waiting to get called. [[01:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=6185.68s)]
*  That's almost the most exciting thing. [[01:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=6191.68s)]
*  Whether you win or not. [[01:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=6193.68s)]
*  It's just that that's really that's the coolest is just being in that moment where there's possibility. [[01:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=6194.68s)]

*  Dude. [[01:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=7025.68s)]
*  Oh, one question I had. [[01:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=7026.68s)]
*  Oh, is there something on your mind? [[01:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=7027.68s)]
*  Well, no, I was just saying, you know, I've just been working on a record like the last [[01:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=7029.68s)]
*  couple weeks. [[01:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=7034.68s)]
*  We started out in LA working at this studio, and it's just like, I'm kind of at the point [[01:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=7035.68s)]
*  in my career right now where I just don't feel like I need to go into like a big studio [[01:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=7043.68s)]
*  and have all that. [[01:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=7050.68s)]
*  So the last year and a half, I've been sort of building a studio at my house and we just [[01:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=7052.68s)]
*  started cutting there. [[01:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=7060.68s)]
*  We've done two sessions so far. [[01:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=7061.68s)]
*  We were there for like a week and then we were there for like five days. [[01:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=7064.68s)]
*  So I got like 21 new songs in the can that I recorded at home. [[01:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=7067.68s)]
*  And it's so awesome because like, you know, the vibe is so killer there. [[01:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=7075.68s)]
*  We have the whole house and then the studio is just like one little section. [[01:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=7081.68s)]
*  So whenever you're not in the studio, you have a whole house. [[01:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=7085.68s)]
*  Plus, I sort of live out in the country and like we can like ride bikes and stuff while [[01:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=7088.68s)]
*  we're at the studio and like go outside and just, you know, it's just like such a killer [[01:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=7092.68s)]
*  vibe. [[01:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=7097.68s)]
*  So that's what I've been doing the last couple of weeks is working at home and making a record [[01:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=7098.68s)]
*  and it's pretty badass, man. [[01:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=7103.68s)]
*  I'm loving like having my own studio to work at. [[01:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=7105.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=7108.68s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[01:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=7109.68s)]
*  I mean, that's yeah. [[01:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=7110.68s)]
*  And it's one reason why I like having my job here at home. [[01:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=7112.68s)]
*  You know, it's nice to be able to just have your job at home. [[01:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=7115.68s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[01:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=7118.68s)]

*  Oh, in some cultures, yeah. [[01:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=7128.68s)]
*  In Japan, that's considered, I think, a large family. [[01:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=7130.68s)]
*  Right. [[01:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534aXqRMlm8&t=7133.68s)]
