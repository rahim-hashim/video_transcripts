# Thick Upper Crust  This Past Weekend w Theo Von #262
**Theo Von - This Past Weekend:** [February 17, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU)
*  Alright. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=0.0s)]
*  Ooh, it's springtime, baby. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=5.0s)]
*  You know, spring is, um... [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=8.0s)]
*  If you don't know what spring is, [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=12.0s)]
*  it's when winter kind of gets lazy. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=15.0s)]
*  And winter, you know, winter kind of falls asleep at the wheel. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=20.0s)]
*  And spring starts to perk up. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=26.0s)]
*  You know, spring is that time you can hear, um... [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=31.0s)]
*  You could hear flowers start to put deodorant on. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=36.0s)]
*  You know, they're about to... [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=41.0s)]
*  They're thinking about popping back out into the world. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=44.0s)]
*  Showing, just flexing them petals, baby. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=47.0s)]
*  You know, if you put your ear up to the snow right now, [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=51.0s)]
*  you can hear little animals start to yawn a little. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=54.0s)]
*  You might hear a chipmunk do a... [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=60.0s)]
*  He's thinking about popping out and, you know, doing something. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=64.0s)]
*  Maybe looking for a little dipmunk, you know. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=70.0s)]
*  He's thinking, oh, I'm gonna get out, maybe meet me a woman. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=73.0s)]
*  It's that time, almost. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=76.0s)]
*  And that spring, if you think, you know, you can hear... [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=81.0s)]
*  You could hear water start to kind of... [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=85.0s)]
*  You know, you could hear on a mountain, you could hear a mountain, [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=89.0s)]
*  if you put your ear up to a mountain, you could hear it saying, [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=93.0s)]
*  oh, you know what, fuck all these skiers and snowboarders. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=95.0s)]
*  I'm about ready to drip out, make a stream, uh... [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=100.0s)]
*  And do something different. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=105.0s)]
*  That spring, if you look up in the trees, sometimes you could... [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=109.0s)]
*  You'll see a hole in a tree. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=112.0s)]
*  Go peek in there. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=114.0s)]
*  And you'll see a couple of birds in there doing it wildly. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=116.0s)]
*  And doing maybe doggy style or something. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=120.0s)]
*  I don't know if birds do doggy style. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=124.0s)]
*  That seems really... [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=126.0s)]
*  That seems like the dark arts right there. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=128.0s)]
*  But it's that time of year, you'll see a... [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=131.0s)]
*  You'll see an otter kind of getting out of a sleeping bag. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=135.0s)]
*  That's spring, baby, it's here. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=140.0s)]
*  And I'm here. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=142.0s)]
*  And so are you. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=144.0s)]
*  Let's go. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=146.0s)]
*  And that's a little... [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=195.0s)]
*  That's that beautiful diddy. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=216.0s)]
*  That's that beautiful diddy. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=219.0s)]
*  And that's by Tiny Sand Hoo. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=221.0s)]
*  and Tiny Sand who's a, well we don't know what he is. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=224.0s)]
*  Tiny Sand who is a man who makes melodies somewhere [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=228.98s)]
*  in the great beyond and he sent them to me through email. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=233.06s)]
*  And in the old days, now we have email. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=237.56s)]
*  In the old days you may see a donkey come up [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=240.22s)]
*  and a letter will fall off of his back. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=242.64s)]
*  You may have a black raven or something, [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=245.8s)]
*  or a dark bird or something, a flamenco negro [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=249.84s)]
*  fly by and just spit up a secret. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=256.8s)]
*  And that evolved eventually. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=265.64s)]
*  You had the US postal system and everything [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=267.0s)]
*  and now we have email. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=268.76s)]
*  Which when you think about it, email, [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=271.76s)]
*  it's a lot more direct. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=274.88s)]
*  To think that in the old days, [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=277.1s)]
*  if you wanted to send somebody an email, [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=278.54s)]
*  you had to give it to a man who you didn't know, [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=279.98s)]
*  who may have been, who knows doing what. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=285.78000000000003s)]
*  You know, he might have been doing dope, [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=289.1s)]
*  he might have been doing uppers, downers, rounders, [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=290.70000000000005s)]
*  whatever, side splitters, he might have been doing anything. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=294.90000000000003s)]
*  And trust that that bad boy was gonna drop off [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=298.1s)]
*  the things you needed to say to somebody else. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=302.62s)]
*  Geez, that seems old school. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=304.74s)]
*  But now we got email and it's the direct. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=310.74s)]
*  It's basically an electronic system that says, [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=314.28000000000003s)]
*  hey, fuck that other guy that used to run it over there. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=316.6s)]
*  And that is Tiny Sand who sent that in, thank you for that. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=321.48s)]
*  And that was a Valentine's Day hitter he sent us [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=325.8s)]
*  and that's More Than Words. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=329.2s)]
*  That's a cover of the famous song, More Than Words. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=331.96s)]
*  And Tiny also, we'll put a link at the bottom too, [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=337.96s)]
*  you can check out some of his other stuff [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=341.32s)]
*  and other things he sent over the time period [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=342.76s)]
*  of this podcast. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=346.15999999999997s)]
*  And he was a man, he's a secret man, [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=348.32s)]
*  we've never met him, never seen him. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=350.15999999999997s)]
*  And what is he, when you think of a Tiny Sand, [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=352.41999999999996s)]
*  who it could be anything? [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=354.35999999999996s)]
*  It could be a man that's four inches tall [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=356.56s)]
*  and wears Birkenstocks and jumps, [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=359.6s)]
*  and he has a guitar on the ground [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=365.0s)]
*  and he just jumps from chord to chord [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=366.44s)]
*  and does it all with his feet. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=373.04s)]
*  He could be something as secret as that, [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=376.2s)]
*  that's Tiny Sand who. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=378.64s)]

*  We trying to get you to give up big daddy. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=390.98s)]
*  Cause I have more of a body type that's, [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=394.65999999999997s)]
*  I don't know if I have that winter body type. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=396.62s)]
*  You know I got that thick upper crust, [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=400.9s)]

*  everybody knows I got the heart of a lesbian, [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=405.1s)]
*  my father told me that when I was very young [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=406.9s)]
*  and even wrote it one time at a napkin [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=409.36s)]
*  on a bar over there at Tony Padone's bar [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=411.9s)]
*  and over at the Stinkin' Onion, [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=414.94s)]
*  which were a couple of small outfits over there near us [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=416.38s)]
*  in Covington, Louisiana, [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=420.21999999999997s)]
*  he would write it on the napkin [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=421.42s)]
*  to remind me a couple of things about myself [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=423.2s)]
*  I needed to remember. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=425.18s)]
*  And I have also, you know I got just that thick upper, [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=428.5s)]
*  I got that thick, that uproar, that top, that girdle. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=432.94s)]
*  You know I'm front axis. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=437.7s)]
*  I'm two wheel drive and it's, I'm front wheel drive. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=440.6s)]
*  You know if you put my body in the shop, [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=445.08s)]
*  the guy would be like, where the hell is the back wheels? [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=447.2s)]

*  We ain't got them, my torque is up top. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=453.88s)]
*  Cause I have that chest, it looks like if you, [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=457.12s)]
*  look like I took a big inhale and never let it out. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=459.32s)]
*  Like I was smelling something. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=463.46s)]
*  And just never decided what, [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=464.92s)]
*  never could figure out what I smelled. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=470.48s)]
*  And so I've never let it go. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=472.82s)]
*  I've always been like that. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=475.09999999999997s)]
*  I've always had that, just that girthy, [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=476.14s)]
*  that forthright kind of, those tit fields, [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=480.41999999999996s)]
*  you know the chest and the torso. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=484.65999999999997s)]
*  I probably have 60, 70 ribs in me. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=487.5s)]
*  You know I've said it before, [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=491.46s)]
*  but if you beat me open you'll hear, [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=493.02s)]

*  Probably a white guy wearing like a cheetah. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=928.44s)]
*  Or, you know, a couple brothers out there [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=932.16s)]
*  doing something exotic, bro, [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=933.96s)]

*  You're white, you're for everybody. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=953.8s)]

*  kissing, you know, when you kiss somebody. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=998.88s)]

*  against somebody else. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=1004.36s)]
*  And that's, I could only imagine the first time [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=1008.0799999999999s)]
*  somebody said, hey, let me know if you feel anything [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=1012.0999999999999s)]
*  about this. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=1015.6999999999999s)]
*  And then they just did it. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=1017.7399999999999s)]
*  You know, somebody said, hey, let me just put my mouth [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=1020.42s)]
*  against your face or something, or your neck, bruh. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=1023.38s)]
*  And see if you feel something. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=1028.4199999999998s)]

*  I remember one time we went over to the Presbyterian Church [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=1326.26s)]
*  and I told that man, I said, man, [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=1329.58s)]
*  we've been taking these oysters out [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=1330.6999999999998s)]
*  and pretending they were tongues and kissing them, you know? [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=1333.3s)]
*  And that dude, honestly, man, I think, no joke, [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=1337.9399999999998s)]
*  I remember, I think that preacher told me [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=1340.86s)]
*  I was a piece of shit. [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=1342.26s)]
*  But he also, I think he kind of winked at me a little bit. [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=1344.4599999999998s)]
*  So, you know, 50-50. [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=1347.3s)]
*  But that was what we would do. [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=1349.5s)]
*  We would get that oyster and you'd practice [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=1351.58s)]
*  because you could put the oyster in your hand [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=1353.2199999999998s)]
*  like it was a tongue. [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=1356.7399999999998s)]
*  And so you'd throw that oyster in the microwave [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=1359.54s)]
*  for about 11 seconds and get it warm enough, [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=1361.3s)]
*  put it in your hand and you could practice the kissing. [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=1364.3799999999999s)]
*  And God, I mean, it wasn't ideal, [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=1368.54s)]
*  but it was way better than kissing [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=1370.6599999999999s)]
*  on your buddy's neck a little. [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=1373.4599999999998s)]
*  But that was, you remember kissing, practicing kissing? [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=1377.34s)]
*  How'd you practice? [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=1379.7399999999998s)]
*  Hit the hotline, let me know how you practiced kissing. [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=1380.78s)]
*  985-664-9503. [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=1383.5s)]
*  Because we practiced a couple ways, man. [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=1387.66s)]
*  My one friend, he would come over, this boy Jeremy, [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=1389.94s)]
*  and he was born with some different deficiencies, [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=1395.94s)]
*  but he'd pop through and we'd put a bunch of perfume [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=1397.8200000000002s)]
*  on his neck. [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=1401.1000000000001s)]
*  And then kind of practice kissing a little bit. [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=1403.5s)]
*  But not gay, not like in a gay way. [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=1405.74s)]
*  We'd even put a bag over his head and draw like a woman [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=1408.8200000000002s)]
*  on the sides of the bag. [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=1411.1000000000001s)]
*  You know, and you could still smell the perfume [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=1413.98s)]
*  and you could practice, you know, [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=1415.98s)]
*  pretend, oh, hey, Katie, or hey, Charlotte, [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=1417.14s)]
*  you know, hey, Regina, you know, hey, Chondrice, what's up? [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=1420.22s)]
*  And then you could practice, you know, kissing. [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=1426.78s)]
*  But the big thing was to get that oyster [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=1430.34s)]
*  and heat that thing up in the microwave for 11 seconds, [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=1432.7s)]
*  get that thing tongue temperature, [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=1435.5s)]
*  and then you would practice just. [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=1438.1s)]
*  And then. [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=1439.82s)]
*  But man, I remember that being young, bro. [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=1445.1s)]
*  God. [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=1448.54s)]
*  Man, and you just, you just lay, [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=1452.1s)]
*  I remember just laying outdoors sometimes [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=1455.1799999999998s)]
*  and just thinking about all the women [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=1457.6599999999999s)]
*  that probably wanted to have sex with me. [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=1461.06s)]
*  Oh, Jesus Christ. [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=1465.02s)]
*  Anyway, man, we got a lot of calls at, [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=1467.86s)]
*  and a lot of those women, most of those women never, [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=1471.02s)]
*  never really did, bro. [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=1475.54s)]
*  But hey, look, I thought it, man. [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=1477.6999999999998s)]
*  I thought it. [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=1479.86s)]
*  I put the thoughts out there. [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=1480.9799999999998s)]
*  I planted the seeds out into the universe, baby. [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=1483.02s)]
*  It's seeding time. [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=1487.2199999999998s)]

*  Try something different. [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=1493.5s)]
*  Tell somebody, take a chance, you know? [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=1497.26s)]
*  You know, I'm tired in my own life of just, [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=1500.8999999999999s)]
*  I'm tired of sometimes not taking some chances. [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=1504.8999999999999s)]
*  I don't take a lot of chances, really. [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=1507.6999999999998s)]
*  Man, I wanna take some chances. [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=1510.3799999999999s)]

*  and Toronto, the kind of place, great posture. [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=1936.66s)]
*  You see somebody, you barely see them, [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=1940.5800000000002s)]
*  because they're such a straight, [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=1942.18s)]
*  perpendicular, you know, straight vertical. [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=1944.94s)]
*  People constantly, they're forced directly into potholes, [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=1948.1799999999998s)]
*  because they are so, you know, [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=1952.22s)]
*  somebody has a hurt back or one of their arms out [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=1953.9399999999998s)]
*  in a weird way, they hit a, they step in a pothole, [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=1956.1s)]
*  they get caught. [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=1958.6999999999998s)]
*  But with that Toronto posture, baby, [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=1960.34s)]
*  that's disappearing, son. [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=1963.58s)]
*  Disappearing right into the dang bird bath of hell, baby, [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=1966.26s)]

*  And I have a question. [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=1973.82s)]
*  We actually saw you in California in July when I proposed, [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=1976.02s)]
*  and she developed a crush on you. [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=1980.22s)]
*  And I'm worried that when we see you again [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=1983.4199999999998s)]
*  for a real, lengthy troop show, the Dark Arts Tour, [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=1986.6599999999999s)]
*  that she's going to fall in love with you for real, [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=1991.62s)]
*  for real hard. [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=1993.82s)]
*  And I mean, that's a privilege and an honor, [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=1995.02s)]
*  but I mean, I don't know how I'd handle that. [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=1998.3799999999999s)]
*  So if you could let me know. [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=2001.38s)]
*  Anyways, we'll see you in Toronto on the 21st, [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=2003.8600000000001s)]

*  That's a side effect of seeing Papa. [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=2021.0200000000002s)]
*  What I'm gonna do. [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=2024.6200000000001s)]
*  You know, I can't help it if, you know, [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=2026.74s)]

*  And basically Egypt was just the Bible on land. [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=2129.34s)]
*  If you wanna look at it like that. [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=2133.26s)]

*  hot off the Euphrates, dog. [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=2153.38s)]
*  Gang, son, onward. [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=2154.94s)]
*  I was 16, or when I was 17, my mom passed away. [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=2157.34s)]
*  I don't have a family, I never met my dad or anything. [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=2162.2999999999997s)]
*  Oh, I'm sorry to hear that, man. [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=2165.46s)]
*  I'm sorry to hear that, [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=2167.54s)]
*  that that happened to you at such a young age, brother. [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=2170.34s)]
*  Onward. [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=2172.5s)]
*  I've just been on my own since then. [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=2173.98s)]
*  And over that period of time, I've been able to like, [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=2178.02s)]
*  you know, I've been having some ups and downs, you know, [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=2182.82s)]
*  just because of the instability. [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=2185.7400000000002s)]
*  But you know, lately, man, things have been going all right. [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=2187.46s)]
*  You know, I got a girlfriend that I love [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=2189.42s)]
*  and I've got friends around me and it's great, it's great. [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=2191.26s)]
*  But you know, that always gives me worry [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=2194.54s)]
*  because my entire life I've been, [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=2197.1000000000004s)]
*  I've been dealing with, you know, [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=2200.42s)]
*  an anxiety of something's about to go wrong. [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=2202.38s)]
*  So yeah, I just wanted to know what your thought is on that, [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=2206.1800000000003s)]
*  you know, how to keep your mind from telling you [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=2210.14s)]
*  everything's about to blow up. [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=2215.26s)]
*  So, just let it out, man. [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=2216.82s)]
*  I appreciate you, gang, gang. [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=2218.78s)]
*  Gang, bro. [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=2220.54s)]
*  Man, it's so funny that you called him. [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=2222.7000000000003s)]
*  First of all, thank you for calling there, Ramsey's brother. [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=2225.1800000000003s)]
*  And it's so funny you calling to ask about this [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=2230.94s)]
*  because this has been on my mind recently. [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=2234.86s)]
*  I've been realizing that I have, you know, [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=2236.58s)]
*  in, you know, working and I work in, you know, [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=2240.42s)]
*  I'm in, I don't work in, I'm in, you know, [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=2243.78s)]
*  12 step programming. [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=2246.26s)]
*  I always have to call my, you know, sponsor my friends [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=2248.1s)]
*  and just ask them, is everything okay? [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=2250.86s)]
*  Because I don't know, there's something inside of me [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=2254.78s)]
*  that everything's not gonna be okay all the time. [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=2256.82s)]
*  And that's why I'm always having to do stuff [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=2261.06s)]
*  because everything, nothing feels stable. [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=2262.86s)]
*  And so my mind's always like, oh, you better, [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=2266.82s)]
*  you gotta do this, you gotta do this, you gotta do this [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=2268.62s)]
*  because something's not, you know. [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=2270.34s)]
*  So I would just, you know, what's helped me recently is, [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=2274.7400000000002s)]
*  for me, I don't know if this could be work for you, [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=2278.7000000000003s)]
*  but for me, what has helped is just asking somebody [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=2280.58s)]
*  on a regular basis, hey, is everything's okay, right? [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=2284.2200000000003s)]
*  And they just say, yeah, man, everything's okay. [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=2289.78s)]
*  I say, okay, so I have this feeling [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=2293.34s)]
*  like everything's not okay. [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=2294.6600000000003s)]
*  And it's just been there my whole life [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=2297.5s)]
*  and sometimes I don't even realize it. [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=2299.1800000000003s)]
*  I don't even know that this thing was there. [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=2301.82s)]
*  You know, but I'm here to tell you, man, [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=2305.38s)]
*  I think a lot of that comes from just the, [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=2307.86s)]
*  like you're saying, the instability, just the uncertainty [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=2309.78s)]
*  that things, something's gonna go wrong. [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=2312.38s)]
*  For me, it's not that as much as something [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=2314.5s)]
*  is gonna go wrong. [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=2316.46s)]
*  As much as it is that something has to be done. [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=2318.7799999999997s)]
*  That something is wrong, something isn't done. [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=2325.74s)]
*  Something's not okay. [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=2329.18s)]
*  And it's really an intense anxiety. [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=2332.38s)]
*  It's one that's built down into us. [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=2336.46s)]
*  It's like somebody had a treasure chest [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=2339.2999999999997s)]
*  but no treasure in it, just anxiety, [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=2340.9s)]
*  and they put that batch deep in us. [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=2343.2599999999998s)]
*  And one thing that has helped me is, [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=2346.5s)]
*  is talking to my sponsor, talking to my friends [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=2349.42s)]
*  and saying, hey, just tell me that everything's okay. [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=2351.34s)]
*  Is everything okay? [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=2355.22s)]
*  And they'll answer yes. [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=2356.3s)]
*  Sometimes they even get frustrated with it. [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=2357.14s)]
*  But I need to hear it. [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=2359.98s)]
*  I just need to hear it on a regular basis [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=2361.74s)]
*  that everything is okay. [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=2363.38s)]
*  Because I think as a child, just no one told me it was. [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=2365.18s)]
*  You know, when everything felt wrong [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=2369.26s)]
*  and everything felt messed up and, [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=2370.78s)]
*  you know, no one ever said, hey, everything's okay. [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=2372.98s)]
*  No one ever said it. [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=2377.18s)]
*  And if you have children, look, I don't have children. [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=2382.02s)]
*  You know, I don't know what that's like, [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=2384.7s)]
*  but I do know what it's like to have been one. [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=2386.1s)]
*  And I think, you know, it just, [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=2390.7799999999997s)]
*  I think it helps them to hear that sometimes. [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=2393.8999999999996s)]
*  Just for no reason at all. [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=2395.7799999999997s)]
*  Just, you know, just hope that they're okay. [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=2397.22s)]
*  And at all, just hug your kid and just say, [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=2400.7s)]
*  hey, you know, everything is okay, you know. [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=2403.98s)]
*  You know, you might not think it is, [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=2409.7799999999997s)]
*  or sometimes you may feel like things aren't, [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=2411.3399999999997s)]
*  but I'm just here to remind you that everything is, you know. [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=2412.8999999999996s)]
*  I think if they have that voice bouncing around in them, [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=2415.58s)]
*  that's the sugar, baby. [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=2419.74s)]
*  That's not the dander, if you feel me. [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=2420.58s)]
*  But thanks for that call, man, [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=2424.62s)]

*  to grow up in a place like that. [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=2490.46s)]

*  they would take everybody into the cafeteria [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=2711.58s)]
*  and take their shirts off. [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=2713.7400000000002s)]

*  Miss Wascombe or Miss Conaton or Miss whoever. [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=2739.14s)]
*  Miss Barbaras, she would stand right there. [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=2742.22s)]
*  And she would take a marker, man. [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=2745.02s)]
*  She would take a marker and just draw it [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=2746.8599999999997s)]
*  straight down your back. [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=2748.62s)]

*  And then they had like one group, [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=2757.14s)]
*  I guess, if you had scoliosis, [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=2758.94s)]

*  You know, I'm ready for a life change. [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=2774.58s)]

*  You know, your spine got a little wandery in the middle. [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=2782.5s)]
*  That shit got a little Hansel, Hansel Gretel. [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=2785.94s)]
*  You know, your spine kinda went missing on itself a little. [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=2788.94s)]
*  You know, your spine kinda wandered off [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=2792.46s)]
*  into the woods over there by one of your, you know, [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=2793.94s)]
*  your spine kinda did a little detour [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=2797.42s)]
*  around one of your lungs or something, damn. [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=2799.18s)]
*  And so they do everybody. [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=2802.62s)]
*  And anybody had that little, you know, [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=2803.8199999999997s)]
*  had that HOV lane on their backbone [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=2806.66s)]
*  and couldn't, you know, hit that dolphin, [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=2809.3799999999997s)]
*  they'd draw the little crook on their back with the marker [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=2811.2999999999997s)]
*  and put him in that special area. [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=2814.02s)]
*  I don't know what happened to those kids, man. [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=2816.8999999999996s)]
*  And Daniel, dude, everybody knows Daniel, bro. [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=2820.1s)]
*  I remember one time he took his shirt off [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=2822.74s)]
*  and they had his spine in him. [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=2824.66s)]
*  It had the damn, it went in a damn pentagram. [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=2826.5s)]
*  But like, well, he couldn't be real healthy. [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=2833.3s)]
*  So, but you know Daniel, man, he's, I'm not shocked. [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=2840.26s)]
*  He probably shifted his spine into that shape by himself [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=2845.94s)]
*  because he makes his own choices. [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=2849.94s)]

*  And yeah, I'm just super curious [[00:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=3357.1800000000003s)]
*  about what that life is like. [[00:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=3359.9s)]
*  You know, just to be on that constant hide and seek. [[00:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=3362.46s)]
*  Or if it's like that at all. [[00:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=3365.7400000000002s)]
*  So gang brother. [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=3368.2200000000003s)]
*  Here we go, Onward. [[00:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=3370.54s)]
*  What up, DL? [[00:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=3373.5s)]
*  Long time listener, first time caller. [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=3374.82s)]
*  Always wanted to say that. [[00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=3376.86s)]
*  Big fan of your show, man. [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=3378.86s)]
*  And you seem to revolve around solutions. [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=3380.02s)]
*  That's kind of what I'm calling about, man. [[00:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=3382.5800000000004s)]
*  I could use a solution. [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=3384.02s)]
*  Probably a little off topic and a little random, [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=3385.38s)]
*  but I'm a zookeeper, man. [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=3387.38s)]
*  I work with animals. [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=3388.7000000000003s)]
*  I've been doing this for about 10 years. [[00:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=3389.6200000000003s)]

*  Onward. [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=3410.98s)]
*  And I'm having a hard time finding a place I can stay. [[00:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=3412.7400000000002s)]
*  Make a long story short, standards. [[00:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=3416.38s)]
*  I think people got low standards, man. [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=3419.02s)]
*  I've worked for roadside zoos. [[00:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=3420.7s)]
*  I've worked for big zoos. [[00:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=3422.7799999999997s)]
*  I've kind of done it all in between. [[00:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=3424.06s)]
*  Aquariums, trains for movies. [[00:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=3425.54s)]
*  Oh yeah, aquarium, that wet zoo, bro, gang. [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=3428.14s)]
*  Rehab, rescue. [[00:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=3432.06s)]
*  But I have a hard time finding a place with good standards. [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=3434.4199999999996s)]
*  Oh yeah, animal rehab. [[00:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=3436.8999999999996s)]
*  I can't even imagine that. [[00:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=3439.14s)]
*  You got a couple gophers in there on the lauded or something. [[00:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=3440.9399999999996s)]
*  You know, you got maybe you might have a musk rat in there [[00:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=3444.46s)]
*  who's been scratching too much musk, you feel me? [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=3446.8999999999996s)]
*  And the thing you do is on them 80 milligram oxies, bro. [[00:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=3449.66s)]
*  The emojis, gang, onward. [[00:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=3451.7s)]
*  Just think it's a choice to take care of animals [[00:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=3454.42s)]
*  and we gotta make a choice to be right by them. [[00:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=3456.94s)]
*  And too often I think mistakes happen [[00:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=3458.8599999999997s)]
*  and I just think some things need a little more structure, [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=3461.66s)]
*  a little more rules. [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=3464.5s)]
*  We need a little more, everybody just needs to tighten up. [[00:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=3465.38s)]
*  You know, these animals are at our mercy. [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=3468.42s)]
*  And so I don't know, man. [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=3470.2599999999998s)]
*  I'm just, I'm thinking about hanging it up. [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=3472.2999999999997s)]
*  I'm thinking about, the only thing I've ever done [[00:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=3473.8199999999997s)]
*  is construction. [[00:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=3476.66s)]
*  I'm thinking about going back to construction work. [[00:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=3477.5s)]
*  I just don't know what else to do, [[00:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=3479.54s)]
*  but I love my animals and I love working with them. [[00:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=3480.66s)]
*  And it's been a long time to get to where I am [[00:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=3482.66s)]
*  and I'd hate to give it up, [[00:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=3485.3s)]
*  but I just, I feel like I'm losing myself. [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=3487.26s)]
*  I feel like I'm settling with my own morals [[00:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=3490.18s)]
*  and my own convictions just to fit in and get along. [[00:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=3492.7s)]
*  And I don't like that, doesn't feel good. [[00:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=3495.62s)]
*  So again, I appreciate what you're doing, brother gang, gang. [[00:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=3497.1s)]
*  Gang, man, wow. [[00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=3500.46s)]
*  Wow, man. [[00:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=3505.06s)]
*  Dude, I would love for you to get the proper, [[00:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=3507.82s)]
*  you know, me and Brendan Child, [[00:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=3511.86s)]
*  he's from King and the Sting, you know him. [[00:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=3514.9s)]
*  And he's a decent man. [[00:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=3517.14s)]
*  He has very, his hair is very nice. [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=3518.5s)]
*  He has nice hair and he has jewelry and everything. [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=3520.86s)]
*  But he and I almost invested in a zoo down there [[00:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=3525.38s)]
*  in Sinaloa, Sinaloa. [[00:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=3529.18s)]
*  But anyway, some shit went wrong, [[00:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=3531.54s)]
*  but I would love to see you have your own zoo [[00:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=3534.78s)]
*  and have you see you be the example. [[00:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=3540.7400000000002s)]
*  You be the one that does it. [[00:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=3545.2200000000003s)]
*  Because that's really where, you know, [[00:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=3548.82s)]
*  change kind of comes from is that. [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=3550.2200000000003s)]
*  It's like, yeah, nowadays everybody wants, [[00:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=3551.78s)]
*  you know, they had a special on television, [[00:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=3555.2200000000003s)]
*  black sheep, not black sheep, but black dolphin. [[00:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=3557.5400000000004s)]
*  And they had a killer whale down there in, [[00:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=3562.98s)]
*  down near San Diego. [[00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=3568.86s)]
*  And I guess they had a black dolphin as well. [[00:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=3571.46s)]
*  And I guess it was, I don't know if it was about slavery. [[00:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=3573.22s)]
*  I don't know what it was about, dude. [[00:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=3576.06s)]
*  You gotta watch it. [[00:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=3577.1s)]
*  But everybody's like, oh, they're treating animals bad [[00:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=3577.94s)]
*  and they're treating animals like this. [[00:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=3580.86s)]
*  Look, it's hard to treat an animal great, I think, [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=3583.34s)]
*  especially with all the laws and everything. [[00:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=3589.58s)]
*  You know, everything keeps getting haywire. [[00:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=3593.06s)]
*  Some lady, you know, some lady's little son [[00:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=3594.7799999999997s)]
*  falls in the damn zoo cage and then they file the lawsuit. [[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=3596.86s)]
*  Well, what's your son doing in there? [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=3600.66s)]
*  How about that? [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=3603.98s)]
*  So the lawyering and all the legalities [[01:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=3606.34s)]
*  ruin a lot of things, brother. [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=3608.54s)]
*  But that's when somebody comes along and says, [[01:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=3611.2999999999997s)]
*  I'm gonna do this the right way. [[01:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=3612.94s)]
*  And that could be you. [[01:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=3617.58s)]
*  You know, you could have Terrence's little magical zoo [[01:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=3619.2999999999997s)]
*  at the, you know, it could be zoo and ice cream or something. [[01:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=3621.62s)]
*  You know, pet you a koala and get a rocky road. [[01:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=3626.22s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[01:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=3630.02s)]
*  Tickle a real Elmo and then get you [[01:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=3630.86s)]
*  that mint chocolate chimpanzee. [[01:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=3633.18s)]
*  You could have, you know, you could mix and match. [[01:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=3635.82s)]
*  So I think there's an opportunity there [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=3639.62s)]
*  for you to then do something special whenever the, [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=3642.14s)]
*  you know, it's tough though sometimes also when your art [[01:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=3647.5s)]
*  or something you really enjoy when it becomes a job, [[01:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=3649.98s)]
*  at a certain point it does burn you out. [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=3654.06s)]
*  It burns you out, man. [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=3658.7s)]
*  There's such a balance to everything, isn't there? [[01:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=3661.14s)]
*  Man, when the art becomes such a job, [[01:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=3666.02s)]
*  it can burn you down. [[01:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=3668.78s)]
*  You know, I feel exhausted sometimes from, [[01:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=3672.9s)]
*  you know, work got so busy that sometimes I feel exhausted. [[01:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=3675.46s)]
*  You know, sometimes I feel, well, I need my passion back. [[01:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=3680.98s)]
*  You get caught up too much in the Xs and the Os [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=3686.02s)]
*  and you forget the smell of the grass, you know. [[01:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=3689.58s)]
*  And that's how I think, you know, you have to, [[01:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=3699.06s)]
*  you have to find a way to represent it to yourself [[01:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=3700.7400000000002s)]
*  or get you a little animal, get you a lemur, bro, [[01:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=3702.7s)]

*  I don't need to do all that. [[01:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=4108.52s)]
*  But if you got an incel like that living in your place, bro, [[01:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=4110.4400000000005s)]

*  looks like it's winking at her or something, [[01:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=4117.4400000000005s)]
*  or somebody carved a Jesus Christ [[01:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=4119.88s)]

*  It's all I got for you, dude. [[01:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=4129.740000000001s)]
*  I gotta be honest with you, gang. [[01:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=4130.8s)]
*  What's up, Theo? [[01:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=4134.64s)]
*  This is Max Frost calling in from Sydney, Australia. [[01:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=4136.52s)]
*  Oh, Max Frost from Australia, thank you for calling, man. [[01:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=4140.56s)]
*  And after all that fire, you guys could use Max Frost. [[01:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=4144.200000000001s)]
*  I mean, you're exactly the solution over there, I bet, man. [[01:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=4149.04s)]
*  Hope everybody's doing well. [[01:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=4151.6s)]
*  It's crazy, like, you know, [[01:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=4152.68s)]
*  we see a million pictures of koalas, you know, [[01:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=4154.64s)]
*  starving and using water and stuff, [[01:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=4157.4400000000005s)]
*  and then suddenly, it's off the radar. [[01:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=4160.360000000001s)]
*  But just letting you know, man, thinking of you, [[01:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=4163.56s)]
*  hope you guys are doing well, gang, onward. [[01:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=4167.280000000001s)]

*  I'm actually from Texas. [[01:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=4174.84s)]
*  I'm down here right now doing some shows. [[01:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=4175.8s)]

*  That's called a visitor, buddy, onward. [[01:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=4180.200000000001s)]
*  One of the reasons I'm calling, man, [[01:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=4183.76s)]
*  is I'm down here and living my life, you know, [[01:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=4185.280000000001s)]
*  I make music and down here playing shows [[01:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=4189.56s)]
*  and had a show tonight that I guess was good, [[01:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=4192.18s)]
*  but I guess I just kind of called in to say, like, [[01:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=4194.9400000000005s)]
*  I don't know, there's something about that voice [[01:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=4198.02s)]
*  you talk about where you say, like, [[01:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=4199.4800000000005s)]
*  whenever you get off stage, [[01:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=4200.740000000001s)]
*  it feels like your brain won't allow you to [[01:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=4203.14s)]
*  accept that you did a good job. [[01:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=4206.820000000001s)]
*  There's just something about that I really relate to, man, [[01:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=4209.820000000001s)]
*  and that I fucking, I wish I could solve, you know? [[01:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=4211.58s)]
*  I hate showing up to do what I came to do [[01:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=4215.820000000001s)]
*  and then getting off stage and feeling like, [[01:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=4220.02s)]
*  like, even though I did it, it's like I can't allow myself [[01:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=4224.1s)]
*  to appreciate that it's happening, which is stupid. [[01:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=4228.820000000001s)]
*  Shit, man. [[01:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=4236.660000000001s)]
*  That's it, hope you're good, bro. [[01:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=4238.34s)]
*  Gang, gang. [[01:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=4239.42s)]
*  Gang, bro, thank you for calling, man. [[01:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=4240.660000000001s)]
*  Yeah, man. [[01:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=4244.540000000001s)]
*  Wow, bro. [[01:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=4247.06s)]
*  Okay. [[01:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=4249.46s)]
*  Yeah, you know one of the reasons, [[01:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=4253.06s)]
*  I mean, I've done it my whole life, man, nothing. [[01:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=4255.02s)]
*  You know, I'll never be good enough for me, man. [[01:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=4260.02s)]
*  And I don't know how that happened to me. [[01:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=4267.02s)]
*  I don't know how that, [[01:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=4268.6s)]
*  you know, I don't know how that got inside of me. [[01:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=4275.7s)]
*  But man, that's a devilish thing to end up inside of you. [[01:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=4279.46s)]
*  And I'm not saying that to have any self-pity. [[01:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=4282.78s)]
*  You know, I'm at the age now, I'm able to recognize it [[01:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=4286.02s)]
*  and I can do things to help myself, but, [[01:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=4288.58s)]
*  but, you know, it gets hard on the podcast sometimes [[01:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=4294.94s)]
*  because it's hard for me to reflect on myself [[01:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=4301.66s)]
*  without sounding like a crybaby a lot, you know? [[01:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=4303.34s)]
*  I don't wanna have self-pity. [[01:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=4306.54s)]
*  But I do wanna be able to share what I, [[01:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=4309.26s)]
*  share things, share something if I can, you know? [[01:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=4313.22s)]
*  But no, man, it's crazy that, [[01:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=4317.9800000000005s)]
*  isn't that crazy that somehow [[01:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=4321.58s)]
*  we will never be enough for ourselves? [[01:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=4322.860000000001s)]
*  Man, it's such a, it's such a handicap, isn't it? [[01:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=4327.88s)]
*  It's such a, and it's not true, it's not even real. [[01:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=4331.54s)]
*  I don't know how that engine gets started inside of us. [[01:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=4336.34s)]
*  I'm trying to think about it and feel about it right now. [[01:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=4344.46s)]
*  Why am I never enough for myself? [[01:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=4346.68s)]
*  You know, I will never be enough for myself. [[01:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=4360.34s)]
*  Why? [[01:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=4363.58s)]
*  Why, why, why am I never enough for myself, man? [[01:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=4367.42s)]
*  I'm just trying to feel, I'm trying to, [[01:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=4379.34s)]
*  sometimes I can almost feel an answer like inside of me, [[01:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=4381.74s)]
*  but I don't know what the words are [[01:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=4384.099999999999s)]
*  because the feeling hasn't met with my brain exactly. [[01:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=4385.46s)]
*  So I'm just trying to feel this out, you know, why? [[01:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=4391.46s)]
*  Yeah, how nice it would be to have something [[01:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=4399.58s)]
*  inside of myself that's like, hey you, man, great job. [[01:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=4401.38s)]
*  Hey, you did great. [[01:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=4404.42s)]
*  Hey, you should be proud of yourself. [[01:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=4407.06s)]
*  Hey, you should, hey man, way to go. [[01:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=4408.94s)]
*  Because when you think about it from the outside, [[01:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=4411.38s)]
*  from an outsider's perspective, [[01:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=4412.9400000000005s)]
*  how sad that somebody's walking around, [[01:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=4414.1s)]
*  they will never be enough for themselves. [[01:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=4416.26s)]
*  That their best will never make them feel good. [[01:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=4420.1s)]
*  It doesn't sound like that, [[01:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=4422.02s)]
*  it sounds like there's something off there [[01:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=4423.62s)]
*  because it's not real, it doesn't factually check out. [[01:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=4425.74s)]
*  It's not real. [[01:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=4430.1s)]
*  It's not real. [[01:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=4430.9400000000005s)]
*  It's not real. [[01:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=4431.78s)]
*  It's not real. [[01:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=4432.62s)]
*  It's not real. [[01:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=4433.46s)]
*  It's not real. [[01:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=4434.3s)]
*  It's not real. [[01:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=4435.12s)]
*  It's not real. [[01:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=4435.96s)]
*  It's not real. [[01:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=4436.8s)]
*  It's not real. [[01:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=4437.64s)]
*  It's not real. [[01:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=4438.46s)]
*  It's not real. [[01:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=4439.3s)]
*  It doesn't factually check out. [[01:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=4440.22s)]
*  Sometimes I think some of that is the toil [[01:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=4446.54s)]
*  of being an artist. [[01:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=4450.660000000001s)]
*  There's something inside of, [[01:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=4451.860000000001s)]
*  there's people that want to do art. [[01:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=4452.700000000001s)]
*  I think you want some of that because it drives you. [[01:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=4456.34s)]
*  It makes you adjust and change. [[01:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=4458.84s)]
*  It makes you keep pressuring to create something good. [[01:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=4465.5s)]
*  You know, you don't want to just play some garbage and be like, oh, that's great [[01:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=4470.14s)]
*  But I think sometimes for myself at that voice is it's in it's everywhere in me that [[01:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=4475.88s)]
*  I'm never gonna be enough [[01:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=4480.820000000001s)]
*  You know, I got the legs of a seat ever seen a senior citizen drop their towel on accident and you see their legs [[01:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=4482.9800000000005s)]
*  That's what I have though. I [[01:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=4489.320000000001s)]
*  have like those type of legs, but if that man was like a striker and like a [[01:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=4491.5s)]
*  like had like was [[01:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=4496.780000000001s)]
*  But strong I have like strong dropped towel senior citizen legs [[01:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=4499.78s)]
*  But it's always everything I see by myself it's never enough it's never good enough [[01:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=4508.38s)]
*  And I don't know if it no I don't think anyone ever told me that I was bad [[01:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=4516.7s)]
*  I think just nobody ever told me that I was okay that everything was that it was enough, you know, oh [[01:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=4519.66s)]
*  Yeah. Oh [[01:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=4525.0599999999995s)]
*  Yeah, man, you're [[01:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=4526.42s)]
*  Yeah, that's good. You know, okay, that's you've been [[01:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=4528.06s)]
*  You know, and those are things that happen when we're young it has to happen when we're young but when we get old [[01:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=4532.580000000001s)]
*  You know, we can start to plant some different seeds man to bring this back here [[01:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=4537.42s)]
*  You know we can start to do we can start to recognize it [[01:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=4542.3s)]
*  You know, and I'm glad you called about this because I think it'll just make me think when I get off stage or when [[01:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=4546.540000000001s)]
*  I get done with this when I get done with my workday [[01:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=4550.9400000000005s)]
*  anybody out there if you driving FedEx are you making a [[01:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=4553.9400000000005s)]

*  construction [[01:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=4567.06s)]
*  It's yes, like when you get done this is like, you know, I did good to remind ourselves we you know that we did good [[01:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=4570.22s)]
*  If we did if we did try we did try our best, you know [[01:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=4578.06s)]
*  Yeah, I don't know man, it's really interesting now it's really interesting why [[01:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=4581.3s)]
*  Somehow we're never enough for ourselves man [[01:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=4586.1s)]
*  And I think that's like the core of whatever it is if we could solve that in humans [[01:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=4590.54s)]
*  And some of that's always gonna be there because there's this you know, that's why people look for a higher power [[01:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=4597.18s)]
*  That's why people seek. That's why people travel. That's why people travel [[01:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=4602.1s)]
*  You know, that's why people look for a higher power that's why people seek that's why people travel that's why people [[01:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=4605.94s)]
*  You know start families because they want to look they want to [[01:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=4612.179999999999s)]
*  fill in [[01:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=4617.54s)]

*  It's just it's a journey of finding [[01:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=4625.46s)]
*  more [[01:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=4628.98s)]
*  At least I hope it is for people maybe some people are just perfectly happy and they're already [[01:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=4631.98s)]
*  you know, they were born on the pinnacle of peace, but I [[01:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=4637.74s)]
*  Think for a lot of us it's trying to find out what's going on. How do we? [[01:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=4641.379999999999s)]
*  What do I do? What can I do? [[01:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=4646.299999999999s)]
*  To feel more to find more to achieve to try to [[01:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=4649.86s)]
*  What is here in this world on the outside and on the inside [[01:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=4656.18s)]
*  You know [[01:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=4661.74s)]
*  Where's the Mount Everest you know out here outside of me? Where's the Mount Everest inside of me? Where's the? [[01:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=4663.74s)]
*  Where can I go in here? [[01:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=4668.94s)]
*  Because man it gets wild inside of us is deep in there and it's high and it's far [[01:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=4671.94s)]
*  So I think some of that's just the toil of being an artist man, and I think some of it is [[01:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=4677.74s)]
*  It's a journey that we're on [[01:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=4681.34s)]
*  You know what some of it is that we're too hard on ourselves and [[01:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=4684.7s)]
*  That we're doing okay [[01:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=4688.9400000000005s)]
*  You know the best thing I sometimes I can say for myself is always just that I tried my best [[01:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=4690.9400000000005s)]
*  But yeah, that's good man, I want to think about that more for myself and not think about it [[01:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=4698.860000000001s)]
*  I just want to start to behave like it. Hey, man. You did a good job [[01:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=4702.62s)]
*  I don't want to do it because I don't want people to think that I'm full of myself [[01:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=4705.86s)]
*  It's I think sometimes it comes back to I'm worried so much about what other people will think maybe I [[01:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=4708.9s)]
*  Don't people to think that I'm so full of myself [[01:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=4714.219999999999s)]

*  That's crazy good about to some people that have two children that people that they can't find yet. It's in, Idaho [[01:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=4785.58s)]
*  That shit is good, and I don't want more people to die in the world, but we need some more date lines boy [[01:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=4792.0199999999995s)]
*  Speaking I'd oh here's one our California kids that bad does Idaho need to build a wall and that's from Kim chickens [[01:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=4803.34s)]
*  from patreon [[01:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=4810.74s)]
*  You know, I don't think California kids are bad man, there's bad people everywhere [[01:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=4813.74s)]
*  You know, there's a lot of great people in California. There's a lot of wonderful people [[01:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=4817.78s)]
*  I think the taxes are way too high. I think that they are too. I think that it's too idealistic. I [[01:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=4821.099999999999s)]
*  think the ideas of a perfect humanity are [[01:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=4829.0199999999995s)]
*  Starting to collide with the realities that [[01:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=4834.139999999999s)]
*  We can't do all of this we don't [[01:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=4838.0199999999995s)]
*  Or we just aren't you know, it's like I mean the parks are getting busier [[01:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=4840.719999999999s)]
*  I was just looking at a park yesterday [[01:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=4845.32s)]
*  I was going to look for a park to just chill out and and I went to a park and I'm like man [[01:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=4847.2s)]
*  This isn't even place you can relax anymore [[01:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=4851.84s)]
*  You know this this is this you know, there's a lot of people who are you know? [[01:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=4854.16s)]
*  you know, I don't want to just say homeless but not well and people that are doing drugs and [[01:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=4858.4s)]
*  And I know some of those people are my people I get it, bro. You know, they're rats like me, you know [[01:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=4863.36s)]
*  But it made me scared to just want to take a nap in the park because I don't want to get killed during a sleeping [[01:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=4869.54s)]
*  so [[01:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=4877.54s)]
*  So I think you have some of that shit I think you got more of a soft batch [[01:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=4880.66s)]
*  overall [[01:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=4886.459999999999s)]
*  You know and I put that up you go SEC against the pack 10 do pack 12 pack 20 pack it up as much as you want [[01:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=4888.0599999999995s)]
*  They'll never take the SEC man [[01:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=4894.58s)]
*  But I just think some of its city living is different so I think maybe Los Angeles is [[01:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=4897.58s)]
*  It's just a tough place it seems like to raise kids to have [[01:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=4905.58s)]
*  You know every every street is a busy street. There's no space for a child's imagination. I don't feel like [[01:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=4909.18s)]
*  You know a child needs to be able to look out at some space and be like oh what could happen here? [[01:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=4916.54s)]
*  So it's probably a great place like raising accountant [[01:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=4921.78s)]
*  But is it a great place to raise somebody with a wild imagination? I don't know I [[01:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=4925.46s)]
*  Don't think it would be my ideal place [[01:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=4932.259999999999s)]
*  gang [[01:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=4934.98s)]
*  Let's take I think we did good today I [[01:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=4938.58s)]
*  Think we did good. Well, here's one right here. Actually one more patreon [[01:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=4944.66s)]
*  From cigar ja JHA [[01:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=4948.58s)]
*  Theo what's the best part about spring gang gang? [[01:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=4951.66s)]
*  I [[01:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=4959.3s)]
*  Think the best part about spring is it's just kind of a reminder of what every day is you know every day is a new chance [[01:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=4959.78s)]
*  Is that you know every day is a silver medal you know every day is saying hey? [[01:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=4965.66s)]
*  If you didn't if it didn't happen yesterday if you didn't do it right if you didn't [[01:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=4971.66s)]
*  Do it as well as you wanted to [[01:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=4975.66s)]
*  It's really a real soft way of saying here's another opportunity [[01:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=4978.58s)]
*  You know here's another shot today [[01:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=4983.74s)]
*  And it really the way that the world even presents a day to you is really so beautiful you know [[01:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=4985.22s)]
*  slow sunrise the light slowly gathers [[01:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=4990.98s)]
*  Wouldn't it be crazy if just BAM they cut it on his fluorescent as fuck [[01:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=4995.42s)]
*  Just felt like an ICU or something just [[01:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=5000.3s)]
*  Just felt like an ICU or something just that would be so drastic [[01:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=5003.18s)]
*  But the way that nature says hey [[01:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=5008.74s)]
*  I'm here you're here. Let's see what we could do [[01:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=5012.86s)]
*  The way that nature does that with it just a day. I think is beautiful in spring. I think is like that [[01:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=5018.38s)]
*  And I do think there's some value to live in a place that we have four seasons because you [[01:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=5025.7s)]
*  Remember that you're part of earth you're part of this [[01:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=5029.78s)]
*  You're part of life [[01:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=5032.78s)]
*  Whereas sometimes in California. It's just the same day forever [[01:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=5035.099999999999s)]
*  It just never ends man [[01:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=5039.42s)]
*  So I think the best part about spring is just as a chance to put something new in the ground you know [[01:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=5044.94s)]
*  To try something different [[01:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=5050.66s)]
*  You know it's crazy all the things sometimes that I feel like I've recently have been feeling is that [[01:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=5054.78s)]
*  The things that I [[01:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=5061.02s)]
*  It's crazy somehow the things that I fear the most [[01:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=5065.18s)]
*  Or sometimes recently the things that are starting to tempt me the most like what if I just did those things [[01:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=5069.26s)]
*  You know what if I just got me a house or got me a wife or got me a [[01:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=5075.9400000000005s)]
*  Or not got me one you got to really have love and everything, but you know got me a dog [[01:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=5080.900000000001s)]
*  What if I did all those things? [[01:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=5086.540000000001s)]
*  I don't know. I don't want to let my life. Just pass by me. Just being in this fear state or this place of indecision [[01:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=5090.06s)]
*  Sometimes I feel like the best feelings I could have are right on the other side of my fears you know [[01:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=5097.780000000001s)]
*  And that's why man, that's why what do I know dude? I don't know anything and that [[01:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=5107.06s)]
*  That is the fact I'm gonna probably call better help [[01:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=5114.38s)]
*  Look I love you guys, and I appreciate you and and thank you for being a part of this past weekend [[01:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=5118.14s)]

*  and [[01:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=5132.18s)]
*  Just I'm just excited to remind myself to get back to what I think is important sometimes [[01:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=5133.700000000001s)]
*  And what is unique sometimes this podcast about this podcast is that it's a group effort, and then we're doing something [[01:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=5138.22s)]
*  Not alone and [[01:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=5145.06s)]
*  that to me feels good man, and that's [[01:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=5147.06s)]
*  That's the sugar, bro [[01:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=5151.9400000000005s)]
*  That's the sugar man [[01:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=5155.1s)]
*  We'll finish out here with this hit again from tiny sand who sent it in [[01:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dWXIIXFFU&t=5157.5s)]
