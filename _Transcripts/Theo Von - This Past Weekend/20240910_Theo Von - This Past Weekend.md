*  I remember I almost made love to a Korean woman [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=1000.9200000000001s)]
*  one time years ago, and this was in Idaho, [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=1002.8000000000001s)]
*  and her legs kind of didn't separate. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=1004.48s)]
*  It was almost like, [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=1007.24s)]
*  really strong chopsticks or whatever, [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=1008.12s)]

*  Wait, wait, wait. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=1010.64s)]
*  It was just like that, I swear to God. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=1011.8000000000001s)]
*  Maybe it was a mermaid. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=1013.5200000000001s)]
*  Huh? [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=1015.5200000000001s)]
*  Right? [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=1017.32s)]
*  Was it a mermaid? [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=1019.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=1019.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=1020.6800000000001s)]
*  Are there Korean Asian mermaids? [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=1021.5200000000001s)]
*  There have to be, huh? [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=1023.9200000000001s)]
*  Bring that up. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=1024.76s)]
*  Bring up an Asian mermaid or something, [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=1025.64s)]
*  beached Asians or whatever. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=1027.96s)]
*  Because if there were, they'd probably eat their own [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=1030.52s)]
*  because they love sushi. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=1032.32s)]
*  Oh. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=1033.88s)]

*  I was in Hawaii that day, [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=1044.0800000000002s)]
*  and I saw that at a store, [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=1046.0800000000002s)]
*  and I bought it immediately, and I ran to the beach. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=1048.16s)]
*  I go, take this photo. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=1050.3600000000001s)]

*  oh, with me in it, no? [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=1060.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=1062.72s)]
*  It wouldn't be Little Mermaid, it'd be Fat Mermaid. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=1063.5600000000002s)]
*  But they'd have like, [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=1065.24s)]

*  a play they play all day in the zoo. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=1070.44s)]
*  The music would change. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=1075.44s)]
*  Wandering tree. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=1076.44s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=1078.48s)]

*  Yeah, he's a good dude. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=1103.8s)]
*  You don't tour as much, people wanna see you in more places, [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=1105.8s)]
*  but you don't like leaving home as much, is that true? [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=1107.8s)]
*  Yeah, that's, I don't go out at all. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=1110.08s)]
*  In fact, I'm going up to Vancouver the 12th, [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=1113.0s)]
*  and I'm doing it with Sigurra, and Sigurra's like, [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=1118.0s)]
*  well, can you do the day before and then the day after, too, [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=1119.72s)]
*  because I'm playing Eugene in some place in Colorado, [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=1123.3999999999999s)]
*  and I just do Vancouver, you know what I mean? [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=1127.2s)]
*  Because I just, you don't like being away from home? [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=1130.3999999999999s)]
*  Well, I mean, just truth of the matter is, [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=1136.8s)]
*  is that I like doing stand-up and spurts. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=1139.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=1144.84s)]
*  And I'm not addicted to, like, I see Santino [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=1145.68s)]
*  and all these guys, they're all addicted to the, you know, [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=1149.24s)]
*  dopamine hits, not dopium, wait, dopamine, dopamine. [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=1153.76s)]
*  Dopamine hits, yeah. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=1157.92s)]
*  Dopamine hits, right, doing shows, and it's like, [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=1158.76s)]
*  I've just never been addicted to that dopamine hit. [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=1161.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=1165.04s)]
*  You know, I love being at home. [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=1165.8799999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=1169.16s)]
*  Yeah, and I don't know how you do it, [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=1170.0s)]
*  because every time I'm on line, I see you, [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=1172.16s)]
*  you're in Australia or wherever, whatever, [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=1175.0s)]
*  and you're killing it, and it's like, I'm happy for you, [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=1177.16s)]
*  but I just never had that addiction to it, you know? [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=1179.3999999999999s)]
*  I think because of the fact that, like, early on, [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=1184.1200000000001s)]
*  I had just so much trauma from it. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=1186.64s)]
*  From being on stage? [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=1189.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=1190.04s)]
*  Like, one time I was at, it's a casino gig in New Jersey, [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=1191.04s)]
*  I forgot what it was called, [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=1195.52s)]
*  and it's a casino gig that everyone played. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=1197.3600000000001s)]
*  Montenegro? [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=1200.04s)]
*  I don't know what it was, but it was like, [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=1201.3600000000001s)]
*  and I remember they had this red curtain behind the stage, [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=1204.04s)]
*  and I remember one show, I bombed so hard, [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=1209.32s)]
*  because this is before, I think now, you know, [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=1212.0s)]
*  because I have fans that get me, you know what I mean? [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=1214.56s)]
*  But before, when I was just on MADtv and stuff, [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=1218.52s)]
*  like, my fans, I mean, they knew me from sketch, [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=1221.48s)]
*  and so they wanted to see me do, you know what I mean, [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=1225.24s)]
*  my catchphrases, like, you know, [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=1228.4s)]
*  sometimes I do, or, uh-oh, hot dog, or whatever, right? [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=1230.8s)]
*  Like, home alone or whatever? [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=1235.4s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=1237.84s)]
*  You know what I'm talking about? [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=1239.56s)]
*  Why don't they have an Asian home alone? [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=1240.6s)]
*  Why don't y'all make a home alone? [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=1242.04s)]
*  Right, well, the home is made out of rice paper, aren't they? [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=1243.48s)]
*  Yeah, sure. Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=1248.04s)]
*  And it's like, yeah, and they could get in quickly. [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=1249.44s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. The burglars, right? [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=1251.84s)]
*  They could just run through, like, the Hulk, right? [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=1253.52s)]
*  So maybe that's why. [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=1255.6399999999999s)]
*  I think it'd be a 10-minute movie then. [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=1256.8s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. You know what I mean? [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=1258.28s)]
*  Get me! Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=1259.12s)]
*  I'm home alone, I dying! [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=1260.8799999999999s)]
*  Or whatever. [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=1262.8s)]
*  That's very good, clever, dude. [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=1264.12s)]
*  You got, well, I think different cultures [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=1265.36s)]
*  should all have their own films. [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=1266.8s)]
*  Okay, let's talk about it. [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=1268.24s)]
*  So I think that they should be, there should be a castaway, [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=1270.32s)]
*  right, but an Asian guy, right, [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=1273.52s)]
*  and instead of him talking to the volleyball, [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=1276.6799999999998s)]
*  what'd they call him? [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=1281.6799999999998s)]
*  Wilson. Wilson, right? [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=1283.04s)]
*  Instead of that, he makes a volleyball factory, right? [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=1285.32s)]
*  He's a sweatshop, he makes monkeys and stuff work, [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=1290.0s)]
*  you know what I mean? Yeah. [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=1292.12s)]
*  Right, so you do little twists like that. [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=1293.12s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=1295.0s)]
*  I think more about the industry or something. [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=1295.84s)]
*  It's more about work ethic. Yeah, yeah. [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=1297.84s)]
*  You know what I mean? And resilience in that way. [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=1299.36s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=1301.6799999999998s)]

*  Somebody that he has a relationship with. [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=1866.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=1868.04s)]
*  That he's a 10. [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=1869.8400000000001s)]
*  I think he's a 10. [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=1871.44s)]
*  But I don't think that if you're not in his visual range [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=1873.24s)]
*  or in his ecosystem, it's hard to get in. [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=1877.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=1879.8000000000002s)]
*  Because he's so elusive. [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=1880.64s)]
*  Yeah, he's cool. [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=1883.0400000000002s)]
*  He'll park his car, he'll do a set, [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=1883.88s)]
*  and there's no way of like, you know what I mean, [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=1885.3200000000002s)]

*  and developing a relationship. [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=1889.68s)]
*  I think he, the people he knows is who he knows. [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=1891.0400000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=1894.3600000000001s)]
*  And that fucking roster is filled. [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=1895.2s)]
*  Yeah, that's what I think. [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=1897.3200000000002s)]
*  And I think at a certain point, you've done all of that, [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=1898.2s)]
*  and it's like you only have so much bandwidth. [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=1899.72s)]
*  He have children. [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=1901.44s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=1902.48s)]
*  He have a wife and parents. [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=1903.3200000000002s)]
*  And I think it's just, yeah, that's, you know, [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=1904.8000000000002s)]
*  I don't know if doing a lot of that fucking, [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=1910.16s)]
*  yeah, yeah, yeah, glad-handing and shit. [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=1913.0800000000002s)]
*  It's not his shit, really. [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=1916.24s)]
*  Yeah, but you're good at it. [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=1917.3200000000002s)]
*  Well, I feel desperate, probably, [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=1918.68s)]
*  for it to be a people pleaser. [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=1920.44s)]
*  No, because the truth is, last night, [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=1922.0s)]
*  when I was with those two girls that I was with. [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=1923.96s)]
*  Three girls you were with. [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=1925.8000000000002s)]
*  No, the other one was a stray. [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=1928.96s)]
*  Well, whatever, dude. [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=1931.0800000000002s)]

*  and she went to your show. [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=1934.4s)]
*  Well, it's funny that a stray went missing, [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=1935.52s)]
*  or made an Asian up. [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=1937.28s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=1938.1200000000001s)]

*  I don't have that thing like, oh, this could backfire. [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=1948.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=1951.92s)]
*  You know, sometimes people are like that, [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=1952.76s)]
*  where like a girl will go, hey, can I, [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=1954.3200000000002s)]

*  I went to high school with him. [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=1959.1599999999999s)]
*  He was at the store maybe a month ago, [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=1960.96s)]
*  and he's never been to the store, [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=1963.08s)]
*  and he's like so like, he's one of those high school friends [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=1965.6799999999998s)]

*  And I love this guy. [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=1975.28s)]
*  And we were at the store, and he sees Mark Maron, [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=1977.1599999999999s)]
*  and he goes, can you introduce me? [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=1979.8s)]
*  And for a split second, I was like, I don't know. [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=1982.76s)]
*  I did it. [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=1987.28s)]
*  Mark was also eating pizza, which I've never seen him do. [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=1988.48s)]
*  I never seen him eat anything. [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=1991.24s)]
*  I know. [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=1993.48s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=1994.3200000000002s)]
*  Yeah, me either. [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=1995.16s)]
*  So it's, yeah, it's scary to introduce. [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=1996.3600000000001s)]
*  But he was not, he was not, I saw. [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=1998.24s)]
*  He was, yeah. [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=1999.3200000000002s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=2000.16s)]
*  But you don't know. [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=2001.0s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=2002.3600000000001s)]
*  Well, Mark doesn't pretend a lot, I don't think. [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=2003.2s)]
*  So I feel like, you're gonna get the real Mark, [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=2005.8s)]
*  it's like Bill Burr, you're gonna get [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=2008.72s)]
*  who they are at that moment. [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=2010.28s)]
*  Okay, do you get scared around him? [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=2011.92s)]
*  When you walk up to him. [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=2013.16s)]
*  Bill? [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=2014.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=2014.8400000000001s)]
*  Bill Burr, I get, and I feel bad, it's just me. [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=2015.84s)]
*  He came on the show last night, dude. [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=2018.84s)]
*  He jumped on the show. [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=2020.28s)]
*  Yeah, I know. [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=2021.12s)]
*  It was fucking awesome, dude. [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=2021.9399999999998s)]
*  I stood on the side and I was like, [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=2023.8s)]
*  I need to go home and work right now. [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=2025.1599999999999s)]

*  He just, he is, I mean, he is the best, maybe. [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=2029.0s)]
*  I think he's the best, but there's just something about, [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=2034.6799999999998s)]
*  me and Andrew were doing Bad Friends. [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=2037.32s)]
*  He was upstairs, I guess, as an editing place, [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=2039.04s)]
*  and he was editing a special. [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=2042.3999999999999s)]
*  We didn't know that. [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=2043.8799999999999s)]
*  So we're just doing Bad Friends. [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=2045.04s)]
*  He just walks in. [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=2046.36s)]
*  We had no idea. [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=2048.6s)]
*  And it was almost as if I was tongue tied. [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=2050.04s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=2052.92s)]
*  I mean, he's done Tiger Billy a bunch of times. [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=2053.76s)]
*  I've been to his house. [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=2056.6s)]
*  I'm friends with him. [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=2058.2s)]
*  I love the guy, right? [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=2059.04s)]
*  But every once in a while, I get tongue tied. [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=2060.3s)]
*  Like, I don't know what to say. [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=2062.28s)]
*  And I'm always like, he's one of those guys [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=2063.84s)]
*  where it's like, you let him talk. [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=2065.88s)]
*  Yes. [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=2067.48s)]
*  And then you go, yeah, man, that's cool. [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=2068.32s)]
*  Dude, that's how I was last night. [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=2069.84s)]
*  I was all embarrassed. [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=2071.52s)]
*  It was almost like a hot chick was there. [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=2073.32s)]
*  I know, yeah, he's a hot chick. [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=2075.36s)]
*  And you're like, at the certain points, [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=2076.96s)]
*  I couldn't even look at him. [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=2078.48s)]
*  I just look at my other friend, [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=2079.48s)]
*  and we were both supposed to be listening to him. [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=2080.7999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=2082.7999999999997s)]
*  We were both looking at each other. [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=2083.64s)]
*  Yeah, and he's also a super nice guy, [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=2084.48s)]
*  too, which is also rattled. [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=2088.44s)]
*  I kind of wish he was a dick. [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=2089.44s)]
*  Well, I think his material is so like him. [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=2091.4s)]
*  There's something that's intimidating about him, [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=2095.48s)]
*  but I don't think he means it to be that way. [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=2097.56s)]
*  No. [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=2100.48s)]
*  His material is just so. [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=2101.32s)]
*  It's in our heads. [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=2102.6000000000004s)]
*  Oh, totally. [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=2103.88s)]
*  It's so funny you said that. [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=2104.7200000000003s)]
*  Yeah, it's in our heads. [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=2105.56s)]
*  Because he left, and we're all like, [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=2106.56s)]

*  Yeah, I had some ideas, but I think I was super nervous. [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=2413.68s)]
*  I'd had a long week, and it was like, [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=2416.48s)]
*  you ever have a date you're excited for, [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=2419.6s)]
*  but you've had a craziest, longest week, [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=2421.52s)]
*  and then it finally, Friday night comes or something, [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=2423.32s)]
*  you're like, ugh. [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=2424.88s)]
*  Yeah, that's what it was. [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=2425.84s)]
*  Yeah, that's what it was, and so it was like, [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=2427.28s)]
*  you know, and so I just, [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=2430.8s)]
*  and I knew I had a limited amount of time. [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=2432.36s)]
*  What was the time? [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=2434.0800000000004s)]
*  Probably 52 minutes we had. [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=2434.96s)]
*  52 minutes? [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=2437.0400000000004s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=2437.88s)]

*  Yeah, but I know we can go fast, [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=2439.5600000000004s)]
*  and he can get on some, he gets on some tangents, [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=2441.28s)]
*  and he'll go. Tangents, right, he goes in and out, yeah, yeah. [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=2443.5600000000004s)]
*  So I didn't, I was like, [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=2444.6800000000003s)]
*  you have to kind of curtail him a little bit, you know? [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=2445.88s)]
*  And so I tried to do that. [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=2449.36s)]
*  With the clips I've seen, though, [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=2451.4s)]
*  I think that you were pretty, you were good. [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=2452.48s)]

*  Yeah. [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=2477.04s)]
*  I'm not the president of Asians. [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=2478.16s)]
*  I seem to think that, [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=2481.24s)]
*  you seem to think that I'm their leader. [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=2482.4799999999996s)]
*  Like, every month there's a gathering, right? [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=2485.68s)]
*  And I get all this information from people. [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=2488.3999999999996s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=2490.3999999999996s)]

*  I'm their spokesperson or something. [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=2492.08s)]

*  I had, like from 15 minutes ago, and then you were like, [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=2850.16s)]
*  oh, I wanna go back to that, and we never did. [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=2853.2s)]
*  Oh, about what? [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=2855.2s)]
*  I forgot. [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=2856.24s)]
*  Was that sexual or whatever? [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=2857.12s)]
*  No, no, no, no. [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=2857.92s)]
*  No, after that. [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=2858.7599999999998s)]
*  I didn't even explain it to you. [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=2862.88s)]
*  Something happened to me the other day, and I was- [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=2864.48s)]
*  Yeah, what was it? [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=2866.2799999999997s)]
*  I was gonna ask you, like, [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=2867.12s)]
*  what would you do in that situation? [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=2868.7599999999998s)]
*  Yeah, what was it? [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=2870.2799999999997s)]
*  So, I was at a gas station, right? [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=2872.3199999999997s)]
*  And I'm pumping gas, and there's a guy, [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=2875.04s)]
*  like right in back of me pumping gas, you know? [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=2877.4s)]
*  And he looks at me and he goes, he goes, [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=2879.96s)]
*  yo, dude, can I get a photo? [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=2881.92s)]
*  Right? [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=2885.12s)]
*  And I, dude, that day, dude, I went through it. [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=2886.2s)]
*  I was beaten down, I was tired, I was in a really bad mood, [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=2889.36s)]
*  and I go, yeah, okay. [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=2894.24s)]
*  And he goes, ah, nevermind then. [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=2897.68s)]
*  Because I wasn't enthusiastic about the photo. [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=2900.72s)]
*  Right. [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=2903.72s)]
*  You know, what does one do in that situation? [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=2904.56s)]
*  I think you just gotta respect it, [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=2907.2799999999997s)]
*  because I think it played out like it was supposed to. [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=2908.7599999999998s)]
*  But then I go, I'll take a photo, he's like, nah, man. [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=2910.56s)]
*  Now he, right? [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=2914.2400000000002s)]
*  Yeah, now you're the bad guy. [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=2915.0800000000004s)]
*  Now I'm the bad guy. [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=2916.1600000000003s)]
*  He's like, I don't want a photo with you, [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=2917.44s)]
*  because, you know what I mean, [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=2918.5600000000004s)]
*  what he's basically trying to say is, [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=2920.0400000000004s)]
*  because I wasn't like, yeah! [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=2921.84s)]
*  Let's take a photo! [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=2924.5600000000004s)]
*  You and me? [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=2926.28s)]
*  Forever! [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=2927.1200000000003s)]
*  You right? [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=2928.4s)]
*  He wanted that reaction. [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=2929.2400000000002s)]
*  When I gave him an organic, like, yeah, dude, [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=2931.2000000000003s)]
*  I didn't say this, but it's like, [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=2933.4s)]
*  I'm fucking tired, but I'll do it. [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=2934.84s)]
*  Because I've never said no to anybody. [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=2936.8s)]
*  Well, that's part of the problem. [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=2939.2400000000002s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=2940.52s)]
*  And sometimes you have to, like, [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=2941.36s)]
*  because yeah, I would be like that forever. [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=2942.44s)]
*  And now I've started to set my own boundaries, [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=2943.96s)]
*  and I was like, hey man, I'm having a bad day, [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=2945.52s)]
*  I don't feel like it, I'm at the gym, [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=2947.2400000000002s)]
*  I'm just trying to work out, or little things like that, [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=2948.88s)]
*  because you also don't want to interrupt [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=2950.84s)]
*  your train of thought sometimes, [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=2953.28s)]
*  or your imagination or whatever, [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=2954.7200000000003s)]
*  because every time you like, you know, [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=2956.2400000000002s)]
*  so sometimes that can be a bit overbearing. [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=2958.2000000000003s)]
*  You killed it in Sweet Dreams. [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=2960.64s)]
*  Oh, in the movie? [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=2963.32s)]
*  Thanks. [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=2965.36s)]
*  Killed it or not. [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=2966.2000000000003s)]
*  Thanks, dude. [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=2967.76s)]
*  Yeah, you're, I would like to make something, [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=2968.96s)]
*  I just want to make something of my own. [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=2971.0s)]
*  You will. [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=2972.76s)]
*  That's the only thing. [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=2973.6s)]
*  I don't want to be a part of something anybody else's thing. [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=2974.44s)]
*  I understand that, but the test is, [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=2977.48s)]
*  and you passed it, I think, [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=2980.04s)]
*  is to do a project that, like, you have nothing to do with, [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=2981.64s)]
*  show up and saying other people's words, [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=2985.44s)]
*  and you're doing it with real actors [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=2989.24s)]
*  and people that have been doing it for years, [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=2992.12s)]
*  and just holding your own and being natural [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=2994.32s)]
*  and being good, you know what I mean? [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=2996.4s)]
*  And so I just wanted to give you those props, you know, [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=2998.36s)]
*  because you really did kill it. [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=3001.3599999999997s)]
*  Thanks, man. [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=3003.24s)]
*  All right, you're welcome. [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=3004.08s)]

*  Where'd you learn that, I wonder? [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=3007.44s)]
*  Where'd you learn that? [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=3011.8399999999997s)]

*  It's like, if you do this next guy at clubs and colleges [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=3342.64s)]
*  and just something that's not specific, right? [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=3347.52s)]
*  The audience can tell. [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=3350.6000000000004s)]
*  There's no relationship between the two people, right? [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=3351.8s)]
*  So you put in personalized things. [[00:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=3355.5600000000004s)]
*  Do I remember when I first met this guy, [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=3358.76s)]
*  him and I had coffee, you know what I'm like? [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=3360.28s)]
*  You personalize it, right? [[00:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=3362.5200000000004s)]
*  And then you give him specific credits. [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=3364.28s)]
*  Instead of clubs and colleges, you go, [[00:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=3367.8s)]
*  dude, I saw him in an episode. [[00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=3369.36s)]
*  For me, if I brought you up, I'd be like, [[00:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=3371.1600000000003s)]

*  This guy killed it in every way. [[00:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=3375.96s)]
*  And he's killing it on his day. [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=3377.92s)]
*  You personalize it. [[00:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=3379.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=3381.1600000000003s)]
*  Yeah, to let people know that you have a real relationship. [[00:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=3382.44s)]
*  I wouldn't go Vietnam, VAW, whatever the fuck you were saying. [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=3384.92s)]
*  VFW. [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=3387.7200000000003s)]

*  Well, I'm just saying, if I took you to a VFW [[00:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=3390.84s)]

*  What is a VFW? [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=3396.2400000000002s)]

*  So we talked, from alcoholism, I'm sorry. [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=3648.28s)]
*  So we talked about that. [[01:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=3650.36s)]
*  And then we talked about why he never drank or smoked. [[01:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=3651.48s)]
*  He kind of led on that he thought [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=3654.36s)]
*  there could be some tendencies [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=3656.2s)]
*  that he could have the same thing his brother had. [[01:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=3657.36s)]
*  So I think he didn't want, you know, [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=3658.76s)]
*  he had fear about that. [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=3660.08s)]
*  I can't, you know, I don't, [[01:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=3661.96s)]
*  do you understand that or no? [[01:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=3663.52s)]
*  What, your brother having something you have you mean? [[01:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=3665.8s)]
*  No, no, no, no. [[01:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=3667.4s)]
*  Because I've met like, I remember like, [[01:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=3669.48s)]
*  Dane Cook was like that. [[01:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=3670.56s)]
*  Like I don't drink or do drugs. [[01:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=3672.28s)]
*  Carlos Mancia for a while was like that too, [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=3674.28s)]
*  where I was like, yeah, I don't touch that stuff. [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=3676.0s)]
*  Like to me, it's like, I love it. [[01:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=3677.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=3680.92s)]
*  You love it? [[01:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=3681.76s)]
*  Yeah, because I just, I think I don't, [[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=3682.6s)]
*  over time, I don't, my natural state, [[01:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=3685.12s)]
*  I think wasn't my favorite throughout my life, [[01:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=3688.0s)]
*  probably how I felt. [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=3690.68s)]
*  So if I could change that in some way, [[01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=3692.2000000000003s)]
*  then I want to do that. [[01:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=3694.44s)]
*  So those are the things you change it with either, [[01:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=3695.6s)]
*  you know, stuff like that, I think. [[01:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=3698.56s)]
*  I just don't like feelings. [[01:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=3701.12s)]
*  Yeah, wow, that's interesting. [[01:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=3703.64s)]
*  I don't, any kind, it's like I, [[01:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=3706.04s)]
*  and I'm sober now and I've been able to like kind of, [[01:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=3708.7999999999997s)]
*  what my therapist says is to like kind of just [[01:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=3712.44s)]
*  identify what you're feeling, right? [[01:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=3715.7599999999998s)]
*  And feel it, you know, and I, [[01:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=3718.7599999999998s)]
*  but I never liked them. [[01:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=3721.96s)]
*  I never liked depression or sadness or trauma or anything. [[01:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=3724.12s)]
*  I just, it doesn't sit well in my body, you know what I mean? [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=3728.44s)]
*  So it's like, I always like consume things, [[01:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=3732.92s)]
*  but it's, you know, but that's more destructive, [[01:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=3735.5200000000004s)]
*  and so that's why I'm sober. [[01:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=3738.32s)]
*  And I feel pretty free now, [[01:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=3739.5600000000004s)]
*  and I think I can handle most emotions. [[01:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=3742.1200000000003s)]
*  Well, you take on a lot more social, [[01:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=3744.4s)]
*  you've been a lot more social, [[01:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=3745.76s)]
*  I think in the past two years, it seems like. [[01:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=3746.6000000000004s)]
*  Social, what do you mean? [[01:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=3748.44s)]
*  Just like trying to stay busy, do more things, right? [[01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=3749.28s)]
*  Like actually put yourself out in the situations and stuff. [[01:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=3751.76s)]
*  Dude, I think I never, like you said, [[01:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=3755.2400000000002s)]
*  I didn't like having feelings. [[01:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=3758.08s)]
*  I like, no matter how I felt, [[01:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=3759.08s)]
*  I felt ashamed of how I felt. [[01:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=3762.7200000000003s)]
*  That was weird, you know? [[01:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=3764.48s)]
*  Yeah, like it's a lot of times I wouldn't feel good. [[01:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=3765.84s)]
*  And this, I'm trying to, I'm not getting a self pity. [[01:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=3768.0s)]
*  I'm just saying, I'm not saying this. [[01:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=3769.64s)]
*  I feel fine today, but sometimes I wouldn't feel good, [[01:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=3771.08s)]
*  and then I would feel ashamed for not feeling good. [[01:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=3773.64s)]
*  That's the part that I didn't understand sometimes, [[01:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=3776.28s)]
*  because that made it so hard to like [[01:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=3778.76s)]
*  figure out the first part, you know? [[01:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=3782.04s)]
*  Does it make any sense or no? [[01:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=3784.28s)]
*  Yeah, it makes like a lot of sense, [[01:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=3785.28s)]
*  and it just struck me that [[01:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=3787.88s)]
*  I don't wanna get too sentimental with you, [[01:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=3792.96s)]
*  but there are times where I really believe this, [[01:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=3797.32s)]
*  that I feel concerned about you. [[01:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=3799.76s)]
*  Really? [[01:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=3803.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=3804.76s)]
*  Because I, you know, I, [[01:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=3806.6000000000004s)]
*  because I don't know really what's going on. [[01:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=3809.5600000000004s)]
*  You know, I feel like, you know, [[01:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=3812.28s)]
*  there was a time where we talked more, [[01:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=3814.2s)]
*  and there was more communication. [[01:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=3817.2799999999997s)]
*  But let's face it, you've risen a little bit. [[01:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=3819.7599999999998s)]
*  I know you hate to, it's hard to hear. [[01:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=3823.2s)]
*  It's hard to hear, it's hard to hear that you've risen, [[01:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=3825.68s)]
*  but you have. [[01:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=3828.2s)]
*  Well, things have gotten, things have gotten busy. [[01:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=3829.04s)]
*  Things are so good for you, right? [[01:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=3829.8799999999997s)]
*  And I think with that rise, right, [[01:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=3832.2s)]
*  there's like more of a disconnect with your friends, [[01:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=3834.44s)]
*  because you're so busy, and you know, [[01:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=3837.8399999999997s)]
*  you're doing other things, I get it. [[01:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=3839.3999999999996s)]
*  But it's like, I'm always concerned about like, [[01:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=3841.12s)]
*  you know, if you're sober, if like, [[01:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=3843.72s)]
*  is he going to meetings, you know, is he, [[01:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=3847.16s)]
*  you know what I mean, talking to people [[01:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=3850.3199999999997s)]
*  about things that are going on, you know? [[01:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=3852.72s)]
*  I, you know, I always feel like things [[01:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=3854.4s)]
*  are probably good with you, but it's like, [[01:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=3857.3599999999997s)]
*  I have to admit that there is, you know, concern. [[01:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=3859.88s)]
*  I don't know why, I mean, because I love you. [[01:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=3864.0s)]
*  No, I appreciate it. [[01:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=3865.7999999999997s)]
*  No, I mean, I love you. [[01:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=3866.64s)]
*  Love you too. [[01:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=3868.24s)]
*  You know that, right? [[01:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=3869.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=3869.9s)]
*  Yeah, I think, yeah, it's kind of been, [[01:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=3871.18s)]
*  I know this is a comedy podcast, but it's like, [[01:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=3872.54s)]
*  you know, I just have to say that, [[01:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=3874.7799999999997s)]
*  because it's like, because I've seen it. [[01:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=3876.9799999999996s)]
*  I've seen people rise, and then, you know, they get lost. [[01:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=3879.9399999999996s)]
*  And then also there's people around them [[01:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=3884.3399999999997s)]
*  that don't necessarily care, and they're just [[01:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=3886.14s)]
*  in it for the ride. [[01:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=3888.5s)]
*  I don't know who you're surrounding yourself with, [[01:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=3889.3399999999997s)]
*  or whatever, you know what I mean? [[01:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=3890.7799999999997s)]
*  So, you know what I mean, you're probably healthy [[01:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=3892.06s)]
*  and doing well, I don't know, but it's like, [[01:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=3893.5s)]
*  there is a concern that like, you know, maybe, [[01:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=3895.74s)]
*  you know what I mean, it's alone when you get higher up. [[01:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=3899.5s)]
*  There's more loneliness. [[01:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=3903.34s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. [[01:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=3904.98s)]
*  I mean, how are you doing? I don't know. [[01:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=3906.06s)]
*  I mean, I think podcasts, it makes me feel [[01:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=3906.98s)]
*  pretty connected to people, you know? [[01:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=3908.78s)]
*  I think me not living here has been. [[01:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=3910.9s)]
*  That's a good thing. [[01:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=3913.58s)]
*  It's been good, but it's also been, [[01:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=3914.54s)]
*  I don't get to see a lot of people as much. [[01:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=3915.74s)]
*  I don't get to see a lot of my guys from AA. [[01:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=3917.22s)]
*  I think, yeah, my SOBER program hasn't been that good [[01:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=3919.56s)]
*  the past month, for sure. [[01:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=3921.86s)]
*  And so I think, really, two months, like, [[01:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=3924.42s)]
*  probably the past month, but just, yeah, [[01:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=3927.6200000000003s)]
*  not being able to like, you know, it's like, [[01:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=3929.38s)]
*  I'll work late and so then I don't want to make [[01:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=3932.1400000000003s)]
*  the morning Zoom meeting or make the, you know, [[01:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=3933.78s)]
*  and then I'll get up late and then it's like, [[01:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=3935.34s)]
*  I try to go to the gym, then I'll miss the noon [[01:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=3937.6200000000003s)]
*  in-person meeting, so just, yeah, [[01:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=3939.98s)]

*  Dude, Drew Barrymore... [[01:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=4459.6s)]
*  I swear to God, I think still hates me because of that. [[01:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=4461.6s)]
*  Wow. [[01:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=4463.6s)]
*  I'll tell you why. [[01:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=4465.6s)]
*  No, because I used to have a bowl of Vicodin [[01:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=4467.6s)]
*  in my fucking dressing room at MADtv. [[01:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=4469.6s)]
*  I just played one night. [[01:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=4471.6s)]
*  And I guess the drummer was dating [[01:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=4473.6s)]
*  Drew Barrymore. [[01:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=4475.6s)]
*  He was trying to get sober or something like that. [[01:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=4477.6s)]
*  But they all ended up going into my room [[01:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=4479.6s)]
*  and eating all my pills. [[01:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=4481.6s)]
*  Because I'm generous. [[01:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=4483.6s)]
*  Fuck it, go get it. [[01:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=4485.6s)]
*  And then I heard that she was mad at me. [[01:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=4487.6s)]
*  It's not your fault. [[01:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=4491.6s)]
*  It's not your fault that you had them. [[01:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=4493.6s)]
*  I know, that's true. [[01:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=4495.6s)]
*  It's weird to blame the dealer unless the dealer is pushing them on you. [[01:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=4497.6s)]
*  Were you pushing them on them? [[01:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=4499.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=4501.6s)]

*  Yeah, I'm listening. [[01:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=4527.6s)]
*  If I'm really mad... [[01:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=4531.6s)]
*  Well, you know, because you didn't give me your number for a long time. [[01:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=4533.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=4535.6s)]
*  But you know that when I have a resentment... [[01:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=4537.6s)]
*  I didn't know it also. [[01:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=4539.6s)]
*  Yeah, you did. Fuck off. [[01:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=4541.6s)]
*  Yeah, fuck you, dude. [[01:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=4543.6s)]
*  If I was mad at you, [[01:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=4545.6s)]
*  I'm very comfortable [[01:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=4547.6s)]
*  of going, [[01:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=4549.6s)]
*  listen, I have an issue. [[01:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=4551.6s)]
*  Have you ever had an issue with me? Be honest. [[01:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=4553.6s)]
*  Have you ever had a resentment toward me? [[01:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=4555.6s)]
*  Like, I wish he didn't do that or... [[01:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=4557.6s)]
*  No, sometimes I feel like it's a little tough to try and get to know you, kind of. [[01:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=4559.6s)]
*  But I think it's tough to try and get to know... [[01:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=4563.6s)]
*  comedians. [[01:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=4565.6s)]

*  Yeah, but that being said, I mean, I'm a comedian, right? [[01:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=4569.6s)]
*  It's hard to know any comedian. [[01:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=4571.6s)]
*  And I think everybody loves you so much that it's like you want that guy to know... [[01:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=4573.6s)]
*  You want to know that guy better, I think. [[01:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=4575.6s)]

*  But it's like, you know, we do the best we can with what we have. [[01:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=4603.6s)]
*  And what's going on, you know? [[01:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=4605.6s)]

*  Like, you know, I won't call it on a Thursday. [[01:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=4709.6s)]

*  I mean, I think that the viewers are people... [[01:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=4779.6s)]
*  I mean, are people that I would be like... [[01:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=4781.6s)]
*  I mean, there's this one girl [[01:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=4783.6s)]
*  that you used to see that I just thought [[01:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=4785.6s)]
*  you should marry, but... [[01:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=4787.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=4789.6s)]
*  I remember. [[01:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=4791.6s)]
*  I love it, dude. [[01:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=4793.6s)]
*  I just saw regret there. [[01:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=4795.6s)]
*  I just saw regret there, dude. [[01:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=4797.6s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[01:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=4799.6s)]
*  But that's the thing. I think that you and I [[01:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=4801.6s)]
*  have the same kind of issues. [[01:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=4803.6s)]
*  I think we have intimacy issues. [[01:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=4805.6s)]
*  But it's hard for us to get really vulnerable. [[01:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=4807.6s)]
*  I mean, I had that with Kaila [[01:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=4809.6s)]
*  for ten years, but she was the first one [[01:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=4811.6s)]
*  in many, many years that I could do that with. [[01:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=4813.6s)]
*  There's just something about her [[01:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=4815.6s)]
*  that I was able to... [[01:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=4817.6s)]
*  We were able to do that, right? [[01:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=4819.6s)]
*  But did the intimacy freeze up after a while? [[01:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=4821.6s)]
*  Like, it was hard to be like [[01:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=4823.6s)]
*  sensual or whatever? [[01:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=4825.6s)]
*  You know, the truth is, [[01:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=4827.6s)]
*  I think that... [[01:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=4829.6s)]
*  Oh, God, I can't fucking... [[01:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=4831.6s)]
*  I think it's this. [[01:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=4833.6s)]
*  You want me to say f*** it or not? [[01:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=4835.6s)]
*  No, no, no, no. [[01:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=4837.6s)]
*  I want to say that. Don't say that. [[01:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=4839.6s)]
*  But what I want to say is [[01:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=4841.6s)]
*  the problem with us, because [[01:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=4843.6s)]
*  number one, [[01:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=4845.6s)]
*  we go up on stage. [[01:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=4847.6s)]
*  And what's more exciting than that? [[01:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=4849.6s)]
*  The business inherently [[01:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=4851.6s)]
*  is super exciting, [[01:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=4853.6s)]
*  and there's dopamine hits. [[01:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=4855.6s)]
*  Right, I'm going to get a lot of feeling from right there. [[01:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=4857.6s)]
*  Right. [[01:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=4859.6s)]
*  And so then also, you and I are also [[01:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=4861.6s)]
*  recovering drug addicts, [[01:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=4863.6s)]
*  so we like [[01:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=4865.6s)]
*  excitement, right? [[01:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=4867.6s)]
*  And we don't like the same old thing. [[01:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=4869.6s)]
*  Right? So there is something [[01:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=4871.6s)]
*  about meeting somebody new, [[01:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=4873.6s)]
*  right? Right, it's almost like you get that, yeah. [[01:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=4875.6s)]
*  You get that forgetful syndrome. [[01:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=4877.6s)]
*  Right. But at the end [[01:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=4879.6s)]
*  of the day, and I've never said [[01:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=4881.6s)]
*  this out loud before, [[01:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=4883.6s)]
*  and I think I [[01:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=4885.6s)]
*  f***ed it up with Kalyla. And I think [[01:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=4887.6s)]
*  that I wish I would have done it over again. [[01:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=4889.6s)]
*  Because that would have changed some things. Right? [[01:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=4891.6s)]
*  At this point, it's too late. [[01:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=4893.6s)]
*  You know what I mean? We both have moved on. [[01:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=4895.6s)]
*  But there's a lot of regret [[01:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=4897.6s)]
*  there. I [[01:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=4899.6s)]
*  and I swear to God, dude, [[01:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=4901.6s)]
*  I will, the next girl I meet [[01:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=4907.6s)]
*  that, you know, and there's a couple of girls [[01:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=4909.6s)]
*  that have potential, I'll be honest with you, [[01:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=4911.6s)]
*  right now. But the next [[01:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=4913.6s)]
*  thing, I'm going to do it differently. [[01:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=4915.6s)]
*  Number one, I'm going to get [[01:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=4917.6s)]
*  rid of all my machines. [[01:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=4919.6s)]
*  Wow, really? Yep. [[01:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=4921.6s)]
*  I have a vacuum cleaner. [[01:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=4923.6s)]
*  And what is that, like a sex thing [[01:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=4927.6s)]
*  or something? Oh, you mean an actual [[01:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=4929.6s)]
*  carpet cleaner? No. [[01:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=4931.6s)]
*  Dude, I showed up at Bad Friends [[01:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=4933.6s)]
*  one day, and somebody had sent me [[01:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=4935.6s)]
*  something that, I swear to God, [[01:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=4937.6s)]
*  is the size of a vacuum [[01:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=4939.6s)]
*  cleaner. Right? [[01:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=4941.6s)]
*  It was like this big, with all these tubes [[01:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=4943.6s)]
*  and stuff. It was a sex toy. [[01:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=4945.6s)]
*  No. Yeah. [[01:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=4947.6s)]
*  Of course, I took it home. And you used it? [[01:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=4949.6s)]
*  I plugged it in. I have so many [[01:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=4951.6s)]
*  of them. Oh. I have [[01:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=4953.6s)]
*  so many of them. And I stick it in, [[01:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=4955.6s)]
*  doot doot doot doot doot. [[01:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=4957.6s)]
*  And what does it play? [[01:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=4959.6s)]
*  It just Beethoven's here or whatever? [[01:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=4961.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=4963.6s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[01:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=4965.6s)]
*  It's a, right? [[01:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=4967.6s)]
*  And you doot doot doot. [[01:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=4969.6s)]
*  What? [[01:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=4971.6s)]
*  What? [[01:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=4973.6s)]
*  Doot doot doot. [[01:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=4975.6s)]
*  Doot doot doot. [[01:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=4977.6s)]
*  Hey, put it on Christmas. [[01:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=4979.6s)]
*  Jingle bell, [[01:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=4981.6s)]
*  jingle bell, jingle bell. [[01:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=4983.6s)]
*  I swear to God, these new [[01:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=4985.6s)]
*  machines, dude, it sucks [[01:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=4987.6s)]
*  you in, dude. See, I don't do any of that. [[01:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=4989.6s)]
*  They never let go, dude. I'm 80 days off pornography [[01:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=4991.6s)]
*  right now. Wow. I'm going to give you [[01:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=4993.6s)]
*  a machine, man. No. Please. [[01:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=4995.6s)]
*  I don't want anything like that. I know, but I'm going to, I know. [[01:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=4997.6s)]
*  But you gotta try it. What does it do? [[01:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=4999.6s)]
*  It does three things. [[01:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=5001.6s)]
*  Okay. Okay. [[01:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=5003.6s)]
*  Not just one thing, dude. Okay. Okay. [[01:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=5005.6s)]
*  Is it gas power or do you plug it in? [[01:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=5007.6s)]
*  No, it's not gas. The vacuum cleaner I will probably not use again [[01:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=5009.6s)]
*  because I almost, I had to grab parts of my penis [[01:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=5011.6s)]
*  inside the fucking little filter there, right? [[01:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=5013.6s)]
*  But it took stuff out. [[01:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=5015.6s)]
*  So it was too powerful, okay? But I want to say this, [[01:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=5017.6s)]
*  okay? I have one that I bought [[01:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=5019.6s)]
*  at the Hustler store. Yeah. Right? [[01:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=5021.6s)]
*  And it does three things. [[01:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=5023.6s)]
*  Really just [[01:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=5025.6s)]
*  two things. [[01:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=5027.6s)]
*  It vibrates [[01:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=5029.6s)]
*  and sucks. [[01:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=5031.6s)]
*  Wow. Right? [[01:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=5033.6s)]
*  And so, you know what I mean? Does it sort coins? [[01:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=5035.6s)]
*  I think it might. [[01:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=5037.6s)]
*  Hell yeah. Yeah, I think it might. Yeah, yeah. [[01:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=5039.6s)]
*  How long do you have to stay on it for eight seconds? [[01:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=5041.6s)]
*  No, what I do is I, um, [[01:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=5043.6s)]
*  it's also waterproof. That's a key. [[01:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=5045.6s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. [[01:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=5047.6s)]
*  But, so, yeah, I know. [[01:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=5049.6s)]
*  So the next relationship I met, [[01:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=5051.6s)]
*  that's what you do? [[01:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=5053.6s)]
*  It makes me just... No, daddy, no. [[01:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=5055.6s)]
*  Daddy sounds like a man, dude. [[01:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=5057.6s)]
*  What? Daddy sounds like a man. [[01:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=5059.6s)]
*  Yeah, dude, yeah. [[01:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=5061.6s)]
*  It better be a chick named Daddy. [[01:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=5063.6s)]
*  Yeah, don't do... [[01:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=5065.6s)]
*  Do you miss your dad? [[01:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=5067.6s)]
*  Huh? Yeah, I miss [[01:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=5069.6s)]
*  my dad, dude. When did he die? [[01:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=5071.6s)]
*  What year did he die? [[01:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=5073.6s)]
*  Bring up a picture of my dad. [[01:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=5075.6s)]
*  He died in [[01:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=5077.6s)]
*  1996. [[01:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=5079.6s)]
*  Do you miss him, though? [[01:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=5081.6s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah, I didn't... [[01:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=5083.6s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=5085.6s)]
*  Because I didn't, like... [[01:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=5087.6s)]
*  Yeah, I miss him. I just wish that I knew him better, you know? [[01:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=5089.6s)]
*  Do you miss your dad? Yeah, I... [[01:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=5091.6s)]
*  Dude, you just hit it on the fucking nail [[01:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=5093.6s)]
*  on the coffin. [[01:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=5095.6s)]
*  Was that the wrong way to say it? [[01:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=5097.6s)]
*  You hit the nail. [[01:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=5099.6s)]
*  Um, [[01:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=5101.6s)]
*  I... Here's the thing. [[01:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=5103.6s)]
*  I don't know nothing about him. [[01:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=5105.6s)]
*  Really? [[01:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=5107.6s)]
*  Because my dad didn't speak English. [[01:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=5109.6s)]
*  Right? And I barely spoke Korean. [[01:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=5111.6s)]
*  So everything was like, [[01:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=5113.6s)]
*  for instance, [[01:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=5115.6s)]
*  you know, like, when you're in high school, [[01:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=5117.6s)]
*  for instance, and you're going... Let's say I was a white kid. [[01:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=5119.6s)]
*  I was going out, and your dad gives you, like, [[01:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=5121.6s)]
*  a little pep talk, like, you know, don't drink and drive, right? [[01:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=5123.6s)]
*  Also, you know, if you're in trouble, [[01:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=5125.6s)]
*  give me a call, or whatever. [[01:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=5127.6s)]
*  Whatever they say, you know what I mean? [[01:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=5129.6s)]
*  But my dad didn't do that. He would just go... [[01:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=5131.6s)]
*  I go, goodbye, Dad. [[01:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=5133.6s)]
*  He go, don't do. [[01:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=5135.6s)]
*  And I go, I won't do. [[01:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=5137.6s)]
*  I mean, that's it. [[01:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=5139.6s)]
*  That's it. [[01:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=5141.6s)]
*  If I ask my dad, um, [[01:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=5143.6s)]
*  tell me about how you feel. [[01:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=5145.6s)]
*  I don't know. Good. [[01:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=5147.6s)]
*  But they don't like. [[01:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=5149.6s)]
*  And you're like, what the fuck are you talking about? [[01:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=5151.6s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah, what's your favorite pasta? [[01:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=5153.6s)]
*  Oh, I like, you know, [[01:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=5155.6s)]
*  it's very good. You know? [[01:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=5157.6s)]
*  Like, he does... Dude. [[01:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=5159.6s)]
*  Bro, bro, bro. He never... [[01:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=5161.6s)]
*  Bro. [[01:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=5163.6s)]
*  He didn't know what music was! [[01:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=5165.6s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[01:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=5167.6s)]
*  He didn't know what music was! [[01:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=5169.6s)]
*  Yeah, dude. Right? [[01:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=5171.6s)]
*  So when he... He had a stroke, right? [[01:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=5173.6s)]
*  Oh, gosh. I didn't know that. [[01:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=5175.6s)]
*  I knew your dad passed away. [[01:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=5177.6s)]
*  I didn't know he had a stroke. Yeah, he had many strokes. [[01:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=5179.6s)]
*  So he had two major strokes and a couple of mini ones. [[01:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=5181.6s)]
*  Different strokes. You ever seen that show? [[01:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=5183.6s)]
*  Yeah, I love it, dude. [[01:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=5185.6s)]
*  Yeah, he had two, you know, Willis's. [[01:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=5187.6s)]
*  What you talking about, Willis? You know what I mean? [[01:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=5189.6s)]
*  Anyway, um, great show. [[01:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=5191.6s)]
*  Oh, yeah, and one Mr. Drummond. [[01:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=5193.6s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[01:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=5195.6s)]
*  That's the one that really shook him. [[01:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=5197.6s)]
*  So what was I... Oh, what I was saying. [[01:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=5199.6s)]
*  Oh, so he had a bunch of strokes, and I had, like, [[01:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=5201.6s)]
*  AirPods. [[01:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=5203.6s)]
*  And I was at his house in Phoenix. [[01:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=5205.6s)]
*  And I go, um, [[01:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=5207.6s)]
*  Dad, you know, [[01:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=5209.6s)]
*  he goes, yeah? [[01:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=5211.6s)]
*  I go, will you listen to music for the first time? [[01:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=5213.6s)]
*  I mean, he'd obviously, he's been in a little mall. [[01:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=5215.6s)]
*  Yeah. He's heard it, right? [[01:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=5217.6s)]
*  But he doesn't know... [[01:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=5219.6s)]
*  He doesn't know what the Bannin' Fair band or... [[01:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=5221.6s)]
*  He doesn't know what Beethoven is or whatever. [[01:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=5223.6s)]
*  And so I put in Eric Clapton's... [[01:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=5225.6s)]
*  What's it? [[01:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=5227.6s)]
*  Tears in Heaven. [[01:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=5229.6s)]
*  I put it in, my Steve was there too, my brother. [[01:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=5231.6s)]
*  And we pushed play. [[01:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=5233.6s)]
*  And tears [[01:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=5237.6s)]
*  came down my dad's face. [[01:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=5239.6s)]
*  No way. Right? [[01:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=5241.6s)]
*  It was the first time he goes, [[01:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=5243.6s)]
*  Dad, beautiful. [[01:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=5245.6s)]
*  Wow. [[01:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=5247.6s)]
*  And then he died. [[01:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=5249.6s)]
*  Damn. Yeah. [[01:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=5251.6s)]
*  So he didn't know, I didn't learn anything from the dude. [[01:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=5253.6s)]
*  But were you ashamed of him, [[01:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=5255.6s)]
*  it feels like? You were embarrassed by him for some reason? [[01:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=5257.6s)]
*  I hated him. [[01:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=5261.6s)]
*  And, you know, I've told this story before, [[01:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=5263.6s)]
*  but not on this, I don't think. [[01:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=5265.6s)]
*  Um, when I was... [[01:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=5267.6s)]
*  I've told this a couple of times. [[01:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=5269.6s)]
*  Do you mind if I tell the story? Yeah, no, I haven't heard it. [[01:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=5271.6s)]
*  Yeah, I don't know it. [[01:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=5273.6s)]
*  You know, who do I live with? [[01:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=5275.6s)]
*  Your friends? [[01:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=5277.6s)]
*  Noah. [[01:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=5279.6s)]
*  I have cats. [[01:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=5281.6s)]
*  Oh yeah, I have three cats. [[01:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=5283.6s)]
*  Yeah, I think you have a couple of cats. [[01:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=5285.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=5287.6s)]
*  And so when I was a kid, I loved them. [[01:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=5289.6s)]
*  Something about them, the cats. [[01:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=5291.6s)]
*  Just cats in general. Yeah. [[01:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=5293.6s)]
*  And when I was eight, I go, [[01:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=5295.6s)]
*  um, [[01:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=5297.6s)]
*  could I get a cat? [[01:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=5299.6s)]
*  And they got me a cat, a kitten. [[01:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=5301.6s)]
*  I named him Tommy. [[01:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=5303.6s)]
*  We wouldn't put him in the house. [[01:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=5305.6s)]
*  We put him in the garage, we had like a little fence thing in the garage. [[01:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=5307.6s)]
*  That's fair. Yeah. [[01:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=5309.6s)]
*  Good compromise. And then over the summer, [[01:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=5311.6s)]
*  every day, I just sat with Tommy, [[01:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=5313.6s)]
*  eight hours a day, [[01:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=5315.6s)]
*  he was the love of my life. [[01:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=5317.6s)]
*  And then one day, [[01:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=5319.6s)]
*  a couple of months later, three months later, [[01:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=5321.6s)]
*  I go to the garage, he's completely gone. [[01:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=5323.6s)]
*  So I go, [[01:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=5325.6s)]
*  Mom, Dad! And they came in the garage. [[01:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=5327.6s)]
*  I go, where's Tom? [[01:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=5329.6s)]
*  And my dad goes, [[01:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=5331.6s)]
*  Mommy, she a logic. [[01:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=5333.6s)]
*  And I go, uh-huh. [[01:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=5335.6s)]
*  He said, Tom gone. [[01:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=5337.6s)]
*  And he goes, Stop crying! [[01:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=5339.6s)]
*  And then he just left the garage. [[01:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=5341.6s)]
*  There was like no room for compromise, [[01:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=5343.6s)]
*  or anything, like whatever he's... [[01:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=5345.6s)]
*  That's why I hate authority figures. [[01:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=5347.6s)]
*  Right? [[01:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=5349.6s)]
*  There was no room for discussion. [[01:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=5351.6s)]
*  I didn't know where Tom went. [[01:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=5353.6s)]
*  Stop crying, shut the fuck up, [[01:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=5355.6s)]
*  and that's it. [[01:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=5357.6s)]
*  And that was the day where I looked at my parents [[01:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=5359.6s)]
*  and I went, [[01:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=5361.6s)]
*  Okay, it's war. [[01:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=5363.6s)]
*  It's war. [[01:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=5365.6s)]
*  I started doing drugs. [[01:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=5367.6s)]
*  Raising hell. [[01:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=5369.6s)]
*  Lighting things on fire. [[01:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=5371.6s)]
*  Embarrassed the family. [[01:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=5373.6s)]
*  That's why, if I had a kid, [[01:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=5375.6s)]
*  I mean, how would you approach that? [[01:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=5377.6s)]
*  I was a kid, [[01:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=5379.6s)]
*  your wife is allergic [[01:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k12XgAXWcw&t=5381.6s)]
