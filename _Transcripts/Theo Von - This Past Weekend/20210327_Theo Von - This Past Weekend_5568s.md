*  like Chris was popular before I had any popularity, right, you know and [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld3gFs4E69E&t=1317.28s)]
*  He was hard to get to know [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld3gFs4E69E&t=1322.28s)]
*  You know, yeah, but I think he was in his addiction man [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld3gFs4E69E&t=1324.92s)]
*  I literally like when I think back on it watching him like text women [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld3gFs4E69E&t=1327.84s)]
*  It was like watching somebody use heroin in front of you. Don't think of it like that [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld3gFs4E69E&t=1331.52s)]

*  I think I do bro. Yeah, but here's my question for you is this man. Do you think there should be some liability? [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld3gFs4E69E&t=1352.3999999999999s)]
*  For Instagram and for these services that allow people to connect [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld3gFs4E69E&t=1359.6399999999999s)]
*  I don't think that you should be able to follow anybody under 18 or communicate. They can't put a barrier between [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld3gFs4E69E&t=1364.32s)]

*  And snapchat is probably the worst. That's why I don't even fuck with snapchat, but like [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld3gFs4E69E&t=1386.56s)]

*  I think so because it's like do I have the control or not to let this thing influence me that much from a drop a hand to [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld3gFs4E69E&t=1578.56s)]

*  Did you enjoy your childhood? [[01:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld3gFs4E69E&t=3923.64s)]
*  I think I did in hindsight. It was just scare [[01:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld3gFs4E69E&t=3926.2s)]
*  I felt like it was scary cuz like a lot of dangerous kind of whites and dangerous blacks [[01:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld3gFs4E69E&t=3929.04s)]
*  I felt like I was also like real scared. So I think I was like scared of everything, you know [[01:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld3gFs4E69E&t=3933.48s)]
*  But I was also like, you know, and I could do anything I wanted there was nobody keeping [[01:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld3gFs4E69E&t=3938.48s)]
*  You know it like, you know, I was supposed to drink milk and fucking be alive for like 15 years [[01:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld3gFs4E69E&t=3944.52s)]
*  I like that was like kind of the guidance. You know took care of you. Yeah, there was just no like [[01:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld3gFs4E69E&t=3949.58s)]
*  Like everything was like yeah, it was just kind of like nobody ever checked in to see what was going on. It was [[01:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld3gFs4E69E&t=3955.72s)]
*  It was like somebody started me at the top of it [[01:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld3gFs4E69E&t=3963.3199999999997s)]
*  I may check in with you sometime, but in hindsight, it was fun, you know, yeah, we lived in a fun area man [[01:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld3gFs4E69E&t=3969.4s)]
*  We lived in a fun area speak about it a lot and I think in a way that's I [[01:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld3gFs4E69E&t=3976.48s)]
*  Don't know loving and like cherished [[01:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld3gFs4E69E&t=3981.1200000000003s)]
*  But the stories can often be traumatizing but I don't know seems like you're kind of happy with them [[01:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld3gFs4E69E&t=3984.6800000000003s)]
*  Yeah, I think for a long time I wasn't cuz I think they were traumatizing and then you've kind of dealt with them and accepted them [[01:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld3gFs4E69E&t=3990.08s)]
*  Yeah, I just think as I grow older. I realized that well also we need good stories. Mmm [[01:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld3gFs4E69E&t=3996.56s)]
*  There's not a lot of people out there telling stories anymore. Mmm. It's almost like in Hollywood everything gets so like chopped down [[01:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld3gFs4E69E&t=4001.48s)]
*  I feel like a lot of times that they don't let you tell the good story or even the true story [[01:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld3gFs4E69E&t=4007.48s)]
*  like you can't tell a story like and you can't tell a story a lot of even true stories about like race and stuff sometimes because [[01:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld3gFs4E69E&t=4011.64s)]
*  They act like sometimes as a white person if you say the word black or if you say it or if you say something about [[01:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld3gFs4E69E&t=4017.68s)]
*  Like like two of my best black friends got killed by other black guys, right? Yeah, so I don't like [[01:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld3gFs4E69E&t=4022.36s)]
*  That shit makes me mad, right? [[01:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld3gFs4E69E&t=4029.0s)]
*  when I see a lot of stuff like first 48 and those type of shows where there's a lot of black on black crime and you see [[01:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld3gFs4E69E&t=4030.76s)]
*  There's white people making money off the show [[01:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld3gFs4E69E&t=4036.2400000000002s)]
*  I'm sure who have you follow the makers of the show. Yeah, it's gonna get a little funny [[01:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld3gFs4E69E&t=4038.2400000000002s)]
*  He's not going back into the community. Yeah, it's not right, right? Right. It's not going into fucking Memphis. Let's just say Memphis [[01:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld3gFs4E69E&t=4042.92s)]
*  Okay, I think Memphis needs it. Yeah, they're just going [[01:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld3gFs4E69E&t=4050.04s)]
*  I hope someone gets murdered in this 48-hour period because that's what the show is [[01:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld3gFs4E69E&t=4053.28s)]
*  There's a producer that show it is going to work every week going. I hope someone gets murdered Jesus Christ [[01:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld3gFs4E69E&t=4057.28s)]
*  Oh [[01:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld3gFs4E69E&t=4063.16s)]
*  Damn, it's Easter. Fuck. It's always slow around this time of year. You know I'm saying yeah [[01:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld3gFs4E69E&t=4064.3599999999997s)]
*  Groundhog's day we're gonna have another three weeks of winter or whatever [[01:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld3gFs4E69E&t=4068.96s)]
*  But I just said like I feel like sometimes it's like if I say [[01:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld3gFs4E69E&t=4072.3199999999997s)]
*  That man, I feel like sometimes it's just this scares me [[01:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld3gFs4E69E&t=4076.04s)]
*  How much black on black crime there is that people think that I'm against like like I want black people to live and prosper [[01:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld3gFs4E69E&t=4080.0s)]
*  I don't it's not like I'm a then think it's a like that black people are bad. Does that make any sense? [[01:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld3gFs4E69E&t=4086.12s)]
*  Yeah, I think that the tricky thing with that is just like [[01:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld3gFs4E69E&t=4090.8799999999997s)]
*  All crime is usually committed within the same race because most people just live around their race, right? [[01:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld3gFs4E69E&t=4094.04s)]
*  So I think the term to a lot of people is like well black and black crimes [[01:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld3gFs4E69E&t=4100.32s)]
*  White and white crime like white people are murdering white people like all these serial killers [[01:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld3gFs4E69E&t=4105.76s)]
*  Often are just murdering white chicks. You watch any these documentaries just a white dude murdering white chicks [[01:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld3gFs4E69E&t=4109.84s)]
*  That's not white and white crime. That's easy to let's be honest dude. It was so where's the white dude murdering black chicks [[01:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld3gFs4E69E&t=4114.16s)]
*  that [[01:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld3gFs4E69E&t=4120.96s)]

*  Maybe black on black cuz maybe you just see more. I mean, maybe it's cuz there's shows like that, you know [[01:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld3gFs4E69E&t=4177.16s)]
*  Yeah, I don't know but there's there's no doubt that there's black on black ground. I think anybody denies that right? [[01:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld3gFs4E69E&t=4182.48s)]
*  But what I hate is or maybe it's maybe in the car be in my head [[01:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld3gFs4E69E&t=4187.88s)]
*  But it's like if I say that I feel so no, it's like oh then people think I'm against black people [[01:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld3gFs4E69E&t=4190.6s)]
*  It's like no, no, no, I don't think that I want black people. Yeah, I want I just want everybody [[01:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld3gFs4E69E&t=4195.68s)]
*  Yeah, I don't know that there's a disproportionate amount of crime in that community and you just want that to stop right? [[01:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld3gFs4E69E&t=4201.2s)]
*  Yeah, it just like bums me out and it seems almost like there's way more [[01:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld3gFs4E69E&t=4207.04s)]
*  News or media attention to when like the police do something to a black person [[01:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld3gFs4E69E&t=4211.72s)]
*  Then when black people are affected within their own community [[01:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld3gFs4E69E&t=4216.28s)]
*  It just seems that way because the media is selling the the sexiest story like right now [[01:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld3gFs4E69E&t=4219.0599999999995s)]
*  Stop Asian hate is the story and a few years ago. It was [[01:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld3gFs4E69E&t=4224.04s)]
*  Anti Muslim violence was the story right so anything happened to a Muslim that was the [[01:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld3gFs4E69E&t=4227.96s)]
*  Her slims we call slims slims, you know, I mean [[01:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld3gFs4E69E&t=4233.5199999999995s)]
*  Raleigh you get a lot of Asian hate wherever you're from you get it [[01:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld3gFs4E69E&t=4237.48s)]
*  I don't and we got a real Asian right here. And what do you say about it? [[01:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld3gFs4E69E&t=4240.32s)]
*  If somebody throws something at you, that's hate, right? [[01:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld3gFs4E69E&t=4244.799999999999s)]
*  Yeah, what they throw you no, but I'm just saying if I'm trying to see what is Asian hate. Oh, I know it's shootings [[01:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld3gFs4E69E&t=4248.0s)]
*  That's easy. Yeah, man. It's tricky with the Asian hate though [[01:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld3gFs4E69E&t=4255.28s)]
*  because the the tough thing about Asians is like there are like Asians that are [[01:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld3gFs4E69E&t=4258.88s)]
*  Here way longer than maybe either of us. I just been here forever, but because they look Asian [[01:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld3gFs4E69E&t=4263.5599999999995s)]
*  I think there are certain Americans that just don't see them as American [[01:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld3gFs4E69E&t=4269.38s)]
*  You know, it's just for whatever reason like I think the idea of America for a lot of people is white and black [[01:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld3gFs4E69E&t=4272.84s)]
*  Even non racist people they're just like white and black people. That's what makes up Americans, right? [[01:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld3gFs4E69E&t=4280.08s)]
*  And everybody else just kind of got to like pick a an identity or side [[01:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld3gFs4E69E&t=4285.96s)]
*  So if you're Asian or if you're like Indian or you're what's another one? I don't know some other one [[01:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld3gFs4E69E&t=4290.88s)]
*  We just got to go. How am I gonna act? Am I gonna act kind of like culturally white or am I gonna act culturally black? [[01:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld3gFs4E69E&t=4296.160000000001s)]
*  Oh, that's true [[01:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld3gFs4E69E&t=4302.120000000001s)]
*  Well, I think but and also some of that is just cuz those are our two kind of leading vibes [[01:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld3gFs4E69E&t=4303.04s)]
*  Country and they're the most they're the most prevalent and they've been here the longest right? [[01:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld3gFs4E69E&t=4307.8s)]
*  So everybody kind of try to fit I'm sure if we moved from China [[01:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld3gFs4E69E&t=4312.08s)]
*  I start look like one of the day for boom I get I will get a little bit Asian. Yes [[01:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld3gFs4E69E&t=4315.12s)]
*  I'll start to kind of yeah, I'll do just little things. I see them do [[01:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld3gFs4E69E&t=4320.3s)]
*  Yeah, I start to do it. I move quickly shit on the sidewalk [[01:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld3gFs4E69E&t=4323.92s)]
*  Shit on the sidewalk fit I'll cough into my fucking child's mouth [[01:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld3gFs4E69E&t=4328.32s)]
*  So it doesn't get out into the air [[01:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld3gFs4E69E&t=4331.96s)]
*  But they'll do that kind of stuff bro the Chinese dog, let's let's be honest about the Chinese like that's one thing [[01:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld3gFs4E69E&t=4333.92s)]
*  I don't like sometimes it's like America. We have to make every moment in America [[01:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld3gFs4E69E&t=4340.4800000000005s)]
*  Acceptable for everyone in some magical fucking way. Yeah, bro. You go to fucking dude. I went to a bar [[01:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld3gFs4E69E&t=4344.88s)]
*  I went to China. They don't give up bro. You die in China [[01:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld3gFs4E69E&t=4350.92s)]
*  They make a fucking soup out of you. They feed the fucking people are hungry, bro. And they cruise [[01:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld3gFs4E69E&t=4355.66s)]
*  Shit moves on dog shit [[01:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld3gFs4E69E&t=4362.24s)]
*  I mean and they'll do that in an eight-minute set run and that's just how they they know it's not like [[01:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld3gFs4E69E&t=4364.0s)]
*  Life doesn't I'm not saying it's their lives aren't as important as anybody else [[01:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld3gFs4E69E&t=4369.92s)]
*  But life doesn't the way we feel about life doesn't me it's not the same rules and important [[01:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld3gFs4E69E&t=4373.08s)]
*  Yes, and everybody should care about us and there the community is more important [[01:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld3gFs4E69E&t=4378.2s)]
*  And yes, individual is not as valued and the individual serves the community [[01:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld3gFs4E69E&t=4384.12s)]
*  I think the idea of the mask is not you're gonna get me sick [[01:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld3gFs4E69E&t=4388.36s)]
*  The idea of the mask is I'm sick. I might get you sick and I don't want to be a burden on my community [[01:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld3gFs4E69E&t=4393.04s)]
*  That's the Asian idea the mask which is pretty lit when you think about it [[01:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld3gFs4E69E&t=4399.96s)]
*  But of course when we see agents with masks like five years ago like or three years before Corona [[01:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld3gFs4E69E&t=4403.639999999999s)]
*  We're just like Michael Jackson fan [[01:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld3gFs4E69E&t=4407.759999999999s)]
*  Michael Jackson fan or we're just like what are you trying to say our airs dirty, right? [[01:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld3gFs4E69E&t=4410.48s)]
*  What are you trying to say we got we got disease like we saw it as an insult instead of them being considerate [[01:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld3gFs4E69E&t=4415.24s)]
*  Oh, yeah. Yeah, and that's part of is just the vibe in America is like [[01:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld3gFs4E69E&t=4420.639999999999s)]
*  I can do whatever about me and we've had so much freedom [[01:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld3gFs4E69E&t=4425.08s)]
*  Yeah, we've had so we have extra freedom freedom is lit if you know what freedom is [[01:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld3gFs4E69E&t=4427.88s)]
*  But if you never have freedom, you don't care, right? You know, right? Oh, yeah, like you don't know what you're missing [[01:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld3gFs4E69E&t=4433.4s)]
*  Exactly, like there I'm sure there's guys that do some like crazy sex move or whatever like that, right and like [[01:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld3gFs4E69E&t=4439.28s)]
*  Once they know what it is. They love it. Their girl loves it. But like I don't know what that is [[01:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld3gFs4E69E&t=4444.719999999999s)]
*  I don't know that I don't know what the fuck I'm missing out. So I'm good [[01:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld3gFs4E69E&t=4448.24s)]
*  Yeah, and I think that's what we think people in China are like, don't you miss this freedom? [[01:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld3gFs4E69E&t=4451.799999999999s)]
*  You gotta do whatever the government tells you and they're like we never had freedom [[01:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld3gFs4E69E&t=4456.2s)]
*  Yeah, this is all we know and everybody around us gets the same shit. So it's fine [[01:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld3gFs4E69E&t=4458.96s)]
*  Yeah, and it works it works and I wonder it starts to wonder if maybe we're getting to the part of capitalism where things [[01:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld3gFs4E69E&t=4462.5199999999995s)]
*  Don't really work as cool as it [[01:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld3gFs4E69E&t=4468.839999999999s)]
*  Think about that sometimes [[01:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld3gFs4E69E&t=4471.719999999999s)]
*  Yeah, cuz like I wonder if like capitalism is just like your teenage years [[01:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld3gFs4E69E&t=4472.72s)]
*  right and then like [[01:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld3gFs4E69E&t=4479.0s)]
*  Like cuz America's young like this people gotta realize like this is a good podcast man. Let's realize this is fun [[01:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld3gFs4E69E&t=4481.12s)]
*  This is fun. But like America's so young bro, like Europeans. I think a lot of times they like judge us, right and Europeans [[01:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld3gFs4E69E&t=4485.96s)]
*  I think you're gonna get all the history. They got all the ships, but I'm telling like I'm like guys [[01:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld3gFs4E69E&t=4492.76s)]
*  One we don't care cuz nobody cares about y'all but at the same time like you had thousands of years to develop your culture in ways [[01:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld3gFs4E69E&t=4498.4800000000005s)]
*  Right [[01:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld3gFs4E69E&t=4505.1s)]
*  We're figuring it out. We just got money. All of us. Yeah, we're poor everybody [[01:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld3gFs4E69E&t=4506.280000000001s)]
*  Came from poverty like yeah, my dad probably came for a little money [[01:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld3gFs4E69E&t=4512.400000000001s)]
*  But if you go to his dad or his dad poor my mom poor, right? [[01:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld3gFs4E69E&t=4516.400000000001s)]
*  Everybody in America is a few generations or 99% of people are a few generations away from dirt poor [[01:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld3gFs4E69E&t=4521.5199999999995s)]
*  Yeah, so we got some money. So we don't spend the money reflection right now [[01:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld3gFs4E69E&t=4527.44s)]
*  You see what the slims are doing out there in the Middle East, right? Molly percus. Yeah [[01:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld3gFs4E69E&t=4531.0s)]
*  Building islands out of sand and look like a billion pussies out of [[01:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld3gFs4E69E&t=4534.96s)]
*  Sandpusses [[01:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld3gFs4E69E&t=4541.679999999999s)]
*  But you know, they're making them yeah, no out of fucking say that's [[01:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld3gFs4E69E&t=4543.92s)]
*  What they're doing [[01:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld3gFs4E69E&t=4547.96s)]
*  They're making cold say [[01:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld3gFs4E69E&t=4550.08s)]
*  But you're right it's like yeah, we're in this teenage years, but I wonder how does this shit in like go in the social is [[01:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld3gFs4E69E&t=4553.76s)]
*  I I don't even like saying it because it sounds like some like Bernie shit or whatever like oh we gotta give everybody money [[01:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld3gFs4E69E&t=4560.08s)]
*  blah blah blah, but I think what happens is it becomes like Europe is a [[01:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld3gFs4E69E&t=4565.04s)]
*  Thousand years ahead of us, right? [[01:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld3gFs4E69E&t=4569.52s)]
*  And I think they're like [[01:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld3gFs4E69E&t=4571.04s)]
*  Okay in order for us not to have this crazy division and in order for us not to be killing everybody in order for us not [[01:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld3gFs4E69E&t=4572.64s)]
*  To everybody hate each other [[01:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld3gFs4E69E&t=4578.900000000001s)]
*  we kind of need to spread the wealth in a way and provide health care in a way where everybody has a decent opportunity at [[01:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld3gFs4E69E&t=4580.320000000001s)]
*  Success in this country. That's I think that's what it eventually gravitates to because there's a reason every fucking country in Europe [[01:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld3gFs4E69E&t=4588.200000000001s)]
*  Has the kind of similar socialist system and every country in Europe is a few thousand years old. Hmm [[01:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld3gFs4E69E&t=4594.64s)]
*  So I assume we don't have to force it now [[01:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld3gFs4E69E&t=4600.04s)]
*  But I assume we will slowly gravitate towards that and we kind of are already when you think about it [[01:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld3gFs4E69E&t=4602.84s)]
*  But a lot of that is also rich people just hiding behind the government to make poor people feel okay. Yeah, which is also okay [[01:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld3gFs4E69E&t=4609.400000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I don't know exactly. I don't know the long-term effects of that though rich people hiding behind the government to make poor people feel [[01:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld3gFs4E69E&t=4617.96s)]
*  Okay, what does that mean again? I don't know. Is that socialism? I don't know exactly what socialism is [[01:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld3gFs4E69E&t=4623.68s)]
*  It's just tax a little bit more and like giving poor people a little bit more so they're not struggling right? [[01:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld3gFs4E69E&t=4629.64s)]
*  Right, right, and I think we're in a yeah like and I think there's also gonna be some disconnect [[01:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld3gFs4E69E&t=4634.02s)]
*  We're okay letting poor people struggle here because I think on the back of our heads were like, yo [[01:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld3gFs4E69E&t=4639.76s)]
*  We need more 30 for 30s [[01:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld3gFs4E69E&t=4645.1s)]
*  To be honest with you, yo Europe got the trashes 30 for 30s, bro [[01:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld3gFs4E69E&t=4648.12s)]
*  They should have had way better ones, but they don't their 30 for 30s was like Christopher Columbus. Yeah [[01:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld3gFs4E69E&t=4652.72s)]

*  Theo and Dustin or salty in Israel [[01:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld3gFs4E69E&t=4795.099999999999s)]
*  I'll beat that baby's ass. I'll say this dude and no offense man. Beautiful child, bro [[01:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld3gFs4E69E&t=4803.58s)]

*  We can really spot [[01:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld3gFs4E69E&t=4823.58s)]
*  Fighters dude of all the fucking guys out there who look like they've been attacked by fucking dogs [[01:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld3gFs4E69E&t=4826.54s)]
*  And we pick some fucking kings. That's a great-ass point, man [[01:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld3gFs4E69E&t=4832.5s)]
*  Good point man. Yeah, I don't know that one. I mean it's tough [[01:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld3gFs4E69E&t=4838.3s)]
*  that was tough man because [[01:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld3gFs4E69E&t=4842.22s)]
*  You know deals got deals got his superpowers, but like if you go full rat King [[01:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld3gFs4E69E&t=4845.22s)]
*  It might be a short day of work [[01:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld3gFs4E69E&t=4850.3s)]
*  You know, I mean we got rabies baby. You might you might know me, you know, you might do something [[01:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld3gFs4E69E&t=4852.46s)]
*  I just don't know how to combat that at all [[01:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld3gFs4E69E&t=4857.26s)]
*  So you might take me out but then Izzy might have an advantage over Dustin just because of the size [[01:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld3gFs4E69E&t=4859.38s)]
*  Yeah, so it might it's tricky bro, it's a really tricky one man [[01:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld3gFs4E69E&t=4864.18s)]
*  Yeah, I think when you get into those type of guys and there the size is big [[01:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld3gFs4E69E&t=4869.58s)]
*  I mean look at Izzy versus Blachovic, you know the size just when you don't think about the fact of somebody with ten [[01:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld3gFs4E69E&t=4875.14s)]
*  Laying on you. Yeah, it's a lot of extra weight on their feet. The fight was even [[01:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld3gFs4E69E&t=4880.780000000001s)]
*  Yeah, but the second he got him down is just nothing he could do and there's nothing you can do and it's like that's why [[01:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld3gFs4E69E&t=4885.700000000001s)]
*  They have the weight divisions there, you know, but uh, but kudos [[01:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld3gFs4E69E&t=4890.84s)]
*  I mean look that's where in boxing you can get away with weight division stuff a little bit more because you can be tactical [[01:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld3gFs4E69E&t=4894.34s)]
*  You don't got to hurt the guy. You might not be able to hurt the guy in a higher weight class [[01:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld3gFs4E69E&t=4900.28s)]
*  But you can out box them. But when it comes to MMA [[01:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld3gFs4E69E&t=4903.24s)]
*  Those the weight when you're laying on top of someone. Yeah, there's only so much you could just lift off of you, right? [[01:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld3gFs4E69E&t=4906.400000000001s)]
*  You know and especially when it gets strategic like, you know when people are strategically placing their weight. Yeah [[01:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld3gFs4E69E&t=4913.28s)]
*  Big man and especially if you're new to having that weight, you know, yeah, but um, what do you think about Dustin fighting? [[01:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld3gFs4E69E&t=4919.900000000001s)]
*  Connor again, it looks like that's gonna happen. Yeah, it doesn't happen. I think it's a smart fight for Dustin man [[01:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld3gFs4E69E&t=4926.620000000001s)]
*  I mean, obviously, you know, it's a smart fight for him. I hope that the fight happens. That's what I start to worry [[01:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld3gFs4E69E&t=4932.120000000001s)]
*  I start to uh, I mean Dustin just worked so hard [[01:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld3gFs4E69E&t=4936.9400000000005s)]
*  he just deserves to have the rewards that he wants and I think he's starting to kind of like [[01:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld3gFs4E69E&t=4940.9400000000005s)]
*  It's interesting once you get to certain points in your career you start to see some rewards [[01:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld3gFs4E69E&t=4946.34s)]
*  What matters and also what some rewards matter to you at certain times? [[01:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld3gFs4E69E&t=4951.7s)]
*  I think I know where you're going with this but go, you know, I think sometimes you're like, okay [[01:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld3gFs4E69E&t=4955.18s)]
*  Like when you're younger, you know, I need the belt. I need the belt. I want the trophy. I deserve to be [[01:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld3gFs4E69E&t=4959.22s)]
*  Recognized we want recognition and then once I think you also get enough recognition and you get to a point where you see [[01:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld3gFs4E69E&t=4965.58s)]
*  Okay, I also want to be rewarded and be able to take care of myself and my family and so I think it's it's um [[01:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld3gFs4E69E&t=4971.82s)]
*  And and in the end you start to realize everything's kind of a business. It's also [[01:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld3gFs4E69E&t=4978.54s)]
*  It's kind of the it's we get romance by that belt, bro, and I've always been I'm a helpless romantic [[01:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld3gFs4E69E&t=4983.54s)]
*  You know always it's one thing I never liked about sometimes about like going to Hollywood is you see behind the curtain? [[01:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld3gFs4E69E&t=4989.54s)]
*  like I loved in the heat of the night because it was like [[01:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld3gFs4E69E&t=4995.34s)]
*  It was a TV show about like this community and it was real to me man [[01:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld3gFs4E69E&t=4998.820000000001s)]
*  And Carol O'Connor was like the sheriff and he like cared about the he cared about the convicts and about and there was like [[01:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld3gFs4E69E&t=5003.34s)]
*  Race stuff going on but everybody was trying their bed [[01:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld3gFs4E69E&t=5009.1s)]
*  Just like it felt like a but then you get there and I drive across my neighborhood and Carol O'Connor is fucking buried right there [[01:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld3gFs4E69E&t=5011.46s)]
*  and his son apparently was doing heroin down the street is just like you know what I'm saying the [[01:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld3gFs4E69E&t=5018.06s)]
*  The curtain goes away and you start to see that things a lot of things that we built [[01:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld3gFs4E69E&t=5023.06s)]
*  Even the magic of things is a business [[01:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld3gFs4E69E&t=5027.139999999999s)]
*  So I think in some of it you just keep the magic alive for yourself [[01:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld3gFs4E69E&t=5029.74s)]
*  You have to keep that alive in your heart and I start to then wonder who could keep that magic alive in their heart better [[01:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld3gFs4E69E&t=5032.86s)]
*  At this point in their careers out of Dustin and Connor and I believe that Dustin can do it better [[01:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld3gFs4E69E&t=5038.58s)]
*  Because uh [[01:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld3gFs4E69E&t=5047.219999999999s)]
*  Connor I mean dude, you gotta think fuck I gotta get up and fucking sell liquor in it in two hours. I think he's done. I [[01:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld3gFs4E69E&t=5049.0199999999995s)]
*  Don't know if he fights again [[01:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld3gFs4E69E&t=5055.14s)]
*  I I think that would be the only inhibitor to a third fight is Connor willing to do it [[01:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld3gFs4E69E&t=5056.66s)]
*  Because I don't know. I mean Dustin I thought beat him pretty easy. I [[01:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld3gFs4E69E&t=5063.46s)]
*  thought it was pretty easy and I think that it's an easy fight for Dustin again and [[01:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld3gFs4E69E&t=5068.18s)]
*  I [[01:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld3gFs4E69E&t=5073.18s)]
*  Don't think I don't know. I and listen. I don't think Connor has carried [[01:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld3gFs4E69E&t=5074.78s)]
*  his power [[01:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld3gFs4E69E&t=5079.82s)]
*  Through the higher weight divisions like when he was at 145, oh it was lights out then [[01:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld3gFs4E69E&t=5081.9s)]
*  155 it was like I need a hit you a few times. Okay, man, we shut the lights out [[01:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld3gFs4E69E&t=5088.259999999999s)]
*  Just wiggle a bit and then then I'll go [[01:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld3gFs4E69E&t=5096.259999999999s)]
*  It's more that weird Denver switch thing. You're like, how do you get this even goes all the way? [[01:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld3gFs4E69E&t=5099.259999999999s)]
*  So I [[01:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld3gFs4E69E&t=5106.299999999999s)]
*  But again, like you said like he's worth hundreds of millions of dollars [[01:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld3gFs4E69E&t=5107.54s)]
*  The only reason he would do it I think would be for more money and yeah go get your money [[01:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld3gFs4E69E&t=5111.06s)]
*  I want these guys to make all the fucking money. I'm just happy that [[01:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld3gFs4E69E&t=5115.34s)]
*  It looks as if I don't know him, but it looks as if Dustin went [[01:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld3gFs4E69E&t=5118.86s)]
*  What does that belt really mean? [[01:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld3gFs4E69E&t=5123.3s)]
*  Like does the belt define me as a human being no, it's like a cool trinket to have in my career [[01:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld3gFs4E69E&t=5125.7s)]
*  But you know, it'd be really cool [[01:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld3gFs4E69E&t=5130.66s)]
*  If I was defined by like being able to take care of generations of my family [[01:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld3gFs4E69E&t=5132.98s)]
*  By doing this mega fight and making tens of millions of dollars [[01:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld3gFs4E69E&t=5137.54s)]
*  That would be a cool way to be defined by going like the poor yeas [[01:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld3gFs4E69E&t=5140.82s)]
*  That are my kids and their kids and their kids are all going to nice private schools [[01:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld3gFs4E69E&t=5144.82s)]
*  And our community is gonna be helped out in his foundation is good [[01:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld3gFs4E69E&t=5149.0199999999995s)]
*  Like that is way better than a belt now [[01:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld3gFs4E69E&t=5151.9s)]
*  He could be Connor then go fight the winner of the title fight that is like Chandler verse Ola Vera [[01:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld3gFs4E69E&t=5154.18s)]
*  I think they're funny. Yeah, and and then he gets the belt awesome, but secure the bag [[01:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld3gFs4E69E&t=5159.88s)]
*  Like secure the fucking bag I hope that that is what I want all these guys to make all this a brutal way to make [[01:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld3gFs4E69E&t=5164.58s)]
*  A living. Yeah, I want you all to make all the fucking money [[01:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld3gFs4E69E&t=5170.62s)]
*  That's what that's what I think too. I and I bet honestly a little bit [[01:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld3gFs4E69E&t=5173.94s)]
*  I bet it was a little bit of a tough decision for Dustin because he still wants that he had where right him and [[01:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld3gFs4E69E&t=5177.86s)]
*  him and [[01:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld3gFs4E69E&t=5184.58s)]
*  Tony Ferguson were gonna fight and they didn't reward though. It just wasn't [[01:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld3gFs4E69E&t=5185.9s)]
*  They didn't feel like they got were being rewarded fair like he tries to do you know [[01:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld3gFs4E69E&t=5190.5s)]
*  He tries to be as fair and treat people as fair, you know [[01:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld3gFs4E69E&t=5194.299999999999s)]
*  So I bet it was a little fucking tough for him [[01:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld3gFs4E69E&t=5197.179999999999s)]
*  But yeah, but I think as you get further along look dude [[01:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld3gFs4E69E&t=5200.139999999999s)]
*  Yeah, like you said just let them fight for the belt though the poor I agree [[01:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld3gFs4E69E&t=5204.66s)]
*  Just let them fight for the fucking belt Dana like who I agree you make it a title fight [[01:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld3gFs4E69E&t=5207.98s)]
*  You put in a fucking Dallas Cowboys Stadium like who cares? It's the first event that we get to see live like [[01:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld3gFs4E69E&t=5211.9s)]
*  Yeah, I don't know why they didn't do that look but you're right though the poor EAs will be the rich EAs and that [[01:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld3gFs4E69E&t=5219.16s)]
*  Older you get you start to realize it's not about being rich [[01:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld3gFs4E69E&t=5228.5199999999995s)]
*  But it's about being able to fucking like yes wide [[01:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld3gFs4E69E&t=5231.5s)]
*  Being able to provide for yourself and your family is a very comforting feeling because as you get older [[01:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld3gFs4E69E&t=5234.0s)]
