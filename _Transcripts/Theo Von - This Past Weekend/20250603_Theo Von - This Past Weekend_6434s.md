*  I've got some tour dates to tell you about. I'll be in Cedar Rapids, St. Paul, Minnesota, Fargo, North Dakota, Rapid City, South Dakota, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Rochester, New York, and Detroit, Michigan, all in June and July. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=0.0s)]
*  Tickets available now at theovon.com. Thank you so much for your support. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=16.0s)]
*  Today's guest is a content creator, a restaurateur, and a comedian. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=23.0s)]
*  He is from Malaysia, and he found his way to the UK and America by doing comedy. He's known for his character Uncle Raja. Uncle Raja! [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=29.0s)]
*  A grumpy food critic who roasts celebrity chefs, and with that he's gained more than 30 million followers. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=40.0s)]
*  Quite the ride with today's guest. I couldn't be more geeked to get to hang out with Nigel Ung. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=47.0s)]
*  What's the most vain Asians you think? Because Asians, you don't think of, because people think about Asians a lot, right? [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=70.0s)]
*  Yeah, do they? Do they think about Asians a lot? Oh yeah. Yeah, okay, okay. Yeah, why? Why would you think about this? [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=82.0s)]
*  Because I think it's fascinating. Okay, right. Because people can't, some people can't believe it. They see it, they, you show somebody, like you show a baby, an Asian or whatever, it's just like, [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=89.0s)]
*  I think they'd be surprised. No, they look the same. Smaller eyes, squintier eyes, that's it. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=99.0s)]
*  Oh, that's a good point. I guess if you have a tall baby, yeah. Yeah, we have a little squintier, little flatter nose. That's it really, we're all the same, man. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=106.0s)]
*  Yeah, some of us can look whiter than you. Some of us can be fairer than white people. Oh yeah, that's a good point, huh? Yeah. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=116.0s)]
*  Yeah, I think we should have some white privilege. Yeah, that's a fair point. I'm whiter than you. That's a good point. Look at this shit, yeah. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=122.0s)]
*  Look at this honky. Look at this freaking sesame cracker. Oh, thank you. That's ridiculous. Thanks for inviting me on here, Theo. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=131.0s)]
*  Dude, it's a pleasure, man. Thank you so much. But no, what a, Nigel, Nigel? Nigel, Nigel Ung. Yes. And how do you say the last name? Ung. Ung. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=139.0s)]
*  Ung. Ung. It's a Southeast Asian, Malaysian last name. That's where I'm from originally. Yeah, that's a living, you got a, you're the damn living in word right there. I can't even. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=149.0s)]
*  I know. It's dangerous, isn't it? It's dangerous. Yeah. Yeah. It is. Yeah. There's a few letters away. It's risky, brother. There's an N-I-G. There's no A in there, thankfully. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=158.0s)]
*  Yeah, but if there's enough there, I think we're, like, people would be like, what's going on here? Yeah, there's that Vietnamese, there's that meme of the Vietnamese restaurant. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=169.0s)]
*  The name of the restaurant is B-I-C-H-N-G-A. Oh, oh. Just pronouncing, just ordering food, huh? Yeah, just call it the Vietnamese. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=179.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's one where there's a black guy narrating over it and saying, you can't tell me this is not bitch. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=190.0s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Wow, brother. That's what I'm saying, man. We try, man. We try. But I also like it's cafe, bitch. All of the ribs. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=198.0s)]
*  So this is a popular sound in, and you said you're from Malaysia? Yeah, yeah. That's not, in Vietnam, it would be N-G something. Okay. N-G-A, N-G-U-Y-E-N, Nguyen, right? But in Malaysia, Singapore, and Hong Kong, you will see N-G. N-G. Yeah. Yeah. It's confusing. No. Nguyen. Yeah. Yeah. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=210.0s)]
*  Yeah, I went to Malaysia one time when I was a student. Oh shit, really? Yeah, we went to, what's the capital? Kuala Lumpur. Kuala Lumpur. Yeah. For what? I just was a student on this thing called Semester at Sea. It's like a floating school. Uh huh. And one of the stops was over there in Malaysia. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=232.0s)]
*  So you took a boat, like a boat over there. Like a cruise ship. It's like a, like a, like a, pull it up. That's a long trip, man. Oh, is that a long trip? We left out of Vancouver, Canada. Yeah. That's how I got here. From the same boat, I think. Oh, really? [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=246.0s)]
*  Yeah, I just crawled onto your, you know, your boat without a visa. Oh, yeah. Welcome. That's how most people are getting in, dude. That's called the... Semester at Sea. We are not the best tourist destination, though. Malaysia. You know, we're like a little, tiny little country. We live well there. The quality of life is pretty good, but we're not like a big tourist place. Yeah, I think it felt like that. I think it felt like the beaches and then kind of what do we do here a little bit. Yeah, there's nothing to do there. You just eat and live, live your life. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=261.0s)]
*  But are, but are, so I don't forget this, are Malaysians the most vain? Who's the most vain? Koreans, man. Is it? Yeah, like Korean Koreans. Not Bobby Lee Korean. You know, Bobby Lee's, I think I was born here, right? Bobby Lee? Yeah. There's undeniable that guy does not have a birth certificate. That's legitimate. You know what I'm saying? Yeah. He probably, he's obviously a POW, you know? Yeah. He has very POW energy. That's true. And he has a lot of trauma, I think. Yeah, he has a lot of burn marks on his back, too. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=290.0s)]
*  Oh really? Yeah, from cigarettes, I think from gambling issues, but people say different things, you know? Yeah, but I think Koreans are the vainest Asians, man. They have a whole skincare. They're known for skincare. The whole country is known for skincare and plastic surgery. Oh really? Yeah. Bring up some of that Asian skincare. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=320.0s)]
*  There's lots of stuff, man. They put snail, that snail juice, you know, and a snail crawls. It leaves behind like a trail of goo. Yeah. They put that shit on their skin. No way. Look at, look at, look at that woman. She's like glowing. Look at that. Oh, they got some poor clamp Asians over there. Yeah, that's why I think they already, some people look dead already because they just are preserved. Yeah, preserved well. Bring up that snail juice thing. I want to see that. Can we get something about that? You have to Google snail juice. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=336.0s)]
*  Snail mucin. M-U-C-I-N. Yeah, that's why I have a, I have a joke about this that I do in my act that it's hard to find Asian pedophiles because, you know, they all look like they're 12, but they're actually 35. Why would you take the risk on an illegal one? [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=366.0s)]
*  Oh yeah. You'll find you're just molesting yourself. Yeah, just molesting your people and then you're like, oh shit, they look 16. Advanced. Yeah, that, that kind of thing. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=383.0s)]
*  Advanced snail 96 mucin power essence. Lightweight essence, which absorbs into the skin fast to give skin a natural glow from the inside. This essence is created from nutritious, low stimulation, filtered snail mucin to keep your skin moisturized and illuminated all day. Wow. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=392.0s)]
*  It's good marketing, marketing writing, right? Yeah. I don't know how, how real it is. How do you know it's actually snail mucin? Yeah. You know, it could just be water and sugar and cornstarch. Oh yeah. They could have anything in there. They don't do that kind of shit. I think that's, yeah. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=410.0s)]
*  That's very Asian right there. No, it's a white woman doing it. Yeah, but we learned it from you guys. I mean that is cheekbone sashimi. That's true. That's true. We bring a lot to the world. Oh, that's so wild. So that's a real thing that people are buying this. And how much does it go for? Give me how much for a quart of it? Oh, CVS has it. No, go get some later. 24.99. 24.99 for oh, for seven and a half ounces. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=427.0s)]
*  Yeah, you don't need it. You have good skin, man. I'm okay. But you know, everybody wants to do a little bit more. But how do you even farm it out of them? Do you follow right behind them with a little scooper? I don't know, man. Maybe they just have a whole cage full of snails and oh, and maybe it's like a floor. And it just drips down into a bucket or something. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=457.0s)]
*  I haven't thought of this. Forcing snail to release mucin through harsh treatment like dunking them in salt water. No way. That's very mean. This was probably taught by a lot of the forces in Vietnam. Some of this is illegal. Go back to it. This is considered waterboarding. I think snail mucin, a popular skincare ingredient, is collected from live snails through various methods, some more humane than others. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=474.0s)]
*  Traditional methods involve forcing snails to release mucin through harsh treatment like dunking them in salt water or chemicals. It's like killing a whole family just so someone can have like smoother skin. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=503.0s)]
*  Many companies now use methods like gentle stimulation or allowing snails to naturally excrete mucin on mesh nets, ensuring their well-being. Wow. What's gentle stimulation for a snail? You know, I think just a little little fingering action on just petting, petting, heavy petting. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=515.0s)]
*  Heavy petting, maybe listening to some, what's a popular Malaysian love musician or band? We don't really have that. You can use an American musician. I'll probably use Marvin Gaye, I guess. You can play some Marvin Gaye. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=533.0s)]
*  Some Malarvin Gaye. Is that fair? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. If we had some Malarvin Gaye and we played that, that would be beautiful. Let's get it on. And you just touching that snail's back. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=549.0s)]
*  Yeah. A few snails, not just one. Yeah, that's true. Yeah. You can't just four play with one snail. Yeah, that's weird. They move too slow. Yeah. Yeah. You got to get a little back. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=563.0s)]
*  It's like, you know how that chess movie where the one person is playing against 10 chess masters, whereas you against 10 snails just. Oh yeah. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=574.0s)]
*  You just play. It's almost like one of those. It's like that thing where those things are dropping and you're catching them, you know? Yeah. Yeah. I like it. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=581.0s)]
*  I like it. Naigle, good to see you, man. Good to see you too, man. Thank you for all of the entertainment, man. You definitely. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=587.0s)]
*  I make too many videos, man. That's the life of a YouTube person, you know? It is, huh? Yeah. I got my start. I started doing stand-up 2010, 2011. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=593.0s)]
*  You had a special that came out a few years ago, right? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I did. It's released on a Moment House. Yeah. Have you used that platform before? You just sell tickets, people buy it and they watch it. Yeah. But I'm going to whack it on my YouTube eventually. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=603.0s)]
*  Moment House? Yeah. Yeah. Is it live performance on Moment House or is it you just tape it, put it up and then there's a premiere? Yeah. Yeah. Something like that. I think Andrew Schultz did it here. Oh, yeah. That kind of thing. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=614.0s)]
*  And you started to, were you born in Malaysia? Yeah. Yeah. I was born in Malaysia and then I went to live there for 20 years of my life. Then I went to university. I went to Northwestern in Illinois near Chicago. Oh yeah. Yeah. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=626.0s)]
*  And then I moved to the UK for a few years, for eight years. Then I'm back here in LA. What are Malaysian, because I don't know a ton about the Malay, right? Yeah. Yeah. Me neither, really. You don't? You know, you have so many different races there, you know? In Malaysia? Yeah. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=637.0s)]
*  Yeah. There's Chinese Malaysian, which I'm that. Malay Malaysians and Indian Malaysians. And we don't really make, so pretty segregated, you know? Really? Yeah. So there's beef between what type of Malaysian you are? There's no beef. We just don't really care as much if you're not part of the group. Oh, I see. But it's very peaceful. It's very peaceful. Yeah. Yeah. So it's not violent, but it's still like, you just kind of stick with your tribe. Yeah. Yeah. We try to venture out, but you know, sometimes it's hard to eat different things and there are limitations to what Malaysians eat. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=653.0s)]
*  Yeah. So, yeah, so there's a lot of things that Malaysians can eat, you know? Oh, Malaysians can't eat everything? Yeah. Well, Malay Malaysians are Muslim. There's Malay Malay. They're Muslim? Yeah. So they can't eat pork, right? And also in Malaysia, certain restaurants need to be halal certified for Malay people to eat it. If a Malay person is caught eating at a non-halal restaurant, depending on where you are, it could be, you know, you could get into trouble, basically. Yeah. So there's those little things, but we overall are pretty peaceful and we like each other. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=683.0s)]
*  You like each other, but every time there's a little bit of Mongolian beef with each other. Yeah. I feel that. I've had that. Yeah. Yeah. It's okay. It's okay. It's bad. American Chinese shit. It's travesty. It's something you just, it's something you fill your jaw with while you look at through Target. It's nice at an airport, you know, you get an airport Panda Express, you know, it's the best thing there. Yeah, it's good, but it's a lot of sugar though. Yeah. Sugar is good. But sugar, yeah. You like sugar. Come on. I like it, but I just know it doesn't, I know it's secretly plotting against me. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=713.0s)]
*  That's what I feel like. Really? Sugar is plotting against you? Well, I feel like it gets in your system and it knows it's going to win. Cause it's like a deteriorate. It deteriorates you. Yeah. Well, most things do though. Most things that taste good are deteriorates, you know, cholesterol, fats, butter, olive oil. Yeah. Yeah. Even vagina. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That it takes, it ruins your time really. Just chasing vagina all the time. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=743.0s)]
*  I'm glad I'm out of that phase of my life now. Yeah. That's what I heard to her that you got married. You're married a couple of years now. Well, I'm, I'm engaged a couple of years now, but I'm getting married in July. Oh, you're getting married in July. Yeah. Oh, way. And so is this a traditional Malaysian wedding? No, no, we're doing it in Europe. My, my fiance is American. She's from Miami. Well, South Florida. Okay. You know, and we, was it scary for you to choose a fiance? Had you, how, how had dating been like for you in your life? Well, I've been married before. Yeah. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=773.0s)]
*  Married young, divorced young. Do you have to- I recommend that. Get that out the way. You know, that's, that's, that's my fiance. You know. YouTube's uncle Roger shares photos from engagement shoot with fiance Sabrina. Oh, beautiful couple. Yeah. She's cute. I think I did well. You know, so I got her out. I lock it in, you know, can't do any better than that. That's when men lock it in. They're like, this is it. Yep. She's nice. She's hot. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=803.0s)]
*  She's smart. All right. Let's do it. Way better than the previous one, you know? Oh, really? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. No, the previous one, she was fine. But if you just end up, grew apart, you know. It didn't fit. Well, I was, I was really doing standup hardcore at the time and it just takes a toll on your relationships. Oh yeah. You can't have a rel- if you're doing standup, I think it's impossible, you know, because also the hours that you're out, it's very like, um. And I had a day job too. So I was like nine to five at the day job. Then I was doing this all this in the UK. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=833.0s)]
*  So after, after my day job finishes, I'll just take a long train up to Birmingham or something, the middle of the UK from London, two hour train, do my set, come back, arrive home at one. All I see her is sleeping. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=863.0s)]
*  He just sees me sleeping. I see her sleeping. And then seven years later, Hey, we're not the same person anymore. Okay. Who would have guessed? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. We're awake. Yeah. And I don't like you when we're awake. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=874.32s)]
*  That's an issue with a lot of marriages. I think. Yeah. Yeah. Marriages. Go to bed. Yeah. I like you more when you're unconscious. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=885.4s)]
*  In Malaysia, is it popular? And sorry, because we've never had a Malaysian guest. You should get Ronnie Chang next. Oh, what's that? I messaged about it. He's so funny. I got, we got to do it. He's Malaysian? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=895.3199999999999s)]
*  So some people keeping secret then, but because I didn't know that. Yeah. But I would love to see, um, is it in Malaysia? I just want to learn about a little bit of the tradition of the place. Okay. So do you have to, is it arranged marriage or what is dating like? [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=909.28s)]
*  No, it's not arranged at all. Yeah. You got to find someone. We got incels there too. You know, arrange marriages would be a great solution to the incel problem. Wouldn't it? And when incels you say, what do you mean? People incels, you know, the gamers or whatever. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=924.4s)]
*  They can be incels. Some of them, you know, there's a whole movement, isn't there? The Reddit people, the blue pill, red pill, black pill, something pill, the incels who they can't get laid and then they start hating on women. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=936.56s)]
*  That kind of thing. Yeah. Yeah. But no, no, in Malaysia, it's all, it's not arranged. You have to arrange it for yourself. Yeah. Their gamertag is like these whores are ruining everything. 6,000 or whatever. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=948.72s)]

*  Where romance meets finance. Oh, definitely. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=1027.2s)]
*  I mean, what about $40 a week? [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=1029.72s)]
*  It goes far, man. It goes the money. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=1033.68s)]

*  Dude, what if our podcast, we sponsored a couple of sugar... [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=1037.96s)]
*  We booked some sugar. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=1042.8s)]
*  Let's book some sugar. It's a deterrent, you know? [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=1044.0s)]
*  It's slowly clawing away at you. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=1046.6799999999998s)]
*  Oh, definitely. I can see it ruining a lot of things. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=1049.48s)]
*  How many episodes of a pod you put out a week is going to get the number way down, man. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=1052.48s)]
*  But what if we book some sugar, right? [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=1057.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=1059.48s)]
*  And we just support it and every now and then they just check in. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=1060.0s)]
*  But they don't have to do anything sexual. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=1062.48s)]
*  We have them maybe get a good hobby. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=1064.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=1066.48s)]

*  That would be nice. I'm sure they'll be down. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=1070.28s)]
*  This is safer than, you know, that [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=1072.28s)]
*  the OnlyFans model will fly to Dubai and they get shat on. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=1075.96s)]

*  Yeah. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=1084.96s)]
*  I think it's good. But I do... [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=1085.96s)]
*  I would love to look into, Nick, maybe the price of if we could sponsor a couple of good [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=1086.96s)]
*  women, sugar, sugar, sugar, sugary, sugar girls. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=1094.96s)]
*  I think a grand a month. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=1097.96s)]
*  Oh, that's a lot. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=1099.96s)]
*  Yeah, that's a lot. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=1100.96s)]
*  I mean, you said it goes far over there, dude. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=1101.96s)]
*  I'm talking 80, maybe 120. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=1104.64s)]
*  You would get a different quality of woman for 80. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=1106.64s)]
*  But that's okay. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=1108.64s)]
*  But would it be great to sponsor that lady? [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=1110.64s)]
*  Let her just say, hey, take the week off. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=1112.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=1114.64s)]
*  Go relax, go for a run or something. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=1115.64s)]
*  Okay. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=1117.64s)]
*  Yeah, that would be good. Sign up for something. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=1118.64s)]
*  That would be great. And we can support the infrastructure over there. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=1120.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=1122.64s)]
*  Is family big over there? Is that like a big thing? [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=1123.64s)]
*  What's it like there that you notice that's different between Malaysia and U.S. or UK culture? [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=1125.64s)]
*  I think it's really the difference between Asia and the West, really. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=1132.3200000000002s)]
*  Family is big. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=1137.3200000000002s)]
*  People live with their parents and it's socially acceptable to do that. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=1138.3200000000002s)]
*  Right. [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=1141.3200000000002s)]
*  And then when the parents get old, we don't really send them to homes. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=1142.3200000000002s)]
*  You know, we bring them into our own home instead of sending them to a nursing home. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=1145.3200000000002s)]
*  That's better, huh? [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=1150.3200000000002s)]
*  That's nice, I think. [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=1151.3200000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=1152.3200000000002s)]
*  But what I like about the West is everybody is so confident and they have an opinion and [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=1153.3200000000002s)]
*  they're not afraid to express it. [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=1158.92s)]
*  Sometimes in Asia, because we are taught a little bit more just obey, obey, obey, you [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=1161.2s)]
*  don't really have that confidence and assertiveness. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=1166.2s)]
*  And sometimes that doesn't work well here. [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=1169.2s)]
*  If you're an Asian person in the West and you have a corporate job and you just keep [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=1171.2s)]
*  to yourself, you miss out on promotions because you're just not speaking enough and not bullshitting [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=1175.2s)]
*  enough, not building that social relationship enough. [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=1180.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=1183.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=1184.2s)]
*  And do Asian people want to say more? [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=1185.2s)]
*  Like, do they have a feeling inside of them where like, I want to speak up, but I don't [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=1186.2s)]
*  think it's appropriate or is it I'm afraid or it's just not part of their capability, [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=1190.64s)]
*  natural capability? [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=1197.5600000000002s)]
*  I think it's all those things. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=1198.8400000000001s)]
*  I think it's cultural is I'm afraid. [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=1200.3600000000001s)]
*  Why don't I just mind my own business? [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=1202.68s)]
*  You know, put your head down and work hard. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=1204.6000000000001s)]
*  Sometimes that doesn't work out well, you know, you can't just put your head down. [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=1207.18s)]
*  You got to put your head up and look at the world and talk some shit. [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=1209.8000000000002s)]
*  Oh, yeah, dude. [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=1213.96s)]
*  That's what stand up is, right? [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=1214.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=1216.4s)]
*  Oh, you have your head down for a half hour. [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=1217.4s)]
*  Somebody will start fucking you around here. [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=1218.52s)]
*  You know, it's a dangerous area. [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=1220.52s)]
*  Have your head down. [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=1222.52s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=1223.52s)]
*  Some frickin Narcan monkey will start frickin jacking you from the back over there. [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=1224.52s)]
*  So it's definitely you got to have your head up. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=1229.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=1232.44s)]
*  Is there something do you think that Americans could do to better support Asian people like [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=1233.44s)]
*  to like, like ask more? [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=1238.24s)]
*  Like, is there something like, you know what I'm saying? [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=1240.2800000000002s)]
*  Like, because sometimes there's never this communication about how culture should interact [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=1242.0400000000002s)]
*  and we're all just left to figure it out. [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=1245.52s)]
*  You ask me like I'm the leader of all the Asians. [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=1247.28s)]
*  But you came. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=1250.28s)]

*  Just wipe your phone, you know, wipe your phone before you come. [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=1261.48s)]
*  What can you do? [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=1266.76s)]
*  Honestly, I enjoy living in LA because I feel like the Asian food here is probably some [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=1267.76s)]
*  of the best in the world. [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=1272.88s)]
*  Maybe New York is better. [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=1273.88s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=1275.08s)]

*  And there's Koreatown, a 10 minute drive from me, then Little Tokyo. [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=1281.6s)]
*  You just I like that. [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=1285.04s)]
*  Just don't fuck with us. [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=1286.8799999999999s)]
*  Let us do our thing. [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=1287.8799999999999s)]

*  Yeah, it's a lot of good stuff. [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=1295.24s)]
*  It's not like when I do the La Factory, they just don't let me on because I'm Asian. [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=1296.24s)]
*  So I feel like I get the no, no, no, they don't do. [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=1300.04s)]
*  I get the same opportunities, I think. [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=1302.96s)]
*  It's so unorganized over there. [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=1304.82s)]
*  It seems like I hate to say that, but everybody's been saying it. [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=1306.54s)]
*  But they've been good to me. [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=1310.5s)]
*  You know, they've been good to you. [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=1311.5s)]
*  I like the audiences there because it's like you get such a tourist crowd, right? [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=1312.5s)]
*  So I feel like I'm playing to all of America, you know, West Coast, East Coast, middle, [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=1316.4199999999998s)]
*  everywhere, the South. [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=1322.5s)]
*  And I think if a joke works there, you know, you can take it on the road with you. [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=1324.1399999999999s)]
*  Yeah, it's a good point. [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=1327.9399999999998s)]
*  I think one thing that makes it tough in there is the lighting, the way the lighting, like [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=1328.9399999999998s)]
*  the whole room is kind of lit up. [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=1331.78s)]
*  So I think it creates an ambiance there sometimes where the audience is more involved in the [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=1334.22s)]
*  show. [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=1339.1s)]
*  That's true. [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=1340.1s)]
*  You can see everyone. [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=1341.1s)]
*  Right. [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=1342.1s)]
*  And then they feel like they're supposed to be involved because they're kind of not protected [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=1343.1s)]
*  from the, you know, because usually the audience is kind of in the dark. [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=1344.82s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, I see that. [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=1348.02s)]
*  And so Asian families, Malaysian families, a lot of times you'll live at home. [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=1350.6s)]
*  Yeah, it's common. [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=1354.86s)]
*  More common than here. [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=1356.18s)]
*  That's cool, man. [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=1357.5s)]
*  And right now in LA, hopefully, you know, if things go well, I can buy a slightly bigger [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=1358.5s)]
*  house with an ADU, then fly my mom over, you know, let her stay with us for a few months. [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=1362.82s)]
*  Oh, like an ADU is like what? [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=1368.1399999999999s)]
*  Additional dwelling unit. [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=1370.4199999999998s)]
*  OK. [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=1371.4199999999998s)]
*  So like a separate guest house. [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=1372.4199999999998s)]
*  Like a casita or something. [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=1373.86s)]
*  A casita. [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=1374.86s)]
*  Yeah, the accessory dwelling unit. [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=1375.86s)]
*  Accessory dwelling unit. [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=1377.86s)]
*  Secondary residential dwelling unit located on the same lot as a primary residence. [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=1378.86s)]
*  And so essentially a smaller separate living space. [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=1383.26s)]
*  So a smaller house for the mom and the mother-in-law with their own kitchen because Asian cooking [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=1385.5s)]
*  can stink up a house. [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=1391.6599999999999s)]
*  It's delicious, but during the cooking process, it smells. [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=1393.3s)]
*  It's bad. [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=1396.34s)]
*  It's bad. [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=1397.34s)]
*  It smells bad, but it tastes good. [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=1398.34s)]
*  Why? [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=1399.7399999999998s)]
*  What are some of the... [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=1400.7399999999998s)]
*  Is it because it's a lot of, I'm guessing, fish maybe or... [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=1401.7399999999998s)]
*  Shrimp paste. [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=1403.58s)]
*  Oh, God. [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=1404.58s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=1405.58s)]
*  And then pepper paste. [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=1406.58s)]
*  A lot of pork. [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=1407.58s)]
*  You know how you cook bacon, the whole house smells like bacon. [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=1408.58s)]
*  A lot of pork, a lot of garlic, shrimp paste, you know, sometimes fermented shrimp paste. [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=1410.58s)]
*  Fish sauces. [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=1416.2199999999998s)]
*  But why? [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=1417.2199999999998s)]
*  But why? [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=1418.2199999999998s)]
*  Why? [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=1419.2199999999998s)]
*  It tastes good, man. [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=1420.2199999999998s)]
*  It tastes good. [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=1421.82s)]
*  It adds a different sort of flavor. [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=1422.82s)]
*  It adds this thing called umami to your food. [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=1423.82s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=1426.02s)]
*  Try it. [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=1427.02s)]
*  Umami means what? [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=1428.02s)]
*  Umami is like, you know how the tongue can taste like four flavors, sweet, sour, salty, [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=1429.02s)]
*  and bitter? [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=1434.98s)]
*  Umami is like the fifth flavor. [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=1435.98s)]
*  It's a meaty savoriness. [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=1438.98s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=1440.98s)]
*  Umami is one of the five basic taste sensations along with a sweet, sour, salty, and bitter. [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=1441.98s)]
*  And is often described as a savory or meaty flavor. [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=1446.58s)]
*  Cheese has a lot of it, see? [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=1451.26s)]
*  Cheese. [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=1452.26s)]
*  So when you eat pizza, that's why it's so good, you know? [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=1453.26s)]
*  It is perceived through taste receptors that respond to compounds like glutamate, inocinate, [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=1455.86s)]
*  and guanilate, which are abundant in foods such as meat, cheese, tomatoes, and mushrooms. [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=1462.42s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=1469.42s)]
*  I'll bring you around to Asian restaurants. [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=1470.42s)]
*  Food is my thing, you know? [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=1472.42s)]
*  I do comedy about food now. [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=1473.9s)]
*  Oh, I know it. [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=1475.38s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=1476.38s)]
*  Oh yeah, I know. [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=1477.38s)]
*  I want to get into some of that. [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=1478.38s)]
*  I'm just trying to get a little bit more idea of Malaysia. [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=1480.0200000000002s)]
*  Just of what it feels like to be in Malaysia, because you don't hear a ton about it. [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=1483.0200000000002s)]
*  And the biggest thing you heard about probably is the plane that you guys lost. [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=1486.7s)]
*  Yeah, we still lost, man. [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=1490.0200000000002s)]
*  Is it really? [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=1491.6200000000001s)]
*  Still can't find it. [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=1492.6200000000001s)]
*  It's crazy. [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=1493.6200000000001s)]
*  What's the word over there? [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=1494.6200000000001s)]
*  Bring that up, Malaysian 370. [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=1495.6200000000001s)]
*  What's going on with it? [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=1497.14s)]
*  I think, and the most, I've gone into a rabbit hole about this. [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=1498.14s)]
*  Also Kathleen Madigan, she's a comic here, and she has the best bit. [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=1501.46s)]
*  If you want to get the best stand-up routine about Malaysian Airlines, go search Kathleen [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=1505.2s)]
*  Madigan, MH370. [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=1508.86s)]
*  But my theory is the pilot wanted to kill himself. [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=1510.86s)]
*  And so he just, because of the way the plane swerved, the path the plane took, it swerved [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=1516.8999999999999s)]
*  past his hometown first, before riding off into the Indian Ocean. [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=1523.3s)]
*  So he just swerved past his hometown, just take one last peak. [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=1527.5s)]
*  But by that point, all the passengers on the plane were already unconscious. [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=1531.4199999999998s)]
*  Really going through the pressure? [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=1536.3799999999999s)]
*  Yeah, he depressurized the plane, but then the cockpit, the pressure stays on for a [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=1537.5s)]
*  little bit longer. [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=1542.3400000000001s)]
*  So he was just taking one last peak at his hometown and then just driving off into the [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=1543.3400000000001s)]
*  sunset and ocean. [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=1546.8200000000002s)]
*  It's almost kind of... [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=1548.7s)]
*  It's romantic. [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=1549.7s)]
*  Don't give them any ideas, man. [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=1550.7s)]
*  United Airlines don't need to hear this. [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=1552.7s)]
*  I hate to say this, but it sounds a little bit romantic. [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=1554.3000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, let's play one clip right here. [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=1557.8600000000001s)]
*  What do we have? [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=1559.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=1560.5s)]
*  ...a disturbing reason for the plane's disappearance. [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=1561.5s)]
*  On and off search efforts have failed to locate the plane, which disappeared with 239 people [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=1565.06s)]
*  on board more than four years ago. [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=1570.78s)]
*  60 Minutes Australia brought together an international group of aviation experts who say that the [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=1573.1s)]
*  plane's pilot crashed the flight intentionally. [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=1578.58s)]
*  Joining me now to discuss the board is CBS News contributor and former chairman of the [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=1582.3s)]
*  National Transportation Safety Board. [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=1586.26s)]
*  He looks like he owns stock in that company. [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=1587.26s)]
*  For sure. [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=1588.58s)]
*  And it looks like he probably shorted the Malaysia Airlines. [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=1589.58s)]
*  He definitely is, dude. [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=1592.82s)]
*  First, the flight path that was reconstructed using military radar. [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=1595.58s)]
*  What was suspicious about that? [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=1599.4199999999998s)]
*  Well, the plan showed that he was going in and out of various countries between Thailand [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=1601.86s)]
*  and Malaysia. [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=1609.4199999999998s)]
*  One would have thought, based on that pattern, that someone would have sent up some military [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=1611.58s)]
*  aircraft to look at them. [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=1617.52s)]
*  According to the television experts, they said he did this on purpose to evade the military [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=1620.34s)]
*  radar. [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=1626.86s)]
*  Well, one of the experts... [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=1627.86s)]
*  It's kind of boring. [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=1629.86s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=1630.86s)]
*  What do you expect? [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=1631.86s)]
*  Yeah, what do you expect? [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=1632.86s)]
*  And it's like people like, it's like hide and go seek. [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=1633.86s)]
*  They never found the guy and people are just wondering where he is. [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=1636.54s)]
*  We find like a part of a wing every two years. [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=1639.02s)]
*  It's like a little fun little treasure hunt. [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=1641.9399999999998s)]
*  It comes up. [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=1644.9399999999998s)]
*  I keep track of this, man. [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=1645.9399999999998s)]
*  This is my true crime. [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=1647.3799999999999s)]
*  Oh, it is. [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=1648.9s)]
*  It's the only thing people know us for and I love it. [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=1649.9s)]
*  But also in a way, it's almost beautiful. [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=1652.86s)]
*  Like a place so like... [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=1654.6200000000001s)]
*  It almost makes it mystical in a way. [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=1657.24s)]
*  Malaysia. [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=1659.5s)]

*  Thanks. [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=1661.5s)]
*  You know, the biggest thing that when my fiance, when she traveled to Malaysia for the first [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=1662.5s)]
*  time, she's American, right? [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=1666.06s)]
*  So the biggest thing she noticed is she told me she's never seen Muslim people who look [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=1667.06s)]
*  Asian. [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=1672.02s)]
*  I would say that is the biggest, not culture shock, but the biggest observation you'll [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=1673.02s)]
*  get. [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=1677.22s)]

*  What was one of the biggest myths over the years about the Malaysian flight? [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=1902.22s)]
*  Was there something that was like, did people think it had gone to a certain place? [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=1905.22s)]
*  Or was it always just a missing plane? [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=1910.22s)]
*  I'm trying to... [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=1912.22s)]
*  I think there are lots of theories, right? [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=1913.22s)]
*  And some people say they just entered the Bermuda Triangle and they're all still alive. [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=1916.22s)]
*  But yeah, I think they're all dead. [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=1920.22s)]
*  He just drove the plane until he ran out of gas. [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=1922.22s)]
*  And it just sunk into the ocean. [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=1925.22s)]
*  Everybody was unconscious though. [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=1928.22s)]
*  So they didn't have that really scary moment, right? [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=1930.22s)]
*  I think it's like a less tragic situation than 9-11. [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=1933.22s)]
*  You know, 9-11, they were all conscious. [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=1937.22s)]
*  They knew they were flying into that building. [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=1939.22s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=1940.22s)]
*  Right? [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=1941.22s)]
*  And some people were probably trying to hurry up and get their luggage. [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=1942.22s)]
*  Because I hate it when people get up on a plane early before it lands, stops or whatever. [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=1944.22s)]
*  You think they're ruffling through the overhead storage? [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=1949.22s)]
*  Some hurried ass, some business asshole is like, I gotta get off first. [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=1952.22s)]
*  It's like, bitch, we're fucking... [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=1956.22s)]
*  Yeah, we're dead. [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=1958.22s)]
*  Yeah, it's just crazy. [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=1959.22s)]
*  But I hate it when people get up early before the plane is like at the gate, you know? [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=1960.22s)]
*  Yeah, and then the flight attendant has to tell you, please sit down. [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=1963.22s)]
*  The seatbelt light's still on. [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=1966.22s)]
*  Yeah, I know. [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=1968.22s)]
*  Do you fly a lot when you tour around the US? [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=1970.22s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=1972.22s)]
*  I'm just a bit... [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=1973.22s)]
*  My conception, my concept of US touring is a big ass tour bus with your face on the side of it. [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=1974.22s)]
*  Oh, no face. [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=1980.22s)]
*  No face? [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=1981.22s)]
*  No, I think that would be too ego. [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=1982.22s)]
*  I think I wouldn't let my face... [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=1984.22s)]
*  I don't want people to know, like, I don't want people coming and looking for me. [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=1985.22s)]
*  You know, you already have at night, they'll have some... [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=1989.22s)]
*  If you do a show in a town, sometimes we'll be in a tour bus. [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=1991.22s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=1994.22s)]
*  And see if you bring up... [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=1995.22s)]
*  You can put your face on a different bus. [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=1996.22s)]
*  Oh, that's a good idea. [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=1998.22s)]
*  You ride a nondescript bus. [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=1999.22s)]
*  You put your face on a different bus. [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2001.22s)]
*  Just like the LA City Transit bus. [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2003.22s)]
*  Just with your face, just riding around. [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2005.22s)]
*  It's just like a Greyhound bus, like going through Mississippi. [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2008.22s)]
*  It's like, follow us to the next show. [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2011.22s)]
*  And you get there and it's just a bunch of, like, people who just got out of prison. [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2013.22s)]
*  Like, getting off in Hammond, Louisiana. [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2017.22s)]
*  Oh, Joe Coy has his face on a bus. [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2020.22s)]
*  Joe Coy has his face on it. [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2021.22s)]
*  Have you had him on the pod? [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2023.22s)]
*  He's like the other leader of Asian people. [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2024.22s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2026.22s)]
*  We definitely have had him on. [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2027.22s)]
*  Joe Coy is a special guy. [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2028.22s)]
*  Special guy, Joe Coy. [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2029.22s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2030.22s)]
*  Joe Coy. [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2031.22s)]
*  Joseph. [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2032.22s)]
*  Joseph. [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2033.22s)]
*  Joseph. [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2034.22s)]
*  Good guy. [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2035.22s)]
*  There we are right there with the tour bus. [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2036.22s)]
*  Yeah, we do like... [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2037.22s)]
*  Oh, nice. [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2038.22s)]
*  Yeah, a lot of times it's just the tour bus. [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2039.22s)]
*  But nothing... [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2041.22s)]
*  Very under the radar. [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2042.22s)]
*  Nothing really crazy on the inside or outside. [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2043.22s)]
*  We run a pretty lean ship for the most part. [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2046.22s)]
*  Yeah, when I was on tour in the US, I just flew to every city. [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2049.2200000000003s)]
*  Did you? [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2052.2200000000003s)]
*  I didn't even go with an opener. [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2053.2200000000003s)]
*  On tour, I would open for myself. [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2054.22s)]
*  Uncle Roger was my opener. [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2056.22s)]
*  Oh, really? [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2057.22s)]
*  You know, so I save a bit of money that way. [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2058.22s)]
*  So Uncle Roger is your assumed character, kind of. [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2060.22s)]
*  It's like a... [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2062.22s)]
*  It's another character, but it's just you. [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2064.22s)]
*  Yeah, it's just me. [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2066.22s)]
*  I speak with a stronger accent and I'm a little bit grumpier. [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2067.22s)]
*  But you don't wear... [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2070.22s)]
*  You're not wearing a mustache or a cape or anything. [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2071.22s)]
*  I wear an orange polo. [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2073.22s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2074.22s)]
*  That's it. [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2075.22s)]
*  That's Uncle Roger. [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2076.22s)]
*  And it just took off because it came... [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2077.22s)]
*  You know, if you want to see some... [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2079.22s)]
*  Uncle Roger mostly complains about food, right? [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2080.22s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2082.22s)]
*  Mostly about Asian food, like fried rice and those things. [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2083.22s)]
*  And if you want to see someone complain about Asian food, [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2086.22s)]
*  it better be someone like extremely Asian, right? [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2089.22s)]
*  That adds the authenticity and the comedy of it. [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2092.22s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2094.22s)]
*  So that's why it took off the food stuff. [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2095.22s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2097.22s)]
*  But yeah, he's just me with an orange polo, stronger accent. [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2098.22s)]
*  You know, when I do Uncle Roger's portion in my tour, [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2100.22s)]
*  it's like my old material. [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2104.22s)]
*  I just let the character do it. [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2105.22s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2107.22s)]
*  People love it. [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2108.22s)]
*  That's me, yeah, with the orange polo. [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2109.22s)]
*  But you know, the bar for character comedy on YouTube is very low. [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2110.22s)]
*  Yeah, that's a good point. [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2114.22s)]
*  Just put a shirt. [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2116.22s)]
*  Just put a shirt. [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2117.22s)]
*  Holy shit, are they the same person? [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2118.22s)]
*  Adam Ray's Dr. Phil is higher effort than whatever this is. [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2124.22s)]
*  Yeah, dude. [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2128.22s)]
*  It just seemed like the very... [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2129.22s)]
*  The best guy at Home Depot, you know? [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2131.22s)]
*  Like a student. [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2133.22s)]
*  You look like a student at Home Depot. [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2134.22s)]
*  Oh, thank you. [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2136.22s)]
*  It's very great, man. [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2137.22s)]
*  Yeah, people love Uncle Roger [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2138.22s)]
*  and people love learning about different food through him. [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2139.22s)]
*  I think that's one thing. [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2142.22s)]
*  Did you... [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2143.22s)]
*  In Malaysia, I noticed when I was there, there's a big monkey issue, right? [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2144.22s)]
*  It's a big monkey. [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2147.22s)]
*  It depends where you go. [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2148.22s)]
*  In the city, that's fine. [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2149.22s)]
*  You probably went to this place called Batu Caves. [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2151.22s)]
*  It's like a cave, a Hindu cave. [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2153.22s)]
*  And then when you walk up the steps, [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2155.22s)]
*  there are monkeys who just steal food from you. [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2157.22s)]
*  Right. [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2159.22s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2160.22s)]
*  That sounds like a monkey issue. [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2161.22s)]
*  So what I'm saying is, do y'all eat... [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2162.22s)]
*  Have you ever had monkeys? [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2166.22s)]
*  No, no, no. [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2168.22s)]
*  I know some Asians do. [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2169.22s)]
*  Really? [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2171.22s)]
*  You know? [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2172.22s)]
*  I think maybe China's... [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2173.22s)]
*  I've heard, and I don't know how true this is, [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2174.22s)]
*  but in some places... [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2176.22s)]
*  I believe it too, man. [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2177.22s)]
*  They would just have a table with a hole in the middle, [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2179.22s)]
*  and then the monkey's head would be just coming through that hole, [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2181.22s)]
*  and they would just cut open the monkey's head [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2184.22s)]
*  and eat the monkey's brain as the monkey's still alive [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2186.22s)]
*  and just squiggling under the table. [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2189.22s)]
*  Oh, really? [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2191.22s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2192.22s)]
*  I don't know how true that is, but I like to believe that. [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2193.22s)]
*  We eat everything. [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2194.22s)]
*  I love that. [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2195.22s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2196.22s)]
*  I love thinking about Asian... [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2197.22s)]
*  It's a bit inhumane though, right? [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2198.22s)]
*  It's next level to the snail musage, the stuff. [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2200.22s)]
*  But monkeys are... [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2203.22s)]
*  They deserve some of it. [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2205.22s)]
*  No, they're nice. [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2207.22s)]
*  They're nice. [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2208.22s)]
*  They're smart. [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2209.22s)]
*  They're smarter. [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2210.22s)]
*  Yeah, I agree. [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2211.22s)]
*  Every now and then you see one who fucking, you know, [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2212.22s)]
*  knows how to open bag of Doritos or something. [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2213.22s)]
*  Yeah, they can paint. [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2215.22s)]
*  But overall, they're fine. [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2216.22s)]
*  They're cute too, no? [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2217.22s)]
*  Put monkeys attacking women for chips. [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2219.22s)]
*  Well, that's bias. [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2222.22s)]
*  You can also Google monkeys being cute and loving. [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2223.22s)]
*  Okay. [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2226.22s)]
*  You know? [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2227.22s)]
*  Let's see both. [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2228.22s)]
*  We'll do a video for each. [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2229.22s)]
*  The woman who was mauled by a 200-pound chimp. [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2230.22s)]
*  Okay. [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2233.22s)]
*  That's not a monkey. [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2234.22s)]
*  That's like King Kong, you know? [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2235.22s)]
*  I'm just saying this lady probably had a little bit of chips on her. [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2237.22s)]
*  I watched some monkeys attack a sister for a sack of vinegar salt chips one time on a stairwell. [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2241.22s)]
*  Okay. [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2247.22s)]
*  I need to know more context, you know? [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2248.22s)]
*  Okay. [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2250.22s)]
*  So go to his version now. [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2251.22s)]
*  What do you want to pull up? [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2252.22s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2253.22s)]
*  Monkeys being cute. [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2254.22s)]
*  Monkeys being cute. [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2255.22s)]

*  Who is that? [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2270.22s)]
*  Oh, that's Justin Trudeau. [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2271.22s)]
*  He's not running for office, he's swinging for office from his tail. [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2273.22s)]
*  That is cute. [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2291.74s)]

*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2295.58s)]

*  Beautiful monkey. [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2301.58s)]
*  Yeah, he's so tiny. That monkey can't beat anyone. [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2303.58s)]
*  Very romantic. [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2306.58s)]
*  What made you decide to go into a food direction on your YouTube, man? [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2307.58s)]
*  And some of my audience won't be familiar with Nigel or Uncle Roger, and that's okay, right? [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2311.58s)]
*  But it's the way you kind of effortlessly kind of just like, I think you seem, this is what it is to me. [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2317.58s)]
*  And this is very judgmental. [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2324.58s)]
*  Alright, here we go. [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2326.58s)]
*  I'm used to seeing some Asian people be more probably quiet or not have maybe the similar sense of humor. [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2327.58s)]
*  And I think your humor seems very similar and relatable to just somebody like me. [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2333.58s)]
*  Oh, thank you. [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2339.58s)]
*  So, and I don't mean it like it's a judgment because it's like, well, what does that matter? Right? [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2340.58s)]
*  But I think that's why it seems so like your humor. [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2346.58s)]
*  Sometimes I feel like maybe some Asian humor, I wouldn't get it. [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2349.58s)]
*  Or even if it's an Asian person with American humor, I wouldn't get it as much. [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2352.58s)]
*  But yeah, yours just seems so like effortless and comes across, man. [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2356.58s)]
*  I feel like every family has an Uncle Roger type character, right? [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2360.58s)]
*  This person who likes to talk shit. [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2363.58s)]
*  This know-it-all who likes to talk shit, loudmouth person who's just roasting everyone. [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2365.58s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2369.58s)]
*  I think every culture has someone like that. [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2370.58s)]
*  Maybe pedophile or none? [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2371.58s)]
*  No, no pedophile. [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2372.58s)]
*  Okay. [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2373.58s)]
*  Keep it PG. [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2374.58s)]
*  Okay, fine. [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2375.58s)]
*  Whatever, man. [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2376.58s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2377.58s)]
*  Whatever. [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2378.58s)]
*  I'm just asking what the question is. [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2379.58s)]
*  Do they have pedophiles in Malaysia though? [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2381.58s)]
*  They have or no? [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2383.58s)]
*  Yeah, of course. [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2384.58s)]
*  Okay. [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2385.58s)]
*  Yeah, they start young. [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2386.58s)]
*  Sometimes they start young. [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2387.58s)]
*  Sometimes it's allowed too. [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2388.58s)]
*  Oh, really? [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2389.58s)]
*  You know? [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2390.58s)]
*  They're different cultures. [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2391.58s)]
*  I think sometimes they marry really young and... [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2392.58s)]
*  Like the Burmese or whatever? [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2395.58s)]
*  The Burmese. [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2397.58s)]
*  I don't know what specific Asian culture is. [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2398.58s)]
*  But I know of other people who are in Malaysia who marry a 14-year-old. [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2399.58s)]
*  It's rare. [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2405.58s)]
*  It's rare. [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2406.58s)]
*  And it's very frowned upon and illegal, I think. [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2407.58s)]
*  I don't know the Malaysian constitution that well. [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2409.58s)]
*  But yeah, every country has a pedophile problem, man. [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2412.58s)]
*  It's just that I think in the US, your pedophiles are higher profile. [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2414.58s)]
*  They're successful pedophiles here. [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2417.58s)]
*  Yeah, that's crazy. [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2419.58s)]
*  It's like, well, this guy's great at business. [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2420.58s)]
*  What's his secret? [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2422.58s)]
*  And his secret is petting kids or whatever. [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2423.58s)]
*  You're like, well, that's... [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2426.58s)]
*  I'll just do a vitamin D supplement or whatever. [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2428.58s)]
*  You have a whole island. [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2430.58s)]
*  You have Epstein. [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2431.58s)]
*  Yeah, we had Epstein. [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2433.58s)]
*  It's great. [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2434.58s)]
*  We don't have someone like that. [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2435.58s)]
*  Asia Consent, Malaysia 16. [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2436.58s)]

*  I like that. [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2468.58s)]
*  Pedophiles need to move away from Bahrain. [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2469.58s)]
*  Bahrainian pedophiles need to move to Japan. [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2471.58s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2474.58s)]

*  Yeah. [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2480.58s)]
*  Oh, why talk about food? [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2481.58s)]
*  So you got into food. [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2483.58s)]
*  Yes. [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2484.58s)]
*  Your channel seems like it kind of really started to focus more on food. [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2485.58s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2488.58s)]
*  Well, you know, I grew up growing up. [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2489.58s)]
*  I think most Malaysians, most Asians love food and we have opinions, a lot of opinions on food and where the best thing is and what is the best fried rice, for instance, you know? [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2490.58s)]
*  So during COVID, I remember I went full time stand up comedy September 2019. [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2498.58s)]
*  So six months before COVID hit, I was like, finally I saved up enough money. [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2504.58s)]
*  I got enough paying gigs that I can make a living off of stand up. [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2507.58s)]
*  And then COVID hit six months later. [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2511.58s)]
*  I lost all my work. [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2513.58s)]
*  So I had to be like, OK, I have all this time on my hands. [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2514.58s)]
*  What do I do? [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2517.58s)]
*  You know, I have this idea for this character in my head. [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2518.58s)]
*  And then one day somebody sent me that the very first video that BBC food, this woman making egg fried rice. [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2521.58s)]
*  And I was just watching and I was just like, this is horrendous. [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2527.58s)]
*  This is horrible. [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2530.58s)]
*  So let's put that character idea with this reaction video, YouTube idea. [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2531.58s)]
*  And then things just took off from there. [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2535.58s)]
*  So and I realized food is relatable, you know, to Asian people, to everyone. [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2537.58s)]
*  Right. Fried rice. [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2543.58s)]
*  Everybody's had fried rice before. [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2544.58s)]
*  So good. [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2545.58s)]
*  Black, you know, doesn't matter what race you are. [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2546.58s)]
*  Everybody likes it. [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2547.58s)]
*  Yeah, everybody likes it. [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2548.58s)]
*  Everybody likes it. [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2549.58s)]
*  Everybody has had it. [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2550.58s)]
*  Everybody has an opinion on it. [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2551.58s)]
*  Is there fried rice, crispy treats or no? [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2552.58s)]
*  No, we can start one. [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2554.58s)]
*  That's a good idea. [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2556.58s)]
*  Fried rice, crispy treats for a little packet. [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2557.58s)]
*  I like that. [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2560.58s)]
*  Yeah, but it's too sweet, though. [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2562.58s)]
*  It's very sweet. [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2564.58s)]
*  You can come out with a savory one. [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2565.58s)]
*  Yeah, that that is the BBC food, egg fried rice video. [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2566.58s)]
*  The one that I reacted to. [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2569.58s)]
*  And what is it? [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2571.58s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2572.58s)]
*  Who is that? [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2573.58s)]
*  Her name's Herschel Patel. [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2574.58s)]
*  We did a video together. [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2575.58s)]
*  Wow. [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2576.58s)]
*  She was just, you know, like a collateral damage. [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2577.58s)]
*  She was just a presenter. [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2580.58s)]
*  And the BBC gave her this recipe. [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2582.58s)]
*  And Herschel, she's got her pronouns are heavy in her first name. [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2584.58s)]
*  Her-shah. [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2588.58s)]
*  Oh, wow. [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2592.58s)]
*  So she does a lot of bizarre things, you know, like. [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2593.58s)]
*  I don't care. [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2595.58s)]
*  I would buy her a damn omelet somewhere. [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2597.58s)]
*  Yeah, he's making the rice and. [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2600.58s)]
*  And so what is she? [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2602.58s)]
*  This is your, you know her? [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2603.58s)]
*  Yeah, after the video went viral and she was under a lot of. [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2606.58s)]
*  She got a lot of hate messages. [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2610.58s)]
*  About this video? [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2612.58s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2613.58s)]
*  For making bad rice. [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2614.58s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2615.58s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2616.58s)]
*  So this is like a Meghan Markle effect or whatever. [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2617.58s)]
*  Yeah, something. [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2619.58s)]
*  And then I realized my videos where I critique when I roast celebrity chefs. [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2620.58s)]
*  Oh, yeah, good. [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2624.58s)]
*  Those go really viral. [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2625.58s)]
*  They do super well. [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2627.58s)]
*  And then after doing it for a few more years, I was like, OK, people trust me when I talk about food, [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2628.58s)]
*  because I try to keep it honest. [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2633.58s)]
*  If the food is good, I say it's good. [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2635.58s)]
*  If it's bad, I say it's bad. [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2636.58s)]
*  So that's why I think I think I can make, you know, do some good business in the food world. [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2638.58s)]
*  That's why now I have I have restaurants and running a cookbook, all that stuff. [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2642.58s)]
*  And it's fun, man. [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2647.58s)]
*  It's like fun. [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2648.58s)]
*  You know, I've done the I love stand up still. [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2649.58s)]
*  I just don't have the time to do it anymore. [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2651.58s)]
*  And I'm taking a break from it because I realized I'm not I wasn't devoting enough time to it. [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2653.58s)]
*  You know, at most I could do two sets a week and that's not enough. [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2657.58s)]
*  That's not enough. [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2661.58s)]
*  You get you feel so rusty the first 10 minutes of your set. [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2662.58s)]
*  You're getting rid of that rust and you can't really get better. [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2665.58s)]
*  So maybe one day when things settle down a bit, I'll get back to stand up because I love it. [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2668.58s)]
*  It's just that, you know, that instant reaction from people. [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2673.58s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2676.58s)]
*  Well, it's also it's you know, it's funny. [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2677.58s)]
*  I think how if you try like was it scary to try your first that first kind of food video? [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2678.58s)]
*  Because it's interesting for an entertainer if you're in a certain world or space, right? [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2684.58s)]
*  It's interesting to then try something different. [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2688.58s)]
*  You're like, well, my friend does this and it's really neat. [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2691.58s)]
*  He does it super well. [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2694.58s)]
*  But if I do it, is mine going to be OK? [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2696.58s)]
*  Are people going to perceive it as OK? [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2699.58s)]
*  Right. I think that's a big fear. [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2701.58s)]
*  You know, I have friends that do great sketches like Shane Gillis does some really great sketches like his. [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2703.58s)]
*  Yeah, great. [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2709.58s)]
*  Yeah. Gillian Keeves. [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2710.58s)]
*  Oh, I love that ISIS Toyota sketch. [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2712.58s)]
*  Some of it is just so, so funny. [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2715.58s)]
*  And there's times where it's like I'll think of a great sketch. [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2718.58s)]
*  I'll write it on my phone. [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2720.58s)]
*  I'm like, well, if I did that, would it be OK? [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2721.58s)]
*  Would I be too scared? [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2723.58s)]
*  But it's like I think you think like that. [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2724.58s)]
*  Right. It's normal. [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2726.58s)]
*  It's normal. [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2727.58s)]
*  It's normal to think like that. [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2728.58s)]
*  But nobody cares, dude. [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2729.58s)]
*  Right. That's the truth. [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2730.58s)]
*  Right. [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2731.58s)]
*  But then I don't know if somebody saw somebody doing something like a bunch of like, oh, this isn't the avenue for them. [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2732.58s)]
*  But then if you're if you have a good instinct for yourself, you would kind of notice that as well. [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2737.58s)]
*  Here's what I'm asking you. [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2742.58s)]
*  Was it hard to do that? [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2743.58s)]
*  Was it hard to just take that leap and be like, I'm going to try this different thing? [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2744.58s)]
*  Oh, yeah. Yeah. [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2747.58s)]
*  You fear I fear the judgment of every back because back then in the UK, nobody was doing YouTube. [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2748.58s)]
*  You know, it was just a weird thing for someone. [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2754.58s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2757.58s)]
*  A stand up to do people. [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2758.58s)]
*  Other stand ups would be like, oh, yeah, he's just a YouTuber. [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2760.58s)]
*  You know, that kind of slur. [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2762.58s)]
*  Right. [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2764.58s)]
*  Yeah. YouTube. [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2765.58s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2766.58s)]
*  YouTuber. [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2767.58s)]
*  But no hard are on it. [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2768.58s)]
*  You too. [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2769.58s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2770.58s)]
*  That's crazy. [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2771.58s)]
*  YouTuber, please. [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2772.58s)]
*  Oh, have you heard that song? [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2773.58s)]
*  YouTubers can be gay, too. [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2774.58s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2776.58s)]
*  Have you heard it? [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2777.58s)]
*  No. [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2778.58s)]
*  I'll watch it. [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2779.58s)]
*  Right. [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2780.58s)]
*  You got to hear this song. [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2781.58s)]
*  It's great. [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2782.58s)]
*  There's just like a it's a summer bop that's really taken over. [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2783.58s)]
*  And then we'll get back to this. [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2785.58s)]
*  This isolation is. [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2786.58s)]
*  Let me explain this to you. [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2787.58s)]
*  Niggas can be gay, too. [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2788.58s)]
*  Hell yeah. [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2789.58s)]
*  That's a little bit of a [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2790.58s)]
*  What a banger. [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2802.98s)]
*  This is that banger, bro. [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2803.98s)]
*  We got to remix this shit for the summer, dude. [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2805.98s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2807.98s)]
*  Very hard to sing along. [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2808.98s)]
*  That's in your car. [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2810.98s)]
*  You can say this in your car. [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2812.98s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2813.98s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2814.98s)]
*  You just say this to your friend. [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2815.98s)]
*  He's not wrong, though. [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2816.98s)]
*  They can't be gay. [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2817.98s)]
*  I support this guy. [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2818.98s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2819.98s)]
*  Hey, this guy has a vote for me, bro. [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2820.98s)]
*  It needs to be said. [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2821.98s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2822.98s)]
*  That's too much toxic. [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2823.98s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2824.98s)]
*  Who likes that zesty barbecue? [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2826.98s)]
*  They snuck it in on us. [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2827.98s)]
*  They snuck it in on us with that zesty barbecue. [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2828.98s)]
*  But let's get back to what you were saying. [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2829.98s)]
*  Sorry. [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2830.98s)]
*  I just in terms of the [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2831.98s)]
*  The [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2833.98s)]
*  I'm saying, boy. Sometimes the best seasoning is a little bit of zest. [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2839.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2843.9s)]
*  Who likes that zesty barbecue? They snuck it in on us. They snuck it in on us with that zesty barbecue. [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2845.66s)]
*  But let's go back to what you were saying. Sorry. I just, anytime I get a chance, I love this artist, [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2853.02s)]
*  Yves. And so I just want to be able to support him and put out his song that I think is a [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2859.18s)]
*  banger and has not gotten the vibes it should have gotten so far. [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2862.86s)]
*  And it just needs to be resurrected because it's been about eight years since that song came out. [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2868.2200000000003s)]
*  What is, I wonder, does in Asian culture even, because Asian culture to me, right? And I know [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2872.78s)]
*  I relate things to culture a lot, but I think it's played a big role in my life, I think somehow. [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2878.6200000000003s)]
*  But Asian people seem more reserved overall, right? We kind of talked about that. [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2885.0200000000004s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2889.26s)]
*  So is that even scarier to put yourself out there in an Asian, like as an Asian, you think, [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2889.76s)]
*  than it would be in other cultures where it's more like boisterous, you know? [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2895.1s)]
*  Never thought about this. I think it would be, you know, in the U.S., I think people here [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2898.94s)]
*  like it when you're being creative. At least they're supportive, you know, like you go, [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2904.14s)]
*  you do you. People are more positive here. [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2908.22s)]
*  You can be gay too, man. [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2910.86s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2911.66s)]
*  If you try to put that song in Malaysia, Asians can be gay too, that's not going to go far. [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2913.02s)]
*  I think in some countries that would be illegal as well. [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2921.98s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2925.1s)]
*  Asians can be gay too. [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2925.8199999999997s)]
*  Muslims can be gay too. [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2928.22s)]
*  Dude, that song needs a remake in every culture. [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2931.2599999999998s)]
*  Yeah, so I just wondered if it was even scarier and what like, I guess, what got you that, [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2935.18s)]
*  what made you kind of brave enough to take that leap? Because in my life, I've noticed that the [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2939.98s)]
*  toughest thing is just that first step every time. [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2944.62s)]
*  Well, I went to university here and that helped. I went to Northwestern and it's, [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2947.2599999999998s)]
*  you know, I was very lucky I got a scholarship because it's an expensive school. But a lot of [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2951.5s)]
*  people who go there are like very upper middle class, mostly white Midwestern kids. [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2955.5s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2960.5400000000004s)]
*  All so confident. And even though they have the exact wrong answer, [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2961.02s)]
*  but they're still like just saying it with their chest. [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2965.82s)]
*  You're talking about being a Kappa Sig, dude, I think. [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2970.6200000000003s)]
*  Something like that. I wasn't very popular with the frat people. [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2973.34s)]
*  They have their own culture, right? When you talk about culture, frat is his own culture. [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2978.54s)]
*  Oh, yeah, they like to vomit on each other until somebody's secretly gay. [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2981.98s)]
*  You know what I'm saying, dude? That's the type shit I'm into. Type shit, boy. Shout out, Pikes. [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2985.42s)]
*  Can you still do those things? The hazing rituals. It's just sexual assault, but on peep, [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2991.18s)]
*  on your friends. [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2996.2999999999997s)]
*  I didn't know vomit could be a lubricant, but hey, here's another bush light, Ricky. [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=2998.38s)]
*  Yeah, they're just so... And I see them just bullshit their way through university. [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=3004.54s)]
*  I said, I need some of that. I need some of that white male confidence. [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=3010.2200000000003s)]
*  Not too much. You have too much, you become annoying and entitled, right? [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=3015.1800000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=3018.62s)]
*  20% of it. Just a little bit. [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=3018.86s)]
*  Not too much. Yeah, you don't want to turn into Chet Hanks or whatever. [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=3020.54s)]
*  He went to our school. [[00:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=3023.5s)]
*  Did he? [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=3024.46s)]
*  Northwestern. Yeah. [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=3024.86s)]
*  Let's go. [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=3025.58s)]
*  Nice, man. He came to see... I was in a black sketch comedy group back in university. [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=3026.3s)]
*  Chet Hanks and Tom Hanks were at our show once, and Rita Wilson, Tom's wife. [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=3031.18s)]
*  And they all came to your show? [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=3034.94s)]
*  Yeah, they came to the show. It was me and a group of people. [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=3035.74s)]
*  Black folks? [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=3038.7s)]
*  Yeah, mostly black folks. They always need one Asian guy and one white person. [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=3040.14s)]
*  So that was a token. He was a token. [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=3043.58s)]
*  We got the pass to say the N-word in certain sketches. [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=3046.94s)]
*  You did? [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=3049.1s)]
*  It was cool. Yeah. [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=3049.5s)]
*  Oh, wow. They're doing that at Northwestern? [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=3050.2999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=3052.94s)]
*  Hell yeah. That's what the N stands for, Northwestern, dude. [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=3053.8199999999997s)]
*  That's what I'm talking about. That's what we need more of. [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=3057.58s)]
*  Dude, I've said this for years. And not for years, but I've said this for almost four months. [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=3060.22s)]
*  If you had... If you auctioned off the N-word, say somebody's going to say it, right? [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=3065.2599999999998s)]
*  Like tonight, Uncle Roger is going to drop the N-bomb at 11 p.m., right? [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=3069.8999999999996s)]
*  But you auction it off. You say, I'm going to donate money to watch the stream. [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=3074.2999999999997s)]
*  I'm going to pay. They say it, and the money goes towards like a black organization. [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=3078.22s)]
*  Yeah. I think that would work. I think that's a good idea. [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=3082.4599999999996s)]
*  Yeah. But do you have limitations in how they say it? [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=3085.66s)]
*  No, I think they just get... They have to say it within three or four minutes. [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=3090.22s)]
*  So they could do like a little bit of a dance ensemble and then say it at the end. [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=3093.3399999999997s)]
*  Like, da-da-da-da-da-da. [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=3096.7s)]
*  Hard R or no hard R? [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=3099.3399999999997s)]
*  I think it's up to them. And I think it's at what price level you pay. [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=3100.8599999999997s)]
*  Like say Angelina Jolie is going to drop that thing, right? [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=3103.98s)]
*  Okay. I mean... [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=3106.8599999999997s)]
*  I would tune in to watch that. [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=3108.3799999999997s)]
*  I think more people would like that than that fucking Imagine song that they did a few years ago. [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=3109.98s)]
*  Oh, yeah. Yeah. Imagine words. That's what I'm saying, dude. [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=3115.2599999999998s)]
*  That's what they need to do. So I'm just saying... [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=3120.06s)]
*  Because people are always talking about reparations, this reparations, that. [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=3121.66s)]
*  But you're out here policing people for the N-word. [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=3124.86s)]
*  Organize. That's a great idea. [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=3128.14s)]
*  And make some money for your community by auctioning off. People are already saying it. [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=3129.74s)]
*  Yeah, for free. [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=3134.38s)]
*  Yeah, that's our problem. [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=3135.18s)]
*  Dude, I love this. This is like the United Nations meeting, dude. [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=3138.46s)]
*  Let's start a Twitch stream, okay? [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=3141.58s)]
*  And tonight, who would be the best that you would love to hear say the N-word? [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=3145.58s)]
*  And let's be honest, and this isn't a racial thing. [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=3149.82s)]
*  This is just about vernacular and raising money for a community. [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=3151.42s)]
*  I want to see Trevor Wallace say the N-word. [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=3154.54s)]
*  Yeah, because he does not say it. [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=3157.6600000000003s)]
*  But he looks like he wants to say it sometimes. [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=3159.26s)]
*  Oh, if you tickle him. [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=3162.46s)]
*  I bet he says it in his sleep. This is sleep talking. [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=3165.1800000000003s)]
*  Sorry, Trevor. [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=3169.02s)]
*  Oh, yeah. He puts the N in Amdian, dude. You know what I'm talking about. [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=3169.98s)]
*  What's up, Kyle? [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=3174.6200000000003s)]
*  Oh, dude, that would be so great. [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=3176.3s)]
*  Yeah, I'd love to see that. [[00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=3179.9s)]
*  Yeah, I would love to see Trevor Wallace. [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=3180.94s)]
*  And then who's someone that's older that I would love to see say it? [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=3182.3s)]
*  Someone who's probably like in a coma or something. [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=3185.6600000000003s)]
*  But if you could get him to whisper it or something for like an expensive stream. [[00:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=3187.5800000000004s)]
*  I'm talking like about a $13, $14 stream. [[00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=3191.26s)]
*  Who's somebody? Look up older people in coma celebrities or people on there struggling. [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=3194.54s)]
*  Something like that. [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=3199.82s)]
*  Old people who are struggling. [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=3201.26s)]
*  Put almost RIP you can put on there. [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=3203.02s)]
*  Clint Eastwood. [[00:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=3205.82s)]
*  That would be a legend. [[00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=3207.82s)]
*  He did it for free. [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=3209.1000000000004s)]
*  That would be legendary. [[00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=3210.0600000000004s)]
*  There's like three movies about him almost saying it. [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=3215.7400000000002s)]
*  Oh, Buzz Aldrin. Definitely, dude. [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=3220.2200000000003s)]
*  Yeah. Is he the guy who went to the moon? [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=3222.86s)]
*  Yeah, you know, if you're out in space, you got to yell it out there. [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=3225.5800000000004s)]
*  Yeah, nobody can hear it. Only Houston can hear it. [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=3228.2200000000003s)]
*  We got a problem. Houston, we have a problem. [[00:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=3232.3s)]
*  Yeah. Paul Wall, baby. I'm the people's champ. [[00:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=3235.7400000000002s)]
*  We got a problem, Houston. Buzz is racist. Really racist. [[00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=3239.42s)]
*  You don't think a white guy named Buzz was driving an Inbox? [[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=3244.46s)]
*  After a few whiskeys. [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=3248.14s)]
*  After a few whiskeys and fake trips to the moon, you don't think he's driving a fucking Inbox? [[00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=3251.34s)]
*  First of all, if you send me to a fake moon and drug me up and send me to a fake moon, [[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=3256.06s)]
*  I get one Inbox, man. [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=3260.22s)]
*  He could open up for Angelina Jolie. [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=3261.98s)]
*  But it's just good to think about how you can raise money. [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=3264.14s)]
*  And that's where I'm at. It's like, you know, are we raising money or not? [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=3266.22s)]
*  I wish we had such a cool like racial slur for Asian people. [[00:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=3271.02s)]
*  You know, we got we got but it's nowhere near the cultural coolness. [[00:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=3274.8599999999997s)]
*  Yeah, I'm trying to think of Chop Dogs would be good, but that's kind of fun. [[00:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=3279.98s)]
*  Yeah, that's funny. That's funny to say. [[00:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=3284.46s)]
*  Look at my Chop Dogs right here. [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=3286.94s)]
*  Yeah, look at best Asian racial slurs if you can. [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=3288.94s)]
*  Sorry. [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=3291.66s)]
*  That's probably on X, not on YouTube. [[00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=3294.7s)]
*  Best Asian slurs. [[00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=3297.3399999999997s)]
*  Yeah, at Elon. [[00:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=3298.46s)]
*  Excuse me, Grock. [[00:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=3301.74s)]
*  Do you know if these slurs are definitely Asian? [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=3302.7s)]
*  Let's just look at a couple. [[00:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=3305.98s)]
*  I don't want to get crazy. [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=3307.02s)]

*  It feels like a corporate crowd, but tougher. [[01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=3646.88s)]
*  Well, I just didn't expect the camera. [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=3648.56s)]
*  So suddenly, everything has to change. [[01:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=3649.92s)]
*  You're like, what do I do now? [[01:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=3652.32s)]
*  And so it was just like this interesting mix. [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=3656.08s)]
*  But then I also like, before I went out there, I was like, [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=3658.2400000000002s)]
*  asking God, I was like, just don't make it about me. [[01:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=3661.28s)]
*  Let me just try and do my best. [[01:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=3663.12s)]
*  You know, so then I realized, it's just you're over there [[01:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=3665.04s)]
*  to have fun. [[01:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=3668.0s)]
*  So we stayed after and took a ton of photos. [[01:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=3668.48s)]
*  And it was cool, man, just to be on the base and see like- [[01:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=3670.32s)]
*  I've done some military tours in the past, [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=3674.96s)]
*  but just to be there and just see what people- [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=3676.48s)]
*  just what people are living like over there [[01:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=3680.4s)]
*  and what the environment is like over there. [[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=3682.1600000000003s)]
*  And then we got to drive across town, [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=3684.64s)]
*  and all the buildings have- [[01:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=3687.04s)]
*  bring up like basic, or what's it called? [[01:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=3689.04s)]
*  Common structure structuring. [[01:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=3691.52s)]
*  In Qatar, all of their stuff have like the castle, [[01:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=3694.56s)]
*  like you know that like castles are kind of like that [[01:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=3697.76s)]
*  on the top of them? [[01:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=3700.2400000000002s)]
*  Let me see. [[01:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=3701.36s)]
*  I don't fully understand. [[01:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=3701.92s)]
*  Like, you know the rook in where you're playing- [[01:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=3703.84s)]
*  Rook is a castle. [[01:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=3706.32s)]
*  Yeah, the rook is the castle. [[01:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=3707.2000000000003s)]
*  So it has the castle top, you know, the top of the castles [[01:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=3708.2400000000002s)]
*  like that? [[01:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=3710.8s)]
*  All of their buildings there are like that. [[01:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=3711.76s)]
*  So you'll be driving by a place and you're like, [[01:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=3714.8s)]
*  oh my God, is that a palace? [[01:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=3716.8s)]
*  And they're like, that's a KFC, dude. [[01:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=3718.4s)]
*  Every building there has the castling tops. [[01:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=3721.44s)]
*  And it's all very uniform and there's nothing out of place. [[01:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=3725.68s)]
*  There's not a tree out of place. [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=3728.48s)]
*  There's not a curve of a sidewalk out of place. [[01:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=3730.08s)]
*  Nothing's on- [[01:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=3733.52s)]
*  It's like- [[01:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=3734.32s)]
*  Wow. [[01:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=3735.04s)]
*  It's unbelievable. [[01:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=3735.52s)]
*  They have a lot of money because everybody there gets [[01:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=3737.92s)]
*  subsidized from the government if you're a Qatari citizen. [[01:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=3742.08s)]
*  Yeah, but it's impossible to be a Qatari citizen, isn't it? [[01:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=3744.96s)]
*  Right. [[01:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=3747.44s)]
*  It only travels through the mail. [[01:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=3747.68s)]
*  So you can't just- [[01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=3749.68s)]
*  And you can't just have a baby on the land and it's a citizen. [[01:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=3751.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=3754.3199999999997s)]
*  Can you be gay and marry a male and get it that way? [[01:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=3755.04s)]
*  Let's see. [[01:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=3757.8399999999997s)]
*  That's a great question because you always hear that you can't be gay there or whatever. [[01:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=3758.16s)]
*  And it's funny, they had the secret service there and I kept going up to him. [[01:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=3762.7999999999997s)]
*  I'm like, what's your secret? [[01:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=3765.2799999999997s)]
*  If you're gay, just say it. [[01:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=3767.6s)]
*  What's your secret? [[01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=3770.08s)]
*  You wore your mom's underpants. [[01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=3770.7999999999997s)]
*  Like, what is it? [[01:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=3772.48s)]
*  And every now and then one would slightly show me a gun. [[01:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=3773.52s)]
*  Just like- [[01:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=3777.2s)]
*  Shut the fuck up. [[01:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=3779.52s)]
*  And then that's when I would listen to N words can be gay too. [[01:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=3780.3199999999997s)]
*  Let's play that in the ears. [[01:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=3784.72s)]
*  Pathways to Qatari citizenship. [[01:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=3788.08s)]
*  Citizenship is automatically granted anyone born to a Qatari father regardless of birthplace. [[01:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=3789.68s)]
*  Oh, interesting. [[01:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=3794.16s)]
*  Children of Qatari mothers and non-Qatari fathers may apply for citizenship, [[01:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=3795.8399999999997s)]
*  but only under strict conditions are not guaranteed citizenship. [[01:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=3799.6s)]
*  Foreigners can apply for citizenship after at least 25 consecutive years of lawful residence. [[01:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=3804.2400000000002s)]
*  Wow. [[01:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=3809.28s)]
*  Wow. [[01:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=3809.92s)]
*  With no more than two months spent outside the country per year. [[01:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=3810.8s)]
*  Oh my God, with no more than two months spent outside the country per year. [[01:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=3814.2400000000002s)]
*  Whereas in America, you could hang your lower half over a fence and drop something over here [[01:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=3817.12s)]
*  that's American. [[01:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=3822.08s)]
*  Which is kind of cool actually. [[01:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=3823.76s)]
*  I think there is that golden visa thing in America now, right? [[01:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=3825.68s)]
*  Five million dollars or something. [[01:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=3829.36s)]
*  They're giving that away. [[01:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=3830.88s)]
*  I think it's where America's got citizenship. [[01:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=3831.68s)]
*  I think Howie Mandel is one of the hosts of it. [[01:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=3834.64s)]
*  But dual citizenship is not permitted. [[01:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=3836.3199999999997s)]
*  Applicants must renounce their previous citizenship upon naturalization. [[01:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=3838.48s)]
*  I think that's important. [[01:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=3842.16s)]
*  So you can't be gay. [[01:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=3843.3599999999997s)]
*  Oh wait, legal status of same-sex marriage. [[01:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=3844.72s)]
*  Same-sex marriage, civil unions and domestic partnerships are not recognized or legal in Qatar. [[01:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=3847.6s)]
*  Qatari law influenced by traditional Islamic principles criminalizes same-sex sexual activity [[01:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=3854.0s)]
*  and does not recognize any legal status for same-sex couples. [[01:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=3859.6s)]
*  Cohabitation outside of heterosexual marriage is also illegal. [[01:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=3863.12s)]
*  Wow. [[01:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=3866.4s)]
*  So there's no way for us to be Qatari citizens. [[01:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=3867.8399999999997s)]
*  In our next life, I believe in reincarnation. [[01:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=3872.48s)]
*  I'll meet you there, brother. [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=3875.6s)]
*  See you there, man. [[01:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=3876.56s)]
*  Play our song. [[01:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=3878.0s)]
*  What is the... [[01:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=3887.2s)]
*  What's the improper way to cook rice just for whites and listeners of this? [[01:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=3889.6s)]
*  That's what I built my whole career off of. [[01:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=3894.0s)]
*  Is it really? [[01:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=3895.8399999999997s)]
*  I think the proper way is just get a rice cooker. [[01:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=3896.64s)]
*  You have one of those? [[01:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=3900.72s)]
*  No, I lived with an Asian girl when I first moved to Los Angeles. [[01:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=3902.0s)]
*  She needs to educate you on that stuff, man. [[01:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=3905.6s)]
*  Oh, we couldn't even afford heat. [[01:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=3907.52s)]
*  Sometimes we'd have her turn that on in our room for a little while. [[01:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=3909.44s)]
*  Oh, shit. [[01:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=3911.8399999999997s)]
*  But now things are different now, right? [[01:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=3912.88s)]
*  You can afford a rice cooker now. [[01:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=3914.4s)]
*  Oh yeah, I can have a rice cooker in each room. [[01:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=3915.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=3917.4399999999996s)]
*  You can just be making rice. [[01:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=3919.2799999999997s)]
*  You can have an Asian in each room making rice for you. [[01:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=3920.7999999999997s)]
*  That's how fun you can afford now. [[01:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=3922.96s)]
*  Oh, I would love that. [[01:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=3923.9199999999996s)]
*  A little cinnamon Asian. [[01:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=3925.04s)]
*  The sugar book person. [[01:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=3925.7599999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=3926.96s)]
*  $80 a week. [[01:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=3927.4399999999996s)]
*  Just come make rice for me, girl. [[01:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=3928.48s)]
*  But a rice cooker is great because it just takes care of everything for you. [[01:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=3931.9199999999996s)]
*  And when it's done, it keeps it warm. [[01:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=3934.64s)]
*  So you can just press play, go out, do your thing, come back, rice is ready. [[01:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=3936.8799999999997s)]
*  That's it. [[01:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=3940.64s)]
*  And it smells good. [[01:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=3941.12s)]
*  It's perfect. [[01:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=3942.08s)]
*  So no way to do... [[01:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=3942.72s)]
*  So doing anything crazy with rice where you're boiling all that, [[01:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=3943.68s)]
*  it's kind of ridiculous. [[01:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=3946.72s)]
*  You can just do a rice cooker easy. [[01:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=3947.52s)]
*  Yeah, because every time in the West... [[01:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=3948.7999999999997s)]
*  Okay, here's the difference. [[01:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=3951.2s)]
*  In Asia, you ask someone how to make rice, [[01:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=3952.3999999999996s)]
*  they're like, rice cooker, the story is over. [[01:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=3954.08s)]
*  Over here, I asked them how to make rice. [[01:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=3956.72s)]
*  They give you this long mathematical equation with science [[01:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=3958.24s)]
*  and how many cups of water to... [[01:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=3961.9199999999996s)]
*  One to three ratio of rice to water is a whole science lab breaking bad project. [[01:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=3964.3999999999996s)]
*  Yeah, it's like Andrew Huberman making rice. [[01:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=3969.52s)]
*  Yeah, we don't need that. [[01:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=3971.3599999999997s)]
*  We don't need a whole podcast to make one bowl of rice. [[01:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=3972.56s)]
*  So I recommend everybody just get a rice cooker. [[01:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=3976.48s)]
*  Make life easy for yourself. [[01:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=3978.8s)]
*  Yeah, make it simple. [[01:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=3980.08s)]
*  Just do that. [[01:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=3981.36s)]
*  Do you cook a lot at home? [[01:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=3982.72s)]
*  I only eat two things, honestly, at home. [[01:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=3984.32s)]
*  Smoothie. [[01:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=3989.2s)]
*  I eat one smoothie that has blueberries, spinaches, walnut. [[01:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=3991.04s)]
*  But that eating though, that's not eating. [[01:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=3997.04s)]
*  Protein powder. [[01:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=3998.64s)]
*  Okay. [[01:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=3999.92s)]
*  And food. [[01:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=4001.6s)]
*  Lactose free milk, a little bit of cinnamon. [[01:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=4002.16s)]
*  Half teaspoon of Stamets mushroom powder. [[01:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=4005.2799999999997s)]
*  Some Amra, colostrum. [[01:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=4008.48s)]
*  What else? [[01:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=4013.2799999999997s)]
*  Oh, half a teaspoon of algae, sea algae powder. [[01:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=4013.9199999999996s)]
*  That's fine grain. [[01:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=4018.0s)]
*  Fine grain. [[01:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=4019.9199999999996s)]
*  I don't like that choppy. [[01:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=4020.48s)]
*  What is colostrum? [[01:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=4021.4399999999996s)]
*  Amra, it's something that it's in baby milk. [[01:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=4023.52s)]
*  Is that placenta? [[01:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=4026.0s)]
*  No, it's something in baby milk. [[01:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=4027.04s)]
*  Oh, okay. [[01:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=4028.72s)]
*  Is it good for you? [[01:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=4030.3199999999997s)]
*  I mean, was baby milk good for you? [[01:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=4031.2799999999997s)]
*  Probably. [[01:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=4033.4399999999996s)]
*  I don't remember now. [[01:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=4033.84s)]
*  Oh, you imagine that? [[01:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=4034.6400000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=4035.6800000000003s)]
*  I need to ask my mom. [[01:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=4036.4s)]
*  Was I healthier when I was sucking in your tit? [[01:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=4038.2400000000002s)]
*  Oh, I'm sure I was. [[01:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=4040.1600000000003s)]
*  Dude, look at me now. [[01:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=4041.52s)]
*  Fucking troubled. [[01:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=4043.6000000000004s)]
*  I'm fucking spray tanning my back because I'm losing pigment. [[01:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=4044.56s)]
*  God damn, yeah. [[01:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=4047.04s)]
*  Just getting whiter and whiter. [[01:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=4048.0s)]
*  I love that damn baby milk, tit in milk. [[01:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=4049.44s)]
*  Colostrum. [[01:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=4051.2000000000003s)]
*  Why did you get, that looks like an Air wand thing. [[01:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=4051.92s)]
*  They started dealing, I think we actually do, [[01:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=4055.2000000000003s)]
*  I think we honestly, I think we even do some ads for them. [[01:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=4056.88s)]
*  But so I mix that together in a blender. [[01:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=4059.6000000000004s)]
*  That is my, that's my smoothie. [[01:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=4061.2000000000003s)]
*  That's what I have every time. [[01:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=4062.6400000000003s)]
*  And then other than that, sometimes at night, [[01:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=4063.44s)]
*  about 45 minutes for bed, I'll make myself a ground beef quesadilla. [[01:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=4065.6s)]
*  Okay, okay. [[01:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=4071.84s)]
*  You got to expand your palette, man. [[01:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=4072.8s)]
*  Give it a try. [[01:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=4075.44s)]
*  I don't want that. [[01:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=4076.2400000000002s)]
*  I'll bring you around. [[01:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=4077.04s)]
*  I'll bring you to Koreatown. [[01:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=4078.0s)]
*  But why is it that every time Asians, [[01:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=4079.44s)]
*  they want to take you somewhere to fucking feed you, [[01:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=4081.52s)]
*  that's the thing, bro. [[01:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=4083.6s)]
*  Yeah, we don't like cooking at home. [[01:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=4084.32s)]
*  Oh, really? [[01:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=4086.4s)]
*  Because cooking, there's so much good food here, [[01:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=4087.04s)]
*  that cooking at home is almost arrogant. [[01:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=4088.96s)]
*  You think like what? [[01:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=4091.12s)]
*  You think you can do better than this place, you know? [[01:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=4091.92s)]
*  So I got to bring you somewhere. [[01:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=4095.04s)]
*  Create some joy, let you see some shit. [[01:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=4098.56s)]
*  Fuyo, that's your restaurant? [[01:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=4102.56s)]
*  Fuyo, yeah, yeah. [[01:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=4103.84s)]
*  Fuyo. [[01:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=4104.72s)]
*  Fuyo, it's Uncle Roger. [[01:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=4105.28s)]
*  That's the restaurant name. [[01:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=4106.56s)]
*  Yeah, congratulations, dude. [[01:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=4107.76s)]
*  Thank you, man. [[01:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=4109.12s)]
*  Thank you. [[01:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=4109.84s)]
*  So awesome. [[01:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=4110.16s)]
*  That's only Malaysia right now. [[01:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=4110.96s)]
*  Hopefully, we'll expand this concept to all of Asia. [[01:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=4112.56s)]
*  But later this year, hopefully, we also have something, [[01:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=4116.72s)]
*  a new concept opening in London. [[01:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=4119.28s)]
*  Really? [[01:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=4121.2s)]
*  Yeah, different, this is the first time I'm saying it to the world. [[01:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=4121.68s)]
*  But yeah, we just got the lease for a place in London. [[01:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=4125.76s)]
*  Let's go, Uncle Roger. [[01:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=4128.56s)]
*  Completely different restaurant name and stuff. [[01:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=4130.0s)]
*  Fuyo. [[01:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=4131.04s)]
*  Thank you. [[01:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=4131.84s)]
*  Fuyo is like a Malaysian slang for saying, fuck yeah. [[01:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=4132.320000000001s)]
*  Oh, okay. [[01:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=4135.04s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, nice. [[01:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=4135.6s)]
*  Fuyo. [[01:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=4136.56s)]
*  Fuyo. [[01:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=4137.280000000001s)]
*  Fuyo. [[01:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=4138.240000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I love that, dude. [[01:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=4140.96s)]
*  It's so cool. [[01:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=4142.56s)]
*  And when you went there for the first time, [[01:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=4143.6s)]
*  did you have to go and help design the actual restaurant? [[01:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=4145.4400000000005s)]
*  How did that, how hands-on are you in something like that, right? [[01:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=4147.92s)]
*  Certain aspects. [[01:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=4151.2s)]
*  I came up with a few of the fried rice recipes. [[01:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=4152.16s)]
*  So Fuyo, it's Uncle Roger, is a fast casual fried rice restaurant. [[01:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=4155.76s)]
*  Okay. [[01:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=4159.360000000001s)]
*  So you get fried rice as your base, you can add toppings to it. [[01:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=4159.76s)]
*  Oh, that sounds so good. [[01:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=4162.4800000000005s)]
*  Oh, it's good, man. [[01:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=4164.0s)]
*  We're very proud of our fried rice. [[01:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=4165.04s)]
*  And I came up with a few of the recipes, you know, [[01:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=4166.64s)]
*  this is a kimchi fried rice. [[01:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=4168.64s)]
*  So I decided, yes, we need some seaweed, [[01:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=4171.280000000001s)]
*  we decide how we want to plate it. [[01:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=4173.2s)]
*  You know, the seaweed on the side and the perimeter [[01:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=4174.8s)]
*  and how you want to chop the spring onion. [[01:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=4177.52s)]
*  Many ways to chop spring onion, you got to find the perfect way. [[01:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=4179.5199999999995s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=4181.92s)]
*  It's all a little like bright color, [[01:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=4182.96s)]
*  a little corny from a Western eye, but it works for Asia. [[01:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=4184.48s)]
*  And we like cutesy things and also a lot of kids like it, [[01:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=4189.36s)]
*  younger people like it. [[01:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=4192.639999999999s)]
*  Yeah, it's fun. [[01:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=4193.84s)]
*  Well, also, I think getting younger people to like, [[01:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=4194.639999999999s)]
*  especially like younger American people to like, [[01:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=4196.96s)]
*  just to try something a little bit different, right? [[01:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=4200.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=4202.4s)]
*  Like I think my nephews would love this kind of thing. [[01:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=4202.96s)]
*  Look at the egg, man. [[01:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=4205.44s)]
*  Look at how runny it is. [[01:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=4206.32s)]
*  Oh, that's good. [[01:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=4207.44s)]
*  That's another decision to make. [[01:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=4208.0s)]
*  You got to make the sides crispy and the yolk runny. [[01:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=4209.28s)]
*  That's what Asians like. [[01:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=4212.24s)]
*  You can add some eggs to your diet, man. [[01:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=4214.24s)]
*  Oh, fool. [[01:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=4216.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=4216.96s)]
*  Add some runny eggs to your quesadilla. [[01:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=4217.36s)]
*  I do very, I do a little bit of cheese on there, shredded cheese, quesadilla. [[01:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=4222.4s)]
*  And that's real? [[01:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=4226.96s)]
*  That's the two things you eat every day? [[01:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=4227.84s)]
*  It's the only thing that's... [[01:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=4229.84s)]
*  For real, you're not joking. [[01:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=4230.56s)]
*  It's the only thing that's at my house to eat [[01:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=4231.52s)]
*  and the only thing that's at my apartment to eat. [[01:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=4232.88s)]
*  Wow. [[01:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=4234.4s)]
*  So I have that, put a cheese, put a layer of ground beef, [[01:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=4235.12s)]
*  one more layer of cheese, take some salt, sea salt, put it on there, top on it, [[01:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=4238.88s)]
*  one napkin over it in the microwave, probably a minute, 15 seconds. [[01:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=4244.0s)]
*  When it comes out, I push down on the napkin to strengthen that cheese and that meat combo, [[01:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=4248.48s)]
*  put it all together, make it a team. [[01:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=4253.44s)]
*  Then I'll cut it. [[01:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=4256.32s)]
*  A second I take that napkin off, I cut it four, [[01:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=4257.04s)]
*  and one across one of the bottom, make four pieces. [[01:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=4259.28s)]
*  Do not let it get too cold, brother, it gets bad. [[01:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=4262.5599999999995s)]
*  I need to open a restaurant here, man. [[01:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=4264.8s)]
*  So you're going to experience the joy of eating. [[01:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=4266.320000000001s)]
*  Oh, I would love that, man. [[01:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=4270.0s)]
*  I would love to be associated with your restaurant. [[01:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=4271.04s)]
*  Part of why I took a break from stand-up is because it eats into my dinner time. [[01:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=4273.04s)]
*  That's how much I like food. [[01:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=4277.6s)]
*  It's real, man. [[01:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=4279.12s)]
*  You do a show on tour, I have to sound check at like five, [[01:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=4280.64s)]
*  and then I'm stuck in the green room just eating a cold salad. [[01:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=4284.320000000001s)]
*  And then after the show, you just want to drink, you don't want to eat. [[01:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=4287.360000000001s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=4290.4800000000005s)]
*  Yeah, you're a little bit heightened up. [[01:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=4291.28s)]
*  And then otherwise you're eating at like 11 o'clock at night. [[01:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=4293.04s)]
*  That's never super fun. [[01:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=4295.28s)]
*  No good restaurant is still open at 11. [[01:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=4296.4s)]
*  Nothing. [[01:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=4298.08s)]
*  Even if you try to set up something in advance, you know, [[01:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=4298.96s)]
*  it won't stay open sometimes. [[01:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=4302.88s)]
*  But you can order food. [[01:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=4304.24s)]
*  But yeah, touring is a hectic lifestyle. [[01:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=4305.12s)]
*  How do you stay fit when you're always eating? [[01:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=4308.8s)]
*  Do you also have to take care of yourself or do you want to get turned into fat? [[01:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=4310.96s)]
*  No, I think I got to take care of myself, man. [[01:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=4316.56s)]
*  I wanted my life expectancy to go a little beyond that. [[01:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=4318.48s)]
*  So I just work out. [[01:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=4322.0s)]
*  I try to let my dinner be my all-out meal. [[01:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=4323.52s)]
*  Every dinner is my cheat meal, but every other meal is like a healthy thing. [[01:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=4328.32s)]
*  I try. [[01:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=4332.24s)]

*  And do you eat breakfast? [[01:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=4333.84s)]
*  Do Malaysians eat breakfast? [[01:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=4334.8s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[01:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=4336.16s)]
*  We got some good breakfast, man. [[01:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=4337.52s)]
*  I think best breakfast in the world, we got rice for breakfast. [[01:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=4339.2s)]
*  See, that's the part. [[01:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=4342.64s)]

*  Search this, search nasi lemak, N-A-S-I. [[01:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=4346.32s)]
*  Yeah, Malaysian breakfast. [[01:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=4350.16s)]
*  The first image, that's the one we have. [[01:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=4351.28s)]
*  So look at the variety. [[01:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=4353.2s)]
*  Rice, peanuts, the sambal paste, a red paste there, fried chicken sometimes. [[01:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=4355.28s)]
*  What's a sambal paste? [[01:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=4360.88s)]
*  It's like a chili shrimp paste. [[01:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=4362.32s)]
*  You know, it tastes... [[01:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=4365.6s)]
*  I'm getting hungry now just thinking about this. [[01:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=4367.6s)]

*  I could see that. [[01:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=4379.84s)]

*  So this is another Malaysian breakfast. [[01:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=4388.96s)]
*  This is more Indian Malaysian style. [[01:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=4390.56s)]
*  I like this one. [[01:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=4392.240000000001s)]
*  You have the roti, the thin bread, slightly crispy and airy. [[01:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=4392.72s)]
*  You dip it in that yellow dal. [[01:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=4396.4800000000005s)]

*  But in Qatar, they had a lot of beautiful sauces and stuff too. [[01:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=4404.64s)]
*  Yeah, we love... [[01:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=4407.4400000000005s)]

*  So good. [[01:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=5143.48s)]
*  And I feel like a lot of the times when Western people go to Asia, [[01:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=5144.36s)]
*  they always show the weirdest parts of what Asian people eat. [[01:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=5148.2s)]

*  almost like an insider view of Asia, [[01:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=5157.72s)]
*  compared to like a Western perspective of Asia. [[01:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=5160.04s)]

*  Wow. [[01:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=5354.28s)]
*  Miss Tiffany, a nod to the pageant's original goal of promoting human rights and equality [[01:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=5355.0199999999995s)]
*  for transgender people in Thailand and around the world. [[01:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=5360.3s)]

*  Big part of the culture. [[01:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=5368.219999999999s)]
*  They've dealt with this shit. [[01:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=5369.0199999999995s)]
*  They're ahead of the time. [[01:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=5369.98s)]
*  You know, I think the arguments people have over here about the trans issue. [[01:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=5371.179999999999s)]
*  I think Thailand probably had that 20 years ago, but now it's just part of society. [[01:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=5375.259999999999s)]
*  They don't even think about the pronouns. [[01:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=5380.86s)]
*  They just get called like she, her or whatever they want to get called. [[01:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=5382.54s)]
*  So it's nice. [[01:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=5385.58s)]
*  I think we can learn from that a little bit. [[01:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=5387.1s)]
*  For sure. [[01:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=5389.9s)]

*  That's that old wives tale. [[01:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=5406.3s)]
*  I think you got to tour Thailand next. [[01:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=5409.34s)]
*  Wow. [[01:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=5411.42s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=5412.14s)]
*  I don't want to risk finding out you enjoy this. [[01:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=5412.860000000001s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=5415.740000000001s)]
*  You just, you know, you don't want to accidentally bring sand to the freaking Weiner beach or [[01:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=5416.22s)]
*  whatever, you know? [[01:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=5420.3s)]
*  But yeah. [[01:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=5421.42s)]
*  Oh no, dude. [[01:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=5421.900000000001s)]
*  I think this is great. [[01:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=5422.46s)]
*  But I think the issue that we have in America, and that's just a joke, but I think the issue [[01:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=5423.42s)]
*  that we have in America is that it's you have men using it mostly for sports, right? [[01:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=5426.46s)]
*  It's like, if you're going over to play sports and you know, you're a biological male to me, [[01:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=5431.26s)]
*  it just feels like you're cheating, right? [[01:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=5435.34s)]
*  We should have a, a, a, a, a class. [[01:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=5437.02s)]
*  It's just for trans people and let them compete there and let it be a new thing that we embody [[01:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=5439.9s)]
*  and embrace. [[01:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=5445.42s)]
*  And that's the thing I would try to start if I'm trans, like don't put me in with man [[01:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=5446.0599999999995s)]
*  or put me in with women. [[01:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=5449.98s)]
*  If I'm not exactly as them, let me do something new. [[01:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=5451.099999999999s)]
*  I think that's why they have the pageants. [[01:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=5455.74s)]
*  So they keep them busy with the pageants so they don't do sports. [[01:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=5457.42s)]
*  Oh, that's a good point. [[01:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=5460.299999999999s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[01:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=5461.5s)]
*  If you're too busy. [[01:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=5461.98s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=5463.74s)]
*  These, these are actual biological women and they don't look near as good, nearly as good. [[01:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=5464.379999999999s)]
*  That's a good point. [[01:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=5468.86s)]
*  Huh? [[01:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=5469.9s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=5470.22s)]
*  Maybe we're coming to a unique time in culture where men are tired of being men. [[01:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=5471.099999999999s)]
*  So they would rather spend their time looking like women and women are tired of being women. [[01:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=5475.34s)]
*  And they would rather, uh, spend time looking like men. [[01:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=5478.86s)]
*  Yeah, you can do whatever they want, man. [[01:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=5483.74s)]
*  I think if you become a woman, that's a benefit too. [[01:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=5486.139999999999s)]
*  You can actually become a Qatari citizen, right? [[01:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=5488.3s)]
*  Oh, that's a good point. [[01:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=5491.0199999999995s)]
*  The Qatari male citizen. [[01:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=5492.0599999999995s)]
*  So yeah, there's a loophole. [[01:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=5496.22s)]
*  That's a loophole. [[01:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=5497.26s)]
*  I like this, huh? [[01:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=5498.379999999999s)]
*  That's the dessert on the menu at Fuyo. [[01:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=5499.66s)]
*  It's Uncle Roger. [[01:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=5503.339999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=5504.379999999999s)]
*  The dessert is a secret path to Qatari citizenship. [[01:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=5505.5s)]
*  I like that. [[01:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=5508.7s)]
*  I like that. [[01:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=5509.5s)]
*  One last thing I want to talk to you about. [[01:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=5511.0199999999995s)]
*  Oh, you hear a lot about Taiwan and China, right? [[01:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=5513.259999999999s)]
*  Oh, oh yeah. [[01:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=5516.219999999999s)]
*  That's gotten some trouble there a few years ago. [[01:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=5517.66s)]
*  Just what? [[01:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=5520.94s)]
*  Talking about it or what are you? [[01:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=5521.339999999999s)]
*  I just had a joke. [[01:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=5522.379999999999s)]
*  If you search Uncle Roger vs China, I just did a bit. [[01:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=5523.179999999999s)]
*  It works all over the world. [[01:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=5527.9s)]
*  I did that bit in Bangkok and Toronto and LA. [[01:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=5529.26s)]
*  It works all over the world. [[01:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=5532.38s)]
*  So I kind of just want to gently roast Taiwan and gently roast China. [[01:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=5533.98s)]
*  And then right after that, all my Chinese social media accounts got banned. [[01:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=5537.66s)]
*  Really? [[01:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=5542.22s)]
*  Yeah, that was two years ago. [[01:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=5542.62s)]
*  Everything got wiped. [[01:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=5544.22s)]
*  If you search Uncle Roger on those Chinese social media apps, you'll find nothing. [[01:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=5545.18s)]
*  Even though I had like hundreds of thousands of followers before that. [[01:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=5549.42s)]
*  Really? [[01:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=5552.22s)]
*  And did you have... [[01:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=5552.86s)]
*  Oh yeah, wow. [[01:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=5554.62s)]
*  This has 40 million views, Uncle Roger. [[01:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=5555.099999999999s)]
*  Is it YouTube short? [[01:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=5558.3s)]
*  Those things go viral sometimes. [[01:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=5559.5s)]
*  Not this viral. [[01:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=5561.099999999999s)]
*  If you want. [[01:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=5561.98s)]
*  This is the most viral thing since COVID out of China. [[01:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=5562.54s)]
*  So China, China, okay. [[01:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=5565.0199999999995s)]
*  China, good country, good country. [[01:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=5567.0199999999995s)]
*  We have to say that now, correct? [[01:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=5568.94s)]
*  All their phone listening, all their phone listening. [[01:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=5577.18s)]
*  This nephew got Huawei phone, they all listening. [[01:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=5581.0199999999995s)]
*  All our phone tap into it. [[01:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=5584.3s)]
*  Long live presidency, long live presidency. [[01:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=5585.74s)]
*  Uncle Roger social credit score going up. [[01:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=5592.62s)]
*  Ennis and nephew from Taiwan. [[01:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=5597.42s)]
*  Not a real country, not a real... [[01:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=5601.34s)]
*  I hope one day you rejoin the motherland, one China. [[01:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=5608.3s)]
*  That's hilarious, dude. [[01:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=5611.66s)]
*  So is that a real feeling in Taiwan? [[01:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=5613.18s)]
*  Some of them feel like they should be part of China and some people don't? [[01:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=5615.18s)]
*  Yes, it's a very divided thing. [[01:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=5617.5s)]
*  But most people don't want to be part of China. [[01:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=5619.1s)]
*  Taiwan is a very interesting place. [[01:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=5622.06s)]
*  They do not use any of their Chinese social media apps. [[01:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=5623.58s)]
*  They use the Western ones. [[01:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=5626.14s)]
*  They use Facebook, Google, Instagram. [[01:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=5627.18s)]
*  Whereas in China, all those things are blocked. [[01:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=5630.06s)]
*  And you know, release this clip and then everything got wiped from China. [[01:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=5634.06s)]
*  Release this clip and then everything got wiped from Chinese socials. [[01:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=5638.7s)]
*  And then remember last year or a few months ago, everybody was getting on Red Note, this Chinese app. [[01:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=5641.82s)]
*  Yes. [[01:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=5646.78s)]
*  I tried re-registering for an account and the moment I uploaded my profile photo, [[01:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=5647.26s)]
*  that whole account got wiped again. [[01:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=5651.82s)]
*  No. [[01:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=5653.34s)]
*  So they have some sort of... [[01:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=5653.66s)]
*  I'm in some sort of database over there. [[01:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=5655.74s)]
*  So China is against you, you think? [[01:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=5658.54s)]
*  I probably can still visit if I get a visa, but I don't know if I want to risk it, you know? [[01:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=5661.5s)]
*  Yeah, and they just probably don't want you having a say in what China is like. [[01:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=5666.22s)]
*  They just don't want you having a voice in their country. [[01:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=5670.38s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=5672.46s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=5672.9400000000005s)]
*  But you know, it is what it is. [[01:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=5673.58s)]
*  Sometimes I think in the US, we take free speech for granted sometimes. [[01:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=5675.34s)]
*  And we forget that not all countries are like this. [[01:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=5679.58s)]
*  In the US, you say anything and the worst thing that happens is people get mad at you. [[01:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=5682.38s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=5687.58s)]
*  Right? [[01:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=5687.900000000001s)]
*  In the comments, whatever. [[01:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=5688.22s)]
*  But I don't know. [[01:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=5690.06s)]
*  I mean, these days, a lot of things get taken down even in the US. [[01:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=5691.18s)]
*  I feel like there's things you can't say. [[01:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=5694.7s)]
*  I think things get submerged, you know? [[01:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=5696.139999999999s)]
*  Or like a... [[01:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=5699.099999999999s)]
*  What is it called? [[01:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=5699.98s)]
*  Shadow Band? [[01:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=5700.7s)]
*  Shadow Band. [[01:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=5701.74s)]
*  True, true. [[01:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=5702.38s)]
*  But in a stand-up context, I feel we get more leeway. [[01:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=5703.099999999999s)]
*  Oh, that's a great point. [[01:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=5706.0599999999995s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=5707.099999999999s)]
*  In a stand-up context, we get so much freedom here. [[01:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=5707.34s)]
*  What is the biggest issue over there with Taiwan? [[01:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=5710.38s)]
*  Do you think that they'll remain free? [[01:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=5712.139999999999s)]
*  Because they make some of the most semiconductors in the world, right? [[01:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=5713.34s)]
*  TSMC, that company. [[01:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=5716.22s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=5717.9s)]
*  Taiwan Semiconductor. [[01:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=5718.139999999999s)]
*  Taiwan's... [[01:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=5719.0199999999995s)]
*  TSMC is the only reason China hasn't attacked Taiwan yet, you know? [[01:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=5719.66s)]
*  Wow. [[01:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=5723.099999999999s)]
*  That's too valuable. [[01:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=5723.9s)]
*  China and the United States both view Taiwan's dominance of the global tech supply chain [[01:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=5725.58s)]
*  as a national security risk. [[01:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=5729.82s)]
*  In response, they have tried to boost their own capacity to make chips they need. [[01:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=5731.42s)]
*  Yeah, I think they're trying to make more chips in the US. [[01:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=5735.66s)]
*  I know that that was something I saw a couple of weeks ago. [[01:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=5738.62s)]
*  NVIDIA's chief says US chip controls on China have backfired. [[01:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=5742.38s)]
*  Jensen Huang, who I'd love to talk to, the chip maker's top executive, [[01:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=5748.22s)]
*  from NVIDIA, they're the number one, they're the leader in chips, I believe, [[01:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=5754.3s)]
*  said the attempt to cut off the flow of advanced AI chips [[01:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=5757.58s)]
*  spurred Chinese companies to accelerate their development. [[01:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=5761.34s)]
*  Wow. [[01:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=5764.62s)]
*  Lawmakers in Washington have worked for years to limit China's access [[01:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=5765.9s)]
*  to the cutting edge computer chips needed for advanced artificial intelligence, [[01:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=5769.26s)]
*  particularly those made by NVIDIA, America's leading chip maker. [[01:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=5773.66s)]
*  And yeah, so these are the chips that are used for AI. [[01:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=5776.9400000000005s)]
*  And for some reason... [[01:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=5779.66s)]
*  AI weapons, you know, rockets. [[01:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=5780.38s)]
*  And for some reason, they make them the best over here. [[01:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=5783.82s)]
*  Taiwan has the best ones. [[01:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=5787.419999999999s)]
*  I think so. So far. [[01:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=5788.86s)]
*  But according to NVIDIA's chief executive Jensen Huang, [[01:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=5792.139999999999s)]
*  those regulations driven by economic and security concerns [[01:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=5795.5s)]
*  have only made Chinese tech companies stronger. [[01:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=5797.74s)]
*  Wow. [[01:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=5800.299999999999s)]
*  I mean, this is the type of thing somebody would go to war [[01:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=5802.0599999999995s)]
*  because whoever controls this is going to control a lot of things. [[01:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=5804.0599999999995s)]
*  I think this is going over my head, man. [[01:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=5806.86s)]
*  I just buy some Bitcoin and call it a day, you know? [[01:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=5808.299999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=5811.74s)]
*  Oh, me too. [[01:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=5812.94s)]
*  I'm just wondering what could happen to the people of Taiwan, right? [[01:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=5813.58s)]
*  I think that's my question is like, do people there live every day? [[01:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=5816.219999999999s)]
*  It must be weird there every day. [[01:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=5819.98s)]
*  You're going to a factory probably and creating these chips. [[01:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=5821.259999999999s)]
*  But knowing that the creation of these chips could have a semblance on [[01:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=5824.7s)]
*  if your country gets attacked or attempted to be controlled. [[01:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=5828.379999999999s)]
*  It has to be very strange, I feel like, you know? [[01:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=5833.339999999999s)]
*  Do you think that makes any sense or no? [[01:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=5836.219999999999s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[01:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=5837.5s)]
*  They have this maybe this added responsibility that [[01:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=5838.219999999999s)]
*  I better make a good fucking chip, otherwise China's going to ruin us. [[01:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=5840.54s)]
*  Right, or by keeping and make these. [[01:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=5844.06s)]
*  Like, what if we all decided we're not going to make them? [[01:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=5845.5s)]
*  Would they all just leave us alone and we could just be at peace? [[01:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=5846.94s)]
*  No, if Taiwan stops making them, China's going to attack it. [[01:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=5849.66s)]
*  China needs those chips right now. [[01:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=5854.78s)]
*  That's why they're not bombing the factory. [[01:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=5856.22s)]
*  Oh, I see. [[01:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=5857.98s)]
*  So they need them because they're supplying them. [[01:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=5858.7s)]
*  Yes, yes. [[01:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=5860.38s)]
*  So if you start making them, that'll be like, you know, [[01:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=5861.26s)]
*  if like a what do you call it, a bin man, a garbage truck person, you know? [[01:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=5863.1s)]
*  If they suck at your job, the whole country gets attacked. [[01:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=5867.98s)]
*  That would be stressful. [[01:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=5872.0599999999995s)]
*  Oh, it'd be the worst. [[01:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=5872.94s)]
*  It might actually work in and out. [[01:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=5873.9s)]
*  If you got the order wrong, Mexico's coming. [[01:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=5876.86s)]
*  This may be one of my last questions. [[01:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=5883.0199999999995s)]
*  Do you think, so a lot of goods from America are made in Asia, right? [[01:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=5884.299999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=5889.419999999999s)]
*  Do you think that, how do Asian people feel about that? [[01:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=5890.0599999999995s)]
*  Like, do they take a lot of pride that they make it? [[01:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=5893.66s)]
*  All these like things that go all over the world, [[01:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=5896.38s)]
*  do they just feel like it's just a means to an end and there's not a lot of pride in it? [[01:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=5898.54s)]
*  Like, what does that feel like? [[01:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=5902.78s)]
*  Do you feel like, especially probably to China, [[01:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=5903.9800000000005s)]
*  China is the place that gets labeled a lot as like making everything, you know? [[01:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=5905.66s)]
*  What have you heard or what like, what do people say about that? [[01:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=5910.54s)]
*  Does that make sense to you? [[01:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=5912.9400000000005s)]
*  Yeah, Malaysia makes quite a few things too, not as much as China for sure. [[01:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=5913.82s)]
*  I feel like to us, it's a job and it's a decent job. [[01:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=5918.06s)]
*  And without those manufacturing jobs, those people will have a shittier life, you know? [[01:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=5922.78s)]
*  So I think we like that those things, you know, globalization. [[01:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=5927.66s)]
*  I think when people talk about globalization, [[01:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=5932.86s)]
*  they see from the American perspective, yeah, you are losing jobs to the outside world. [[01:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=5934.38s)]
*  But on the flip side, we Asians are gaining some jobs that pay [[01:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=5938.86s)]
*  better than those jobs that existed prior, like, you know, [[01:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=5943.66s)]
*  working at a hawker stall selling noodles all day. [[01:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=5947.179999999999s)]
*  Manufacturing shoes probably pays them more. [[01:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=5949.9s)]
*  And I think this is a tough part, right? [[01:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=5952.459999999999s)]
*  Sometimes the economy, I feel, is a zero sum game, right? [[01:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=5954.219999999999s)]
*  Making a shoe is either a job in America or a job in Asia. [[01:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=5958.299999999999s)]
*  We only need so many shoes, right? [[01:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=5961.339999999999s)]
*  So, but we do think it is good. [[01:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=5963.179999999999s)]
*  It helps us elevate our quality of life. [[01:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=5965.98s)]
*  And hopefully in a few generations time, [[01:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=5968.94s)]
*  the Asians will have made more money and then maybe we won't have to do [[01:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=5971.82s)]
*  those menial manufacturing jobs anymore. [[01:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=5975.259999999999s)]
*  But for now, you know, it's the same thing where there was a news article [[01:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=5977.5s)]
*  came out recently, last year maybe, where in New York, [[01:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=5982.0599999999995s)]
*  they were starting to use, you know, like self-checkout lines. [[01:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=5985.5s)]
*  But then you had a FaceTime video calling someone from the Philippines, [[01:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=5989.179999999999s)]
*  the persons being the checkout, the cashier for you from the Philippines. [[01:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=5992.78s)]
*  Oh, so you had like a Zoom call with a checkout person. [[01:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=5997.0199999999995s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[01:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=6000.0599999999995s)]
*  So the whole internet hated it. [[01:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=6000.86s)]
*  But then from my perspective, it's like the person in the Philippines [[01:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=6003.5s)]
*  is probably getting paid way more than any job that she would have gotten. [[01:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=6006.7s)]
*  The person that they would have gone in the Philippines. [[01:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=6010.62s)]
*  And this is just a hard part of it's not an easy problem to solve, right? [[01:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=6013.34s)]
*  Global inequality. [[01:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=6017.0199999999995s)]
*  And I think it just takes time maybe. [[01:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=6018.62s)]
*  And just the hope is one day globalization will just even the playing field. [[01:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=6021.5s)]
*  Everybody can afford the things we need in life. [[01:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=6025.66s)]
*  Healthcare, a house, vehicle, those things. [[01:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=6029.0199999999995s)]
*  So that's my take on it. [[01:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=6032.46s)]
*  It's not very funny, but hopefully, yeah, that's the thing. [[01:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=6033.9s)]
*  Oh, Philippines, yeah. [[01:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=6037.0199999999995s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=6038.14s)]
*  But no, I think it's great. [[01:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=6039.0199999999995s)]
*  I just always wonder. [[01:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=6040.22s)]
*  I always think like, oh yeah, it's just like how I look at it from my perspective as an American. [[01:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=6041.26s)]
*  I never think like, what do these people feel about it? [[01:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=6044.9400000000005s)]
*  Like, you know. [[01:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=6046.780000000001s)]
*  We probably like it to the Filipino person. [[01:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=6048.14s)]
*  For sure. [[01:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=6051.26s)]
*  He's just working from home, putting a fake Zoom background. [[01:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=6051.740000000001s)]
*  Nothing, huh? [[01:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=6054.620000000001s)]
*  Just clocking in. [[01:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=6055.02s)]
*  Cooking. [[01:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=6056.14s)]
*  Yeah, not even cooking. [[01:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=6056.620000000001s)]
*  She's just checking out the cashier. [[01:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=6057.660000000001s)]
*  Yeah, but she can be cooking at the same time. [[01:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=6059.42s)]
*  Yeah, she can be cooking for her kids. [[01:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=6060.860000000001s)]
*  She will be home for her kids. [[01:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=6062.54s)]
*  Because in Asia, people work long hours, man. [[01:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=6064.22s)]
*  There's some, you know. [[01:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=6066.54s)]
*  In Malaysia, we have domestic helpers sometimes who are coming from Indonesia. [[01:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=6068.14s)]
*  And they live with us, right? [[01:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=6072.22s)]
*  So they are just gone from their families three years at a time. [[01:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=6074.22s)]
*  And they get one day off a week maybe, but they get to call their families. [[01:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=6078.22s)]
*  So this Filipino job, this virtual cashier job, that's like the best job. [[01:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=6083.42s)]
*  That's working remotely, man. [[01:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=6089.58s)]
*  That's being a digital nomad for them. [[01:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=6090.780000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I like that. [[01:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=6092.780000000001s)]
*  They're doing that in Bali, you know. [[01:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=6093.660000000001s)]
*  I like that shit. [[01:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=6095.26s)]
*  I like that shit. [[01:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=6096.46s)]
*  But what about this? [[01:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=6097.66s)]
*  So, and I'll say this. [[01:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=6098.38s)]
*  Round of applause for Filipinos. [[01:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=6099.9800000000005s)]
*  I want to say that, right? [[01:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=6101.26s)]
*  Yes. [[01:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=6102.14s)]
*  Jokoi. [[01:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=6103.66s)]
*  Doing good job. [[01:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=6104.54s)]
*  Jokoi did good. [[01:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=6105.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=6105.740000000001s)]
*  Doing good job. [[01:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=6105.900000000001s)]
*  But I want to say Filipinos, it's funny because they're usually the last people you see before [[01:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=6107.1s)]
*  you die because a lot of them work in hospice care. [[01:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=6113.5s)]
*  That's true. [[01:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=6116.54s)]
*  You know? [[01:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=6117.26s)]
*  I was wondering where this conversation was going. [[01:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=6117.900000000001s)]
*  Oh yeah, it's going... [[01:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=6120.22s)]
*  And you just see the light and then there's a Filipino person. [[01:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=6121.34s)]
*  It's just like, well, the light is a little bit... [[01:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=6123.9800000000005s)]
*  Blocking the light. [[01:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=6125.1s)]
*  It's a little bit blocked here by like one Filipino person with like a stethoscope, you know? [[01:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=6126.06s)]
*  Yeah, it's Jokoi blocking the light. [[01:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=6129.740000000001s)]
*  But they often have a lot of the same name, you know, David. [[01:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=6133.1s)]
*  David. [[01:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=6136.06s)]
*  David. [[01:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dyoC_HZsrs&t=6138.14s)]
