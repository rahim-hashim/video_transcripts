*  Candice, which you can find releasing every week. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=35.92s)]
*  I'm grateful for her time. Today's guest is Candice Owen. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=39.92s)]
*  Anyway, is this mic on her okay? [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=58.56s)]
*  We're good. Do I sound good? [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=64.2s)]
*  Great. I look perfect. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=66.2s)]
*  Oh, dang. Well, I'm not going to tell you that. You're obviously a taken woman. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=68.2s)]
*  Are you hot or cold? Do you feel like? [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=72.2s)]
*  No, I only run one way because I'm black. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=75.4s)]
*  I was going to ask because you're pregnant. Are you hot or cold? [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=78.4s)]
*  This is like a repeat conversation. First off, there's the women. We always run cold. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=85.24000000000001s)]
*  Oh, yes. I've heard that. My friend Neil Brinan is a comedian. He has a bunch of jokes about it. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=91.24000000000001s)]
*  Yeah. I'm a woman and I'm black, so I naturally like the heat. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=95.24000000000001s)]
*  Oh, so black women prefer to be warmer? [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=98.24000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, of course. We like the heat. Our natural habitat is warm. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=100.24000000000001s)]
*  That's a good point. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=104.24000000000001s)]
*  My family's Caribbean, so the warmth feels great. When I'm boiling hot, the team, my team of guys, [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=105.24000000000001s)]
*  they always want the air on, so it's freezing cold in here. I have to tell them, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=111.08s)]
*  some of you are Nordic. It doesn't work. I have a redhead on my team and I'm like, [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=114.08s)]
*  Skylar, you're from the Nordic countries. That's why you feel this way. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=119.08s)]
*  I think that where you're from takes a lot of your life or where your family would [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=123.08s)]
*  originally be from. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=127.08s)]
*  Sometimes I don't think about that. It would be great if your AC or whatever had a Caribbean [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=128.07999999999998s)]
*  setting or whatever and you could have set that and suddenly some great music came out. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=132.07999999999998s)]
*  It's perfect. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=138.92000000000002s)]
*  And then some guys trying to get you to gamble offshore. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=140.92000000000002s)]
*  Suddenly you're like, what temperature is this? That would be so crazy. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=142.92000000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=146.92000000000002s)]
*  They should have, yeah, where are all the cool settings for the HVAC? [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=147.92000000000002s)]
*  I absolutely love the heat, so I cannot stay in the winter. I can't stay in the cold weather, [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=151.92000000000002s)]
*  the gray weather. Even there's a difference if in this, I think actually gets scientific. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=156.92000000000002s)]
*  I didn't need the science of it, but it does get scientific. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=160.92000000000002s)]
*  But if you're from those countries, like if I'm in the UK, because my husband's English, [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=163.92000000000002s)]
*  just the gray weather, I can't live like this. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=167.76s)]
*  Yeah, it's a bunch of ee-ores over there. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=170.76s)]
*  Where is the sun? And my husband just fine. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=172.76s)]
*  He can be like productive, like super productive if it's like 12 days of gray and rain. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=175.76s)]
*  He almost loves it. He just wants to retreat to his library. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=180.76s)]
*  Oh yeah. I think all British people are always just writing war letters and stuff. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=183.76s)]
*  That's how I kind of always envision them. They're always just looking out the window [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=187.76s)]
*  and writing about the war to each other. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=190.76s)]
*  That's what my husband does all day. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=192.76s)]
*  And then even Paddington Bear, their bear has a coat. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=194.6s)]
*  He's not even, like our bears are naked. You know what I'm saying? [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=197.6s)]
*  I'm not saying that that's the way to do it, but if you bring up an American Teddy Bear real quick. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=200.6s)]
*  Let me see this topless bastard. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=205.6s)]
*  Paddington Bear is proper. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=208.6s)]
*  Yeah, now some of these are obviously some pretty right-wing bears. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=211.6s)]
*  Bring up a politically neutral Teddy Bear. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=214.6s)]
*  But they are. They're always like not well dressed. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=217.6s)]
*  We don't really wear a lot of clothes in America in general. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=219.6s)]
*  And especially as you come down to the South. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=223.44s)]
*  Because then there's England and there's New England. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=225.44s)]
*  So I'm from Connecticut, so there's a lot of similarity. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=228.44s)]
*  And then the more that you drift south, you're kind of in a different country. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=230.44s)]
*  Oh, that's a good point. I never even think about that. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=233.44s)]
*  Oh yeah, because if you see some people cook and some of the stuff I've seen them cook, [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=236.44s)]
*  you would call the police in some communities, you know? [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=239.44s)]
*  But in other communities, you're just sharpening your silverware. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=242.44s)]
*  So yeah, I agree that that's interesting. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=245.44s)]
*  But yeah, they should have definitely some better settings on the A.C. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=247.44s)]
*  If they had Caribbean, like you turn that bitch, set that bitch to plantains or whatever. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=252.28s)]
*  Like I would love that. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=255.28s)]
*  I would absolutely love it. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=256.28s)]
*  You are pregnant now. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=258.28s)]
*  I've been pregnant for four years actually. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=260.28s)]
*  So I think now people are kind of saying to me, still or again, when they see me. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=262.28s)]
*  Are you still pregnant or are you pregnant again? [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=267.28s)]
*  So I'm not sure which one, but this is my fourth kid. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=269.28s)]
*  And I've had a child every year. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=272.28s)]
*  It's kind of crazy. This is like a lifestyle now for me. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=274.28s)]
*  Pregnancy is a lifestyle. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=277.28s)]
*  Are there good dreams when you're pregnant? [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=280.11999999999995s)]
*  That's one thing, because you're kind of dreaming for two. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=282.11999999999995s)]
*  I feel like it is almost like being at the sphere or whatever. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=284.11999999999995s)]
*  That's what I would wonder. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=286.11999999999995s)]
*  You get some really weird dreams when you're pregnant and also some very precise dreams [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=287.11999999999995s)]
*  that end up coming true. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=293.11999999999995s)]
*  Totally weird. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=295.11999999999995s)]
*  I mean, I woke up and had such a crystal clear dream. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=296.11999999999995s)]
*  My last pregnancy, my EP was trying to get pregnant. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=299.11999999999995s)]
*  And EP means executive producer? [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=303.11999999999995s)]
*  Yeah, my former executive producer. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=304.11999999999995s)]
*  And I had a crystal, like her son visited me. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=306.96s)]
*  And it was before she knew she was pregnant. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=308.96s)]
*  And I said to her, you're having a little boy. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=311.96s)]
*  Like you're pregnant. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=314.96s)]
*  And she was like, I'm not pregnant. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=315.96s)]
*  And then she went back. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=316.96s)]
*  Or somebody shot an episode of The Ring in your womb, maybe. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=317.96s)]
*  One or the other. That sounds wild. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=320.96s)]
*  And then they got pregnant. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=322.96s)]
*  She found out she was pregnant. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=323.96s)]
*  And then she went back because I texted her and it was like the day of conception. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=324.96s)]
*  And my sisters did the same exact thing to me when they were pregnant. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=328.96s)]
*  So there's some weird pregnancy dreams that happen. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=331.96s)]
*  I go with them. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=334.96s)]
*  And I'm like, I want to go for a vivid pregnancy dream. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=336.79999999999995s)]
*  I'm like that's happening. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=338.79999999999995s)]
*  Yeah, that's cool. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=339.79999999999995s)]
*  Yeah. Because you would think that the spirit would be able to come visit you before it [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=341.79999999999995s)]
*  showed up, right? [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=344.79999999999995s)]
*  Because this is just kind of the physical inclination of a spirit, right? [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=345.79999999999995s)]
*  Being alive on Earth. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=349.79999999999995s)]
*  And so it would make sense that the spirit got to come and kind of loiter a little bit [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=350.79999999999995s)]
*  or visit friends like friends of whoever it was going to occupy, you know? [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=356.0s)]
*  If I think about dreams too hard, it freaks me out. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=360.0s)]
*  It just scares me. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=363.0s)]
*  Genuinely, I'm going, what's real, what's not, [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=365.24s)]
*  is this inception, because you are so certain [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=367.72s)]
*  in a moment of deja vu that you've been there, [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=371.12s)]
*  you've seen that person, you've met that person, [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=373.0s)]
*  and yet you haven't in your waking world. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=375.6s)]
*  So us not having, just humans not having an answer [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=379.04s)]
*  to deja vu is one of those lingering things [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=383.76s)]
*  that in the back of my mind, if I think too much about it, [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=385.88s)]
*  I just get freaked out. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=388.16s)]
*  Yeah, I had a guest on recently, this guy, R.A. Shafir, [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=389.52s)]
*  and we had the strongest moment of deja vu I'd ever had, [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=392.12s)]
*  and I almost just grabbed him, and I was like, [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=394.47999999999996s)]
*  you've been here. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=396.35999999999996s)]
*  Yeah, and maybe sometimes you had an enemy or a friend, [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=397.71999999999997s)]
*  or you just know someone. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=400.96s)]
*  Well, it was like, I knew you, I was like, [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=402.2s)]
*  we've done this before, and I almost felt like he knew it, [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=403.44s)]
*  and he was like, this bastard is, this dude, [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=405.56s)]
*  and I was like, tell me why you came before. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=409.44s)]
*  Yeah, I know you from another life. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=411.4s)]
*  What was our beef? [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=414.44s)]
*  Like, dude, yeah, tell me what you're fucking doing here, [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=415.44s)]
*  tell me who you're working for. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=418.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=419.32s)]

*  that are out of your body right now, [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=423.04s)]
*  is that what you're saying? [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=424.88000000000005s)]
*  Out of my body, yeah, three, three, [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=425.72s)]
*  we did three under three, my eldest just turned four, [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=427.08000000000004s)]
*  and so, yeah, we're on another, [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=429.84000000000003s)]
*  we are on another planet right now in my house, [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=431.40000000000003s)]
*  like the toddlers are running things, they're running things. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=433.08000000000004s)]
*  They are. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=435.36s)]
*  And I'm scared of them. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=436.20000000000005s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=437.04s)]
*  And I feel comfortable saying that here. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=437.88s)]
*  I wouldn't tell them that, I act tough. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=438.92s)]
*  No, you gotta, yeah, I think you go away [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=441.0s)]
*  from the house of screaming. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=442.76000000000005s)]
*  We don't let them know we're outnumbered, [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=443.6s)]
*  you know, because they're just kinda learning to count. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=444.64000000000004s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=446.16s)]
*  But we are fully outnumbered. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=447.0s)]
*  You only teach them to count to two? [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=448.36s)]
*  Before they start making sense [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=450.79999999999995s)]
*  and having little toddler meetings, [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=452.44s)]

*  Oh, yeah, I forgot, I didn't see, [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=459.96s)]
*  it's interesting that you would see Rugrats [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=461.76s)]
*  as like a, like a Psy-op idea of all of like babies [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=463.68s)]
*  kind of like coagulating and forming [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=467.84s)]
*  like a Lord of the Flies. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=470.47999999999996s)]
*  Tommy had a screwdriver at all times. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=471.56s)]
*  Good point. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=474.59999999999997s)]
*  He was a moral person, but he had a screwdriver [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=475.44s)]
*  at all times in his, yeah, there's two of them. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=476.79999999999995s)]
*  Oh, that diaper was thick too. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=479.32s)]
*  And I'll say this, this is a little girl on the right. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=481.2s)]
*  She looks like, and this guy is also a very handsome guy, [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=485.03999999999996s)]
*  in this photo, she looks like Anthony Smith, [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=489.76s)]
*  who is a, one of the greatest UFC fighters. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=491.79999999999995s)]
*  Bring up a photo of Anthony Smith as well [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=494.47999999999996s)]
*  on a separate, I, separate, and I shouldn't say that [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=496.23999999999995s)]
*  because she's gonna get upset. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=499.03999999999996s)]
*  Yeah, and she's not the one to upset, [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=500.35999999999996s)]
*  so you just be very careful here [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=502.0s)]
*  before she Anthony Smiths you. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=503.88s)]
*  Okay, okay, yeah, nevermind. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=505.03999999999996s)]
*  Oh, you have a beautiful family. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=507.08s)]
*  Are you able to take a vacation? [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=509.67999999999995s)]
*  Were you able to take any vacations recently or anything? [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=511.96s)]
*  Yeah, we went, just got back, I'm saying just got back, [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=513.72s)]
*  but that's how it feels like time is flying, [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=516.52s)]
*  but we spent all of December overseas. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=517.9599999999999s)]
*  So we spent a lot of time in England [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=520.12s)]
*  because we just wanna spend time with my husband's family [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=522.0799999999999s)]
*  and then we popped over to Switzerland for a ski trip, [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=524.24s)]
*  which was awesome. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=526.8399999999999s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah, so, and I had a lot of these thoughts [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=527.68s)]
*  like when we were walking through Zermatt, [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=530.52s)]
*  and I love Switzerland, it's a beautiful country, [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=532.1999999999999s)]
*  but you know, you get the tour [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=534.3199999999999s)]
*  and you're way up in the mountains [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=535.4s)]
*  and they figured out how to just live in the mountains [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=536.8s)]
*  and you get these moments where you're just like, [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=539.3599999999999s)]
*  there were no black people here when this was built [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=541.68s)]
*  because there's no way we would even like, [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=543.56s)]
*  it's so cold that we would be like, [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=545.0799999999999s)]
*  let's see if we can get a sleigh up here [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=547.4399999999999s)]
*  and try to build roads. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=549.56s)]
*  Like it's just, and it's amazing, like Zermatt, [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=551.0s)]
*  like look at that, it's the most beautiful town [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=552.9599999999999s)]
*  and they figured out how to make everything happen [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=555.0799999999999s)]
*  on tiny little roads and with taxis going up and in between. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=557.28s)]
*  Wow, that's Zurich? [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=560.8399999999999s)]
*  That is Zermatt. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=562.4399999999999s)]
*  Zermatt. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=563.3599999999999s)]
*  Yeah, have you been to Switzerland? [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=564.1999999999999s)]
*  You always hear about the Swiss Alps, is this it? [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=565.56s)]
*  It's beautiful. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=567.56s)]
*  Wow. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=568.4s)]
*  Yeah, Switzerland is truly a beautiful, beautiful country [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=569.24s)]
*  and I love the mountains, I will say that. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=571.76s)]
*  I'm a mountain girl, I do not love, [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=573.1999999999999s)]
*  I actually kind of hate beaches. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=575.16s)]
*  Really? [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=576.64s)]
*  I have an issue with sand. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=577.48s)]
*  I have beef with sand. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=578.52s)]
*  Yeah, it just gets everywhere. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=580.0799999999999s)]
*  I don't know, it's drying and it gets everywhere [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=581.6s)]
*  and I just don't like it. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=584.48s)]
*  Yeah, I wonder how I feel about it. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=585.8399999999999s)]
*  Speaking of those villages actually, [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=588.3199999999999s)]
*  yeah, I haven't been there, [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=589.64s)]
*  but my friend when I was a kid, [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=591.0s)]
*  he won his family football pool or whatever [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=592.8s)]
*  for the NCAA football, like whenever they have the bowl games [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=595.52s)]
*  and his mom coerced him into buying a Switzerland village [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=600.04s)]
*  or whatever that they could put on their table at home. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=605.24s)]
*  So he came into some money, he came in, [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=607.56s)]
*  it was almost like, I think it was like 1,100. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=609.88s)]
*  He came into some money and so then two weeks later, [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=612.56s)]
*  we're like, dude, what are you gonna do with the money? [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=615.52s)]
*  And he had a freaking Christmas village at his house. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=616.76s)]
*  Like a dollhouse. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=620.4799999999999s)]
*  Or just like, you know those villages people get [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=621.68s)]
*  and it's like Switzerland and his was Switzerland, [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=623.56s)]
*  but he was furious about it. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=625.88s)]
*  Anyway, I don't know why I told you that story, [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=628.6s)]
*  but that sounds like a beautiful trip. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=629.88s)]
*  I would like to go to Switzerland. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=631.84s)]
*  I spent a little bit of time in France [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=633.3199999999999s)]
*  and then I was in London recently [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=635.4s)]
*  and actually really enjoyed it. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=636.8s)]
*  I hadn't enjoyed it as much before, [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=638.72s)]
*  but I think this time I noticed that the people over there, [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=640.04s)]
*  they seem to have like, or at least the women, [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=643.4s)]
*  some of the women over there are more, [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=646.16s)]
*  or maybe this is, I don't wanna say women, [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=649.12s)]
*  but there's more going on than just like, [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=651.04s)]
*  likes on social media. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=653.7199999999999s)]
*  There are people who seem to have a bit more to them [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=654.88s)]
*  as individuals, but that could just be the people [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=657.36s)]
*  I was talking to. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=659.16s)]
*  Yeah, I absolutely love London. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=660.0s)]
*  It's like a second home [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=661.3199999999999s)]
*  and there is a totally different culture. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=662.1999999999999s)]
*  And if you're one of those people [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=664.88s)]
*  that I like to be uncomfortable, [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=665.76s)]
*  so I like to go somewhere where I know absolutely nothing [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=667.1999999999999s)]
*  and be uncomfortable and learn. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=669.1999999999999s)]
*  And a lot of people don't like that. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=670.36s)]
*  They instantly become judgmental [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=671.76s)]
*  and kind of resort to stereotypes of, [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=673.92s)]
*  oh, well, the English and the king and the queen [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=675.92s)]
*  and whatever it is that's kind of programmed into you, [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=678.9599999999999s)]
*  I am like the exact opposite person. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=681.16s)]
*  I absolutely love their culture. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=683.24s)]
*  I love that there's so many rules. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=685.1999999999999s)]
*  There's no reason for rules, but they have rules. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=686.9599999999999s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=689.0799999999999s)]
*  I love that they wear hats still to weddings, [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=690.52s)]
*  like fascinators rather, which I learned. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=693.8s)]
*  I learned that they're called fascinators, not hats. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=696.16s)]
*  A fascinator's a hat? [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=697.92s)]
*  Yes, it's called the, [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=698.76s)]
*  like the ones you wear to the wedding, [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=699.5999999999999s)]
*  those are called fascinators, not hats. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=701.0799999999999s)]
*  And there is a difference. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=702.56s)]
*  Bring it up, a fascinator. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=703.4s)]
*  Yeah, and he's not, I wanna see him spell it too, [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=705.1999999999999s)]
*  because that's even. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=707.6s)]
*  He sounds like a gay superhero kind of. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=708.72s)]
*  That's how I feel. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=710.6s)]
*  It does. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=711.52s)]
*  Oh shit, and it's just a dude that shows up [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=714.0400000000001s)]
*  and it's like, he doesn't have any specific powers [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=716.2s)]
*  like any of the other superheroes. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=718.5600000000001s)]
*  He's just like more like exciting. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=719.8000000000001s)]
*  He's like, oh shit, there's fascinators, [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=721.16s)]
*  Randy or whatever. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=723.6s)]
*  Dude, all my gay friends with- [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=725.08s)]
*  That's a fascinator. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=726.28s)]
*  Oh, so it's a female hat. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=727.52s)]
*  Yeah, and so they still wear hats to weddings, [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=729.96s)]
*  and I love it. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=733.1600000000001s)]
*  So when I go to weddings now, [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=733.98s)]
*  I wear hats. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=736.0s)]
*  Well, I call them hats just for Americans to understand, [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=737.44s)]
*  but fascinators. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=740.4000000000001s)]
*  And to shop for fascinators is really fun. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=741.6800000000001s)]
*  It's actually, I feel like this, [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=744.5600000000001s)]
*  you would be hilarious shopping for a fascinator, [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=746.24s)]
*  because you can just find one [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=749.4000000000001s)]
*  that speaks to your character. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=750.2800000000001s)]
*  But we've given up that. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=752.8000000000001s)]
*  I love gloves, hats. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=753.84s)]
*  When you see someone wearing a lot of, [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=756.2800000000001s)]
*  like just hats, gloves, and what's the other thing [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=759.8000000000001s)]
*  that I like, like your outfit to look complete, [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=762.12s)]
*  you just look more complete, you know what I mean? [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=764.08s)]
*  Oh yeah, there's more, they look a little bit more [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=766.64s)]
*  gift wrapped over there. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=770.04s)]
*  Whereas here, if it's hats and gloves, [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=771.76s)]
*  it's burglary usually, I feel like. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=773.88s)]
*  So it's just like America's kinda like- [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=776.16s)]
*  The best dressed people in America are burglars, [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=777.9599999999999s)]
*  if we're being honest. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=779.7199999999999s)]
*  We have so many burglars now, [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=780.56s)]
*  there should be a contest, I feel like. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=781.68s)]
*  We've definitely come a long way from the Beagle Boys. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=784.4799999999999s)]
*  Bring those guys up from DuckTales. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=786.4s)]
*  Those guys were horribly dressed. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=788.4799999999999s)]
*  DuckTales, you strike me as someone [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=791.3599999999999s)]
*  who watched the DuckTales. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=793.8399999999999s)]
*  We had to, this was our babysitter. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=795.28s)]
*  I was like, Mom, do we have a babysitter? [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=796.4s)]
*  She's like, yeah, the Beagle Boys. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=797.76s)]
*  Don't you watch DuckTales every day? [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=799.48s)]
*  I'm like, that's a television program. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=800.96s)]
*  Scrooge McDuck, this is a throwback. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=803.0s)]
*  Yeah, I remember it, but it wasn't my number one show, [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=806.0s)]
*  for sure, like I really loved Doug Funny. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=808.8s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=811.72s)]
*  He was really like a cool guy. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=812.5600000000001s)]
*  We also ended up marrying a white guy too, [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=813.92s)]
*  so I think that all checks out. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=815.76s)]
*  Do you think Doug Funny though? [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=817.08s)]
*  He wasn't, I mean, I thought Roger was cooler, [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=818.44s)]
*  and he was blue guy. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=820.8s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=822.0s)]
*  He was a blue guy, Roger. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=823.64s)]
*  Oh no, green. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=824.84s)]
*  Was he green? Oh, Roger. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=826.48s)]
*  They could've changed him. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=828.24s)]
*  Yeah, they probably changed him. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=829.4s)]
*  Yeah, people always say he looks [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=830.36s)]
*  like Macklemore a little bit too. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=831.2s)]
*  Do you know that thing, what is the term for, [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=832.64s)]
*  it's gonna escape me at the moment, [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=835.48s)]
*  but where you go back and you are so certain [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=836.8000000000001s)]
*  that something was drawn a certain way, [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=839.36s)]
*  the Mandela effect, that really creeps me out too. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=841.6s)]
*  Do you know what I'm talking about? [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=845.4s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, you'll be like, no, it was exactly like this, [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=846.2800000000001s)]
*  and then it wasn't. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=848.64s)]
*  Right, and I'm certain it was, like the Bernstein Bears. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=850.2800000000001s)]
*  Yeah, that's the big one people talk about a lot. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=854.52s)]
*  Yeah, that freaks me out. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=856.12s)]
*  Remember many people, let me see, [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=857.24s)]
*  the Mandela effect is when a group of people [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=858.72s)]
*  misremember something, such as a brand name or event. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=860.5600000000001s)]
*  Some examples include, many people remember that. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=864.16s)]
*  Yes, Fruit of the Loom had a cornucopia. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=866.24s)]
*  I agree. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=869.2s)]
*  And they're saying it doesn't now. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=870.08s)]
*  So who's doing it, who's deleting it, [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=871.44s)]
*  who's deleting the files of our memories, [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=873.0s)]
*  because I am certain Fruit of the Loom had a cornucopia. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=875.04s)]
*  Me too, Little Cornucopia, Little Fruit, Little Loom. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=878.44s)]
*  Or you brought the loom, I don't know what a loom is. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=882.5600000000001s)]
*  I don't wanna. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=884.48s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=885.2800000000001s)]
*  But this is the kind of stuff where they just are deleting, [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=886.5200000000001s)]
*  they're deleting files now, so someone is just at the CIA [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=889.12s)]
*  just like hitting the delete button, [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=891.6400000000001s)]
*  and then they just pretend it didn't happen. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=892.8800000000001s)]
*  I wouldn't be surprised. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=894.72s)]
*  I'll have one for you, Pikachu. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=895.5600000000001s)]
*  Okay. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=897.44s)]
*  Was there, describe his tail. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=898.2800000000001s)]
*  Pikachu's short, let me think of him. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=901.44s)]
*  Oh God, he's nasty. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=906.6800000000001s)]
*  He had short little tail, kind of like a, [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=908.5200000000001s)]
*  just like a little, like a isosceles triangle [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=912.24s)]
*  kind of coming off of him. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=916.24s)]
*  But what color was it? [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=917.08s)]
*  His tail was yellow. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=918.52s)]
*  You don't remember anything on it? [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=919.88s)]
*  Maybe it had a little ball at the end or something? [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=922.48s)]
*  Like a little black ball at the end? [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=924.16s)]
*  Yes, there was no black little thing at the end of it. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=926.48s)]
*  Now they're saying Pikachu never had that. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=930.3199999999999s)]
*  That stresses me out. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=932.56s)]
*  There was a black ball at the end, [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=934.28s)]
*  the one on the left is correct, [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=935.84s)]
*  and they're saying the black ball never existed. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=937.64s)]
*  So someone's just deleting the files. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=939.76s)]
*  They're deleting the files. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=941.4s)]
*  Well, I wouldn't be, it's like, [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=942.24s)]
*  it feels like that a lot of times. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=944.6s)]
*  And we get so like compromised in our brains [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=946.52s)]
*  because we only have so much bandwidth, right? [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=949.12s)]
*  Like we think we have this immense amount of bandwidth, [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=951.52s)]
*  but we really don't. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=953.28s)]
*  And so it's like, once your files are kind of filled, [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=954.12s)]
*  it's like, that's all you have. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=956.84s)]
*  Yeah, are you saying we're getting old? [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=958.6s)]
*  Yeah, I think that doesn't help, you know? [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=960.36s)]
*  Candace Owens, thanks for hanging out with me today. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=962.16s)]
*  I appreciate it, it's nice to see you. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=964.68s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=966.56s)]
*  Yeah, I think you're a great person. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=967.4s)]
*  I think you're like such a brave, [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=969.4s)]
*  you're like veracity, you're like fearless, you know? [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=972.44s)]
*  And you're like, you're fear, [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=976.0s)]
*  I don't think anybody couldn't say those things about you. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=979.48s)]
*  Do you ever like get worried for your own safety [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=982.16s)]
*  or anything these days? [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=986.32s)]
*  Does that happen to you? [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=987.16s)]
*  I really don't, and it's definitely a consideration, [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=988.88s)]
*  like because people are constantly saying to me, [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=992.04s)]
*  worry about your safety, get security. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=994.48s)]
*  But I kind of think security is one of these things [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=996.6s)]
*  that you get for your own vanity, [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=998.4s)]
*  because my perspective is they shot JFK [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=999.68s)]
*  in a moving vehicle, [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1002.92s)]
*  he's supposed to be the most secure person [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1003.88s)]
*  in the United States, and so, [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1006.24s)]
*  when you see people walking around and they've got security, [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1007.68s)]
*  I'm like, okay, maybe it makes you feel good, [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1010.0s)]
*  but at the end of the day, it's in God's hands, so. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1011.92s)]
*  Yeah, it's just, yeah, they can easily catch me [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1015.4s)]
*  outside of an Eddie Bauer or something, you know? [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1017.3199999999999s)]
*  That's what I mean. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1018.92s)]
*  In a heartbeat, that won't be. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1019.76s)]
*  Won't be that difficult, so. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1021.24s)]
*  I am extremely realistic about things like that. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1022.8s)]
*  And I also think that there's safety in people [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1026.04s)]
*  even saying to watch your safety, [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1028.8s)]
*  like if people are looking out for you [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1030.48s)]
*  and those sorts of things. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1032.12s)]
*  I think we live in a different world now with social media [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1033.56s)]
*  and people that are way more invested in individuals, [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1035.8s)]
*  and the things that were able to happen, [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1039.04s)]
*  like in the 60s, couldn't really happen today [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1040.8s)]
*  without causing a major firestorm, [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1042.76s)]
*  so I try not to think about that too much. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1045.24s)]
*  I worry more about the, just the privacy [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1046.68s)]
*  as a parent to children. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1050.0s)]
*  That would be, that's the one area, [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1051.84s)]
*  because I've seen some clips online [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1054.24s)]
*  of people getting wackadoodle, [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1055.96s)]
*  whether you're talking left or right, [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1058.8400000000001s)]
*  some people can just get way too crazy [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1060.1200000000001s)]
*  and way too comfortable and will go up to someone [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1062.44s)]
*  when they're with their kids. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1065.0800000000002s)]
*  Like I've seen a clip of someone, it was years ago, [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1066.6000000000001s)]
*  that was chastising Tucker Carlson, [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1070.04s)]
*  like he was, I think he was in Jackson Hole, [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1071.96s)]
*  like he was in Wyoming, where just nothing happens in Wyoming. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1075.0s)]
*  Oh, I think I remember this clip maybe. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1078.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1079.92s)]
*  But he was with his children? [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1080.76s)]
*  He was with his children, and. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1081.6000000000001s)]
*  That's so bizarre, because then the kid is witnessing, [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1083.72s)]
*  the kid is like, what's even going on? [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1085.76s)]
*  Right, they have no idea who I am, [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1087.48s)]
*  my kids have no idea who I am. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1089.0s)]
*  Yeah, he's like, I thought my dad sold nicotine pouches, [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1090.44s)]
*  he's a, he's a. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1092.92s)]
*  They think I make breakfast, do laundry, [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1095.28s)]
*  you know what I mean? [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1097.8400000000001s)]
*  So if someone comes up and they start screaming, [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1098.68s)]
*  they're likely to join in, you know? [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1100.96s)]
*  We've got her outnumbered, but that sort of a thing, [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1104.5600000000002s)]
*  traumatizing a child for the sake of your political beliefs, [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1108.0800000000002s)]
*  and I worry in those scenarios, [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1111.2s)]
*  just because I don't trust myself not to fly off with a handle, [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1112.84s)]
*  you know, because there's a natural bare instinct [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1115.6799999999998s)]
*  that mothers have. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1118.1999999999998s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1119.04s)]
*  And it's like, stay away from the cubs, [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1119.8799999999999s)]
*  stay away from the cubs. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1120.84s)]
*  So that's, I think, my only daily consideration. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1121.6799999999998s)]
*  Hmm. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1124.28s)]
*  I saw, oh, is this the clip? [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1125.72s)]
*  Is this him talking about it? [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1128.24s)]
*  It's hard to have lunch at the Four Seasons in Jackson [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1129.28s)]
*  during the winter, because there's some private equity wife [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1133.08s)]
*  who's going to scream at you on your way to the men's room, [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1135.48s)]
*  because that world hates you. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1137.1599999999999s)]
*  He happens to live in Jackson, Wyoming, so, [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1139.48s)]
*  and I go there, you know, to ski and to fish. [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1141.56s)]
*  And I have for a very long time. [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1144.04s)]
*  And I always say to him, I can't go anymore, [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1145.44s)]
*  because I yelled at at lunch over my elk chili, [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1147.96s)]
*  or in the lift line or whatever, or at the West Side Market. [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1151.3999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, people can get a little bit crazy. [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1154.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1156.6799999999998s)]
*  So that's kind of your biggest concern. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1157.6399999999999s)]
*  Do you, did you see that Trump signed [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1159.52s)]
*  that executive order for the healthcare? [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1162.72s)]
*  Which one? [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1165.1599999999999s)]
*  Oh, the one that he recently signed, that was just going... [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1166.0s)]
*  Yeah, I think it was like two days ago. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1168.36s)]
*  Can you bring that up? [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1169.6s)]
*  About, yeah, price transparency, yes. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1172.1999999999998s)]
*  I did see this. [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1173.84s)]
*  And it's amazing, because I've been kind of one of these [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1174.76s)]
*  people that's been beating the drum on the health stuff. [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1178.3999999999999s)]
*  Before it was cool, like I was called anti-vax and whatever, [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1180.32s)]
*  irresponsible, stupid, you're going to kill your kids, [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1184.08s)]
*  because polio is going to come back, you know, [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1186.4799999999998s)]
*  all the good things people say on the internet. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1188.32s)]
*  And it's so great to see that something that [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1190.4399999999998s)]
*  I've been saying publicly, I've been saying this [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1194.1599999999999s)]
*  since I was 20, since I was vax injured, [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1195.76s)]
*  but something that I've been saying public, [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1197.52s)]
*  since I've had a platform, is finally catching [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1199.1599999999999s)]
*  and people are starting to ask questions. [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1201.16s)]
*  And so I think that that's actually one of the places [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1203.0400000000002s)]
*  where the left and the right come together, [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1207.48s)]
*  because I say to my, like conservatives actually [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1208.72s)]
*  caught on late to the health movement. [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1210.28s)]
*  It was actually these leftist moms [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1211.72s)]
*  who were like super granola and crunchy, you know? [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1213.88s)]
*  I believe that for sure. [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1216.1200000000001s)]
*  Yeah, California moms, and they were the ones [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1217.28s)]
*  that were kind of, they were behind that health campaign [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1219.88s)]
*  long before conservatives caught onto it. [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1222.92s)]
*  And so, and where there was no information for parents [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1224.64s)]
*  who didn't want to choose to vaccinate their children. [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1227.16s)]
*  And I found RFK Jr., who I had disagreements with, [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1229.52s)]
*  but he was the only person that was publishing information [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1233.08s)]
*  via his children's health defense website. [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1237.16s)]
*  And I printed out everything and learned everything [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1239.36s)]
*  kind of from the beginning. [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1241.48s)]
*  And so to see this now become like a national movement [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1242.68s)]
*  is so cool. [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1245.2s)]
*  It's just about people having rights, [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1246.12s)]
*  like you know what I mean? [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1247.56s)]
*  Like you shouldn't be blindfolded. [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1248.48s)]
*  When you go into a hospital, you're there for a couple hours [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1250.04s)]
*  and you get a bill, it's $2,000. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1252.72s)]
*  You're like, yeah, that Tylenol we gave you, [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1254.36s)]
*  that was $300. [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1255.52s)]
*  Like, well, I've never taken the F in Tylenol. [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1257.32s)]
*  If I knew it was gonna be $300. [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1259.76s)]
*  Yeah, they're like, it was mined from the Tylenol mines [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1261.28s)]
*  in Rome or whatever. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1263.48s)]
*  And you're like, that is on your line. [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1264.36s)]
*  This is unbelievable though. [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1267.88s)]
*  I mean, this is, I think this is amazing. [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1268.84s)]
*  This is empowering patients [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1270.64s)]
*  through radical price transparency. [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1272.44s)]
*  Today, President Trump signed an executive order [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1274.36s)]
*  to empower patients with clear, accurate, [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1276.24s)]
*  and actionable healthcare pricing information. [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1278.08s)]
*  The order directs the Department of Treasury, Labor, [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1281.08s)]
*  and Health and Human Services to rapidly implement [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1283.16s)]
*  and enforce the healthcare price transparency regulations. [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1285.32s)]
*  The departments will insure hospitals and insurers [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1290.08s)]
*  disclose actual prices, not estimates, [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1293.08s)]
*  and take action to make prices comparable across hospitals. [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1295.32s)]
*  And yeah, I think because the number one cause, [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1298.52s)]
*  this is one thing that, like during the, [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1300.72s)]
*  I've never really been super political, [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1303.48s)]
*  but one thing that I did latch onto [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1304.88s)]
*  over the past few years is this program called [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1307.92s)]
*  Power to the Patients. [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1310.56s)]
*  And Fat Joe has been an advocate for them. [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1311.92s)]
*  We've done some stuff for them. [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1316.08s)]
*  John Jones, the UFC fighter. [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1317.24s)]
*  But it's that, yeah, when you go to, [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1320.36s)]
*  yeah, there they are right there. [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1323.16s)]
*  When you go to the hospital, [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1324.16s)]
*  they can just say, agree to pay. [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1325.32s)]
*  Then you get the bill later and the prices are insane. [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1328.24s)]
*  But you have no idea what the prices are. [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1330.96s)]
*  They're burglars and they're not even wearing fascinators. [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1333.2s)]
*  Yeah. You know what I mean? [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1335.28s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1336.1200000000001s)]
*  That's what pisses me off the most. [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1337.4s)]
*  They're not even wearing fascinators and they're burglars. [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1338.44s)]
*  And it's ridiculous because they're usually stealing [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1340.92s)]
*  from the poorest people in America. [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1343.32s)]
*  And it's so awful. [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1345.68s)]
*  It's so awful what's been allowed to happen. [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1347.2800000000002s)]
*  But sometimes when I see these executive orders, [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1349.5600000000002s)]
*  which by the way, I just random side thought [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1351.4s)]
*  because my brain works like this, [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1352.88s)]
*  Fat Joe is not fat anymore. [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1353.96s)]
*  He hasn't been fat for a very long time. [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1355.0800000000002s)]
*  That's true, but the price they charged him for it [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1356.64s)]
*  is insane though. [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1358.3200000000002s)]
*  Yeah, really? [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1359.16s)]
*  Crazy. [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1360.0s)]
*  He's in good shape now. [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1360.8400000000001s)]
*  You're right. Sorry, Medium Joe? [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1362.16s)]
*  Medium Joe, yeah, Medium Joe. [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1363.64s)]
*  But he's absolutely right. [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1366.44s)]
*  And it's, like I said, the people that suffer the most, [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1367.5200000000002s)]
*  and it seems like that is kind of the economic model [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1370.4s)]
*  of America is steal from the poor [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1372.44s)]
*  to further enrich the rich. [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1374.44s)]
*  And there's no greater example of that [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1376.04s)]
*  than the healthcare system. [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1377.76s)]
*  And it's ridiculous when people say, [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1378.92s)]
*  this is an example of capitalism. [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1380.24s)]
*  It's not, it's the exact opposite of capitalism. [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1381.6000000000001s)]
*  There cannot be capitalism in free markets [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1383.96s)]
*  where you don't know how much something costs. [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1386.0s)]
*  It would be wild. [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1387.44s)]
*  And I try to give people this understanding [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1388.28s)]
*  because you've grown up in this system [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1390.16s)]
*  so you think it's normal. [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1391.8400000000001s)]
*  It's the craziest thing you've ever seen. [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1392.68s)]
*  Like imagine you come into a store and you're like, [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1394.3200000000002s)]
*  how much does a shirt cost? [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1396.3200000000002s)]
*  Can't tell you right now. [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1398.8400000000001s)]
*  Can't tell you right now. [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1400.1200000000001s)]
*  Like, just pick up the shirt, see what you want, [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1400.96s)]
*  take whatever you want. [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1403.2s)]
*  And then we'll bill you. [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1404.72s)]
*  And they just make up the prices after you're gone. [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1405.56s)]
*  And they're like, actually like that one t-shirt [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1407.1599999999999s)]
*  was $20,000. [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1408.9199999999998s)]
*  And you're going, if I had known it was $20,000, [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1410.08s)]
*  I wouldn't have gotten the t-shirt. [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1411.72s)]
*  You have to be able to actually price shop [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1412.96s)]
*  and say, this store is now gonna go out of business [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1414.8799999999999s)]
*  because it's too expensive. [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1417.08s)]
*  And the greatest example of that is that you really know [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1418.6799999999998s)]
*  it's a drug cartel in operation. [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1420.6s)]
*  It's the ambitions of all of the people [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1422.28s)]
*  that they do documentary series on, [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1426.52s)]
*  or not documentary series, [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1428.56s)]
*  like create all of these Netflix series [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1429.3999999999999s)]
*  about the big drug dealers. [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1430.6399999999999s)]
*  What's the name of the cartel family? [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1431.8799999999999s)]
*  Purdue? [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1433.52s)]
*  No, in Mexico. [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1434.6s)]
*  Oh, uh. [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1436.24s)]
*  But yes, to the Sacklers. [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1438.0s)]
*  But essentially, El Chapo, yeah. [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1439.36s)]
*  When you think about El Chapo [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1442.2s)]
*  and who's the guy in Columbia as well. [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1443.36s)]
*  I hit on his wife online one time. [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1445.6s)]
*  Did you, El Chapo's wife? [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1447.08s)]
*  It was an accident. [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1448.72s)]
*  Yeah, it wasn't. [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1449.56s)]
*  I mean, it wasn't an accident, [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1450.4s)]
*  but I thought he was deceased, he's not. [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1451.24s)]
*  Oh, so you're probably gonna get killed. [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1452.56s)]
*  Sad. [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1455.2s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1456.04s)]
*  Yeah, I really like your stuff. [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1456.8799999999999s)]
*  Sad, that's awesome. [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1457.7s)]
*  Yeah, sad. [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1458.54s)]
*  That's feelings go fast these days, man. [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1459.3799999999999s)]
*  But what are you saying that it's very similar to this? [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1462.92s)]
*  It's a cartel, it's what they wanted. [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1464.0400000000002s)]
*  They wanted a marriage with the government [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1465.3600000000001s)]
*  so that they would be able to push drugs. [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1467.0400000000002s)]
*  That's exactly what America is. [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1469.16s)]
*  And we do these series, [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1470.96s)]
*  like we're like so highfalutin, [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1472.0400000000002s)]
*  like the oof, oof, we would never engage. [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1473.5600000000002s)]
*  This is what we do. [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1475.96s)]
*  It is a drug trade that is happening in plain sight, [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1477.0400000000002s)]
*  and you've got politicians who accept it [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1479.4s)]
*  because we have more big pharma lobbyists in DC [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1482.3200000000002s)]
*  than we have congressmen. [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1485.5800000000002s)]
*  That's wild. [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1486.6000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, it's unbelievable. [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1487.44s)]
*  And this was one thing that Bernie Sanders [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1489.0400000000002s)]
*  and Trump agreed on that they answered. [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1490.88s)]
*  This was like one thing that both sides, [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1493.8000000000002s)]
*  like it was bipartisan, right? [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1496.7600000000002s)]
*  But my question is, because now when you go, [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1498.8000000000002s)]
*  you can say, okay, well if it's $700 here for this MRI, [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1501.8400000000001s)]
*  I'm gonna call across the street, [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1504.64s)]
*  and they're gonna have to make it 500 [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1506.24s)]
*  if they want your business. [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1508.0800000000002s)]
*  So now you'll get to the actual prices eventually. [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1509.0s)]
*  And that's what happened with LASIK surgery. [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1512.8400000000001s)]
*  So what's interesting is that when [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1514.2600000000002s)]
*  insurance companies kicked out, [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1515.8000000000002s)]
*  LASIK surgery used to be something [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1517.2800000000002s)]
*  that insurance companies covered, [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1518.48s)]
*  and then they decided that it was cosmetic, [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1519.8799999999999s)]
*  so they were no longer gonna cover it. [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1521.48s)]
*  When insurance companies were covering it, [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1522.9599999999998s)]
*  it was about $10,000, $10,000 to $15,000 per eye. [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1524.36s)]
*  Then when they said we're not gonna cover it, [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1528.6799999999998s)]
*  suddenly the doctors had to compete, [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1530.06s)]
*  and now you can get LASIK eye surgery [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1532.08s)]
*  for $3,500 for both of your eyes. [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1534.1399999999999s)]
*  Well they need you to be able to see [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1536.76s)]
*  so they can fuck you over. [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1538.1599999999999s)]
*  That's why that's a problem. [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1539.28s)]
*  They're like, we can't even fuck these people over anymore [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1541.52s)]
*  because they can't see. [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1544.24s)]
*  Yo, yo, you hoopin'. [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1546.08s)]

*  I've been in, I've been out. [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1693.08s)]
*  At one point I was checking Bitcoin prices [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1696.8799999999999s)]
*  more than I was checking my own pulse. [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1699.3999999999999s)]
*  I sold it all a couple of times. [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1701.8799999999999s)]

*  Disclaimer, this isn't financial advice. [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1726.24s)]
*  Trading crypto carries risk [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1728.86s)]

*  MoonPay is here to facilitate, not advise. [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1733.08s)]
*  Same as myself. [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1737.04s)]
*  Get rid of these insurance companies [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1739.84s)]
*  so that we can just pay for what stuff costs. [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1741.56s)]
*  Like I'm happy to go into CVS and buy the $15 Thailand [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1743.3999999999999s)]
*  all rather than to pay [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1747.32s)]
*  because the insurance companies are gauging prices [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1748.8799999999999s)]
*  and suddenly it's $300 for a piece of stuff. [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1751.9199999999998s)]
*  And then the stress too. [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1754.04s)]
*  That's the thing that Bernie Sanders [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1755.08s)]
*  was talking a ton about. [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1756.1599999999999s)]
*  It's like the stress that people sit there [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1757.0s)]
*  because the number one cause of bankruptcy [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1758.7199999999998s)]
*  is medical debt in America. [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1760.28s)]
*  And just the stress that that causes people. [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1763.0s)]
*  You've lived your life, suddenly you're sick. [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1765.52s)]
*  You're gonna get sick anyway because you're getting older [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1767.54s)]
*  and now you just are stressed at the price [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1769.8s)]
*  because they send this thing. [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1771.8799999999999s)]
*  And then the value you put on your own life at that moment [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1773.06s)]
*  and the constant stress of calling these companies [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1776.04s)]
*  and just this war. [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1779.06s)]
*  And yeah, medical debt is the leading cause of bankruptcy [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1780.48s)]
*  in the US accounting for 66.5% of all bankruptcies. [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1784.68s)]
*  And there's a talk right now of Medicaid being cut, right? [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1787.96s)]
*  But this, and I'm hoping this is part of their plan [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1791.4s)]
*  that they will enforce this. [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1796.3600000000001s)]
*  Because that's the problem. [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1798.24s)]
*  This happened before that Trump made this an order [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1799.16s)]
*  and it wasn't enforced. [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1801.72s)]
*  It was when he was leaving office. [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1802.72s)]
*  So I'm hoping that this time that this is something [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1804.72s)]
*  that they will enforce and will actually get the prices down. [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1807.04s)]
*  And then you won't even need as much Medicaid [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1811.1599999999999s)]
*  because the prices will be real. [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1812.6s)]
*  So I'm hoping it's part of a simultaneous thing [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1814.84s)]
*  that they're doing. [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1817.76s)]
*  Well, it's good that it's become [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1818.6s)]
*  the mainstream conversation [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1819.6399999999999s)]
*  because most people didn't understand it. [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1821.56s)]
*  Like I said, when you grow up in a system [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1822.8s)]
*  and the congressman will then do a really good job [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1824.4399999999998s)]
*  of making you fearful. [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1827.52s)]
*  Like, if this happens, if we get rid of Medicaid, [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1828.48s)]
*  if we get rid of Obamacare, whatever it is, [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1831.0s)]
*  then you guys are not gonna be able to afford. [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1833.4199999999998s)]
*  It's actually the exact opposite. [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1835.24s)]
*  Like you get rid of these things [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1836.6s)]
*  and you'll be able to afford it [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1838.24s)]
*  because you're getting rid of all these people [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1839.42s)]
*  that are just taking money from you and stealing from you. [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1840.74s)]
*  Why do you think it takes, [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1843.5s)]
*  like this is one thing I'm noticing about government. [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1844.7s)]
*  It's like, no matter who's in office, [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1847.14s)]
*  whether it's Republicans or Democrats, [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1850.78s)]
*  it's always the same shit. [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1855.1200000000001s)]
*  Nothing ever changes, you know? [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1856.74s)]
*  It's like you would think at some point [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1858.9s)]
*  they would give you the, you know, [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1861.02s)]
*  you would get some of these things solved. [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1863.8200000000002s)]
*  Like even with this, like why does it take something so long? [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1865.8600000000001s)]
*  Like are both sides just screwing? [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1868.9s)]
*  You start to think that just both sides are just screwing us. [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1871.14s)]
*  Well, we need term limits. [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1874.0s)]
*  This is the problem. [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1875.3s)]
*  So if you have no incentive, [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1876.14s)]
*  if you are going into government [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1877.5s)]
*  and you know that you can stay in government forever, [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1878.7s)]
*  then you have to think of government as your employer. [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1880.9s)]
*  And you want the company that you work for, [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1883.1s)]
*  in the same way that you have a company, [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1884.98s)]
*  I have a company, to grow, right? [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1886.02s)]
*  Obviously your job here when you're doing this podcast, [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1888.98s)]
*  you're not like, well, what can I do to make [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1891.46s)]
*  the podcast smaller, you know? [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1893.38s)]
*  And so they are going there and if they had term limits, [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1895.26s)]
*  they would be like, well, in four years, [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1898.02s)]
*  if we say four or six years, whatever it is, [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1899.94s)]
*  I gotta go back and be a regular American. [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1901.54s)]
*  So I have no incentive to help grow government. [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1903.02s)]
*  I have every incentive to help grow individuals [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1905.82s)]
*  and grow families and make sure that prices are low. [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1907.9s)]
*  They're going in with the exact wrong mentality. [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1910.26s)]
*  Then they get in there and it's like, [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1911.8600000000001s)]
*  you can actually be here and tell me, [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1913.3s)]
*  how old is Nancy Pelosi? [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1914.4s)]
*  She's like the crypt keeper, right? [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1915.98s)]
*  Think about how old our government is [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1917.6200000000001s)]
*  and they've been there forever. [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1919.26s)]
*  Biden's been in government forever. [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1920.26s)]
*  So their incentive becomes, this is my company [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1922.24s)]
*  and I'm gonna help grow it. [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1925.26s)]
*  And then the lobbyists come to them [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1926.34s)]
*  and they wanna stay in office forever. [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1928.38s)]
*  They wanna grow their power. [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1929.22s)]
*  Oh Chuck Schumer, that slurped lizard's [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1930.06s)]
*  been in there for fricking forever. [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1931.06s)]
*  Yes, and so that would change overnight. [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1932.3400000000001s)]
*  Their incentives to recognize that they're gonna spend [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1934.82s)]
*  the majority of their life outside of government [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1938.22s)]
*  would make them go in there [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1940.74s)]
*  and want to make things better for us. [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1942.44s)]
*  And that's the problem. [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1944.32s)]
*  So I'm a big supporter of term limits. [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1945.16s)]
*  And there's a problem where people shouldn't be able, [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1948.46s)]
*  if they're in government, they shouldn't be able [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1952.14s)]
*  to then work for lobbies right after [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1954.66s)]
*  because then they're working for the lobbies. [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1956.52s)]
*  That was one thing. [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1959.88s)]
*  The lobbying shouldn't be allowed, [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1960.72s)]
*  in my view point, it should be allowed period. [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1961.54s)]
*  It should be just completely outlawed. [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1963.0s)]
*  But every American feels that way. [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1964.84s)]
*  So why is it like, what are we even fucking doing then? [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1966.84s)]
*  It feels like. [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1970.48s)]
*  Because they don't care what we think. [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1971.32s)]
*  And that's why Trump referred to it as a swamp, right? [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1972.96s)]
*  They don't actually care what we think. [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1975.96s)]
*  Once you get them into office, [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1977.24s)]
*  their job is to keep themselves into office, [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1978.66s)]
*  keep themselves empowered forever. [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1980.8s)]
*  And they're just in the business of trying to explain [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1982.48s)]
*  in really dumb terms to the American people, [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1986.76s)]
*  like I said, fear mongering. [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1988.4399999999998s)]
*  Well, the reason I had to sign this, [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1989.9599999999998s)]
*  and it's all buried, it's like 3000. [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1991.12s)]
*  That's why I love Thomas Massey, by the way, [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1993.0s)]
*  because Thomas Massey will say, [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1994.6399999999999s)]
*  these bills that we're signing are one line. [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=1996.04s)]
*  Instead, it's like, if they even ever agree [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2000.0s)]
*  to do anything for us, [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2002.1999999999998s)]
*  it's because they've already done 37 million things [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2003.04s)]
*  for themselves in the first 37,000 pages of the document. [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2005.56s)]
*  And then the last page, [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2008.76s)]
*  it's something for the American people. [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2009.84s)]
*  It's crazy. [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2011.6s)]
*  Why do bills need to be 300 pages long? [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2012.4399999999998s)]
*  And lobbyists are writing half of the bills too. [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2015.64s)]
*  That's one of the craziest things. [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2017.6000000000001s)]
*  They're writing the bills, [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2018.44s)]
*  they're getting the bills passed, [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2019.2800000000002s)]
*  and we have a bunch of traitors in Congress. [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2020.48s)]
*  I mean, that is just the reality of the circumstances. [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2023.3600000000001s)]
*  And anybody telling you that it's just traitors on the left [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2025.2s)]
*  or traitors on the right is lying to you. [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2027.52s)]
*  We have traitors on both sides. [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2029.92s)]
*  It's very obvious we have traitors on both sides. [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2031.3600000000001s)]
*  But how do they keep them from just saying, [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2033.48s)]
*  hey, wouldn't you think at least two or three people a year [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2035.2s)]
*  would be like, hey, this whole thing's a fucking charade? [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2039.72s)]
*  They do. [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2042.2800000000002s)]
*  Rand Paul, Ron Paul, Rand Paul, Thomas, so few, so few, [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2043.12s)]
*  because that's what money is. [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2047.4399999999998s)]
*  People worship money, they don't worship values. [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2049.2s)]
*  We have this issue in the media, [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2051.6s)]
*  we have this issue in government, [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2053.3599999999997s)]
*  we have this issue in business. [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2054.6s)]
*  There is just something about money [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2056.3599999999997s)]
*  that just turns everyone into a prostitute. [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2057.72s)]
*  And it's sad. [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2060.48s)]
*  I mean, I've seen it up close. [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2061.56s)]
*  I've been, there's this expression, never meet your idols. [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2062.72s)]
*  And I felt that the closer that I got to politics, [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2068.3199999999997s)]
*  the more I realized how much I hate politics. [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2072.44s)]
*  I've always hated politics, but you hate it extra [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2075.32s)]
*  once you start to meet people and you realize [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2077.04s)]
*  that everyone's in it just to enrich themselves. [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2079.44s)]
*  And so few people will be able to walk away from riches, [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2082.0s)]
*  so to speak, because they actually want [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2087.0s)]
*  to do something good. [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2088.7200000000003s)]
*  And those people tend to have something [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2089.68s)]
*  that's so much better than riches, [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2091.52s)]
*  which is like their lives are in order. [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2092.48s)]
*  They have families, they're actually happy. [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2093.84s)]
*  They don't want more, you know? [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2096.36s)]
*  Yeah, I think that's what dumb founds me the most. [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2099.08s)]
*  And you believe this program, you believe it, [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2102.64s)]
*  because as I guess like an American [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2104.6s)]
*  or a citizen of any country, you want to believe [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2106.8s)]
*  in the altruistic nature, not totally altruistic, [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2109.6s)]
*  but at least maybe 75% altruistic nature of people, [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2112.64s)]
*  or that people want to do well. [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2116.2799999999997s)]
*  Yeah, I think that's one of the things that's most baffling. [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2119.44s)]
*  And then at a certain point, does that just have [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2121.56s)]
*  to start to turn because the grossness of wealth, [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2123.52s)]
*  it starts, you just start to see how sick it is [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2128.52s)]
*  and how sour it is. [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2131.16s)]
*  That's easy for me to say that, you know, [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2133.24s)]
*  I can pay my mortgage and I have, you know, [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2134.68s)]
*  know that I can afford food. [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2136.3599999999997s)]
*  So maybe that's an unfair thing for me to say, [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2138.88s)]
*  but I just think there's this overall kind of theory there [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2140.8399999999997s)]
*  or feeling there. [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2144.44s)]
*  So what do you think is going to be different [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2145.6s)]
*  about Trump in office this time? [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2146.72s)]
*  Like, I mean, I think it's good if they enforce this thing, [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2148.4s)]
*  that's going to be amazing. [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2152.2799999999997s)]
*  I'm curious to see if they will. [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2153.24s)]
*  But what do you think is going to be different [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2155.4s)]
*  about him in office this time? [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2157.68s)]
*  There's going to be great stuff [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2159.72s)]
*  and there's going to be bad stuff. [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2161.2s)]
*  There's no question in my mind, you know, [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2162.64s)]
*  that Trump is less beholden to the state. [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2164.48s)]
*  And that was why the state fought so hard to keep him out. [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2167.04s)]
*  And I always pay attention to those people [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2169.52s)]
*  because I have a almost reverse relationship with the media. [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2171.12s)]
*  When someone's being super attacked [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2174.36s)]
*  and the entire mainstream media hates them, [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2176.6s)]
*  I usually assume that there's some modicum of truth there. [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2178.84s)]
*  There's something that they're fighting for [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2181.92s)]
*  that makes them hate them so much. [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2183.08s)]
*  And that's like how I came across Thomas Massey. [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2184.48s)]
*  And I would say with Trump, [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2186.24s)]
*  he is definitely a person that does not love war. [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2189.08s)]
*  And so the military industrial complex, [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2192.6s)]
*  and he's definitely a person who looks at things [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2195.2s)]
*  like a businessman, which is just, [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2197.9599999999996s)]
*  why would you want to have all of this money going out [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2199.2799999999997s)]
*  of your company, so to speak, [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2201.7999999999997s)]
*  if you treat your country like a company, [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2203.2s)]
*  and it makes entirely, [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2205.0s)]
*  and you don't even know where it's going, [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2206.3199999999997s)]
*  going to obscure causes. [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2207.3999999999996s)]
*  Like, why are we funding like Pakistani LGBT rights? [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2208.68s)]
*  Like weird, when you take a look at it. [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2211.68s)]
*  And so it's cool to see him instantly attack that [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2213.44s)]
*  and that they're automatically, [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2216.88s)]
*  I mean, like when they went through, you said, [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2217.96s)]
*  it's just amazing to see that. [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2220.2400000000002s)]
*  So I think in terms of the economy, [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2221.32s)]
*  we are going to instantly kind of bounce back [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2223.6400000000003s)]
*  and people are, you can already feel it now. [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2225.36s)]
*  People aren't holding their money as much. [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2227.2400000000002s)]
*  I think there was, to me, I felt, [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2229.32s)]
*  and I don't know if I'm biased because I'm conservative, [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2231.32s)]
*  but there was a kind of a darkness and a fear [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2233.6s)]
*  when Biden was president. [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2235.52s)]
*  And it wasn't because Biden was president, [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2237.1200000000003s)]
*  it was because we knew Biden wasn't president. [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2238.6400000000003s)]
*  It's not quite strange. [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2240.6s)]
*  That's like the scariest part. [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2241.92s)]
*  Like it wasn't because he was president, [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2243.12s)]
*  it was because he wasn't president. [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2244.36s)]
*  So it's like, who was running the country? [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2246.2s)]
*  I agree. [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2247.96s)]
*  I can't believe that every day [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2248.8s)]
*  there wasn't a newspaper article from every company [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2249.64s)]
*  that was like, hey, there is a man [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2253.12s)]
*  who is obviously being commandeered, [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2255.64s)]
*  who is a puppet because he is not mentally well. [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2258.52s)]
*  It's not even a knock on him, the guy's not well. [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2261.8s)]
*  It's like, if somebody did that to my grandfather or father, [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2264.64s)]
*  I've said that forever. [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2267.56s)]
*  It's embarrassing, yeah, that the family let it do it. [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2270.68s)]
*  It's embarrassing to the rest of the world. [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2272.56s)]
*  It's like, people can tell the guy's not well [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2273.8s)]
*  and they put him on the bike for 40 feet or whatever. [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2275.64s)]
*  And it was like, who put him on the bike? [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2278.0s)]
*  Falls over. [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2280.12s)]
*  Well, it's just like, you can't put that guy on a bike, dude. [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2280.96s)]
*  It was elder abuse. [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2284.48s)]
*  It is, that's what it felt like to me. [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2285.7599999999998s)]
*  It felt like elder abuse and it felt like a horrible way [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2287.0s)]
*  also for the world to see us like, [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2289.12s)]
*  oh, this is what they think of their elders, right? [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2290.7599999999998s)]
*  And that kind of hits you in a place where like, [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2293.84s)]
*  man, it's just gross. [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2295.48s)]
*  Like people took advantage of this guy. [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2297.08s)]
*  I'm amazed that his wife didn't speak up. [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2298.48s)]
*  Maybe that his children didn't speak up. [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2301.08s)]
*  But also, I don't know what their lives are like. [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2303.36s)]
*  I don't really know. [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2305.72s)]
*  And maybe he wanted to not. [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2307.2799999999997s)]
*  There may have been a big part of him that he did, [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2308.96s)]
*  was able to speak well and communicate and said, [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2310.84s)]
*  I don't, I wanna keep going, you know? [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2312.92s)]
*  But what do you, like I'm kind of conflicted about Trump [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2315.96s)]
*  like with his stance on Gaza, right? [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2320.88s)]
*  To me, that's like. [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2325.04s)]
*  I totally disagree with him on it. [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2326.24s)]
*  And it's like, it's hard to reconcile it in many ways. [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2327.6s)]
*  It's hard to reconcile because I see so much hypocrisy [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2331.64s)]
*  in terms of when we say America first, [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2334.7599999999998s)]
*  for whatever reason, we have this magic carve out. [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2336.88s)]
*  And you cannot pretend that that's not because [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2339.08s)]
*  AIPAC spends a hundred million dollars in our election. [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2341.0s)]
*  And this gets back to what we were talking about, [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2343.7599999999998s)]
*  whether it's Big Pharma, whether it's Israel, [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2345.08s)]
*  everyone's for sale in DC. [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2347.24s)]
*  And so I have been very disappointed with Trump [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2349.2s)]
*  on his perspectives about Gaza. [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2351.72s)]
*  I have been disappointed by the way, [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2354.36s)]
*  he's the last person I'm disappointed with [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2356.64s)]
*  because I've been disappointed, as we saw all last year, [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2358.08s)]
*  with the conservatives, people that say they're Christians [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2360.2s)]
*  who are condoning this on the basis of what? [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2362.96s)]
*  Like you're saying, oh, well, they're Muslims, so who cares? [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2364.68s)]
*  And that gets into our programming, [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2366.96s)]
*  which I've spoken about in my podcast [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2368.6s)]
*  of this 9-11 programming where we just don't see Muslims [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2370.16s)]
*  as like human life. [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2372.92s)]
*  And to me, to speak about Gaza [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2373.8399999999997s)]
*  and talking about casinos and hotels, [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2378.68s)]
*  and these people just lost their entire families, [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2381.3199999999997s)]
*  it's so far removed from humanity. [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2383.68s)]
*  And I think it's wrong. [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2386.68s)]
*  And I'm tired of America being used as Israel's piggyback. [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2388.7999999999997s)]
*  For whatever reason, everyone can critique [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2391.8399999999997s)]
*  every other country for taking money from us. [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2393.24s)]
*  And then there's just, everyone's blind [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2395.16s)]
*  when it comes to Israel. [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2397.24s)]
*  And obviously I paid a very heavy price [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2398.48s)]
*  for saying that last year, but I don't care [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2400.12s)]
*  because I am truly someone whose values [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2401.64s)]
*  have never been up for sale. [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2403.7999999999997s)]
*  I don't care. [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2404.64s)]
*  I will burn everything to the ground and rebuild it. [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2405.46s)]
*  I have to be able to sleep at night [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2407.44s)]
*  and to see those Palestinian children [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2409.52s)]
*  and the images are seared into my brain. [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2413.7599999999998s)]
*  The screaming, the crying, the bleeding, [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2416.52s)]
*  the stuff that we saw on X for the first time, [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2418.4399999999996s)]
*  largely thanks to Elon freeing the bird [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2420.3599999999997s)]
*  and really realizing how much we had been lied to [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2422.24s)]
*  about what was happening in that region. [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2425.9199999999996s)]
*  I just, it was very easy for me to say, [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2427.72s)]
*  take whatever you have to take from me. [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2430.3199999999997s)]
*  I have to be on the human side of things. [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2431.64s)]
*  I think it's become both sides of the aisle now [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2433.8399999999997s)]
*  just see that human people just feel like this, [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2436.8399999999997s)]
*  that it's just wrong. [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2441.56s)]
*  What's happened is wrong. [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2442.4s)]
*  Like probably a year ago, people were afraid [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2443.7200000000003s)]
*  to even say that. [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2446.08s)]
*  And now it is what everybody is saying. [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2446.92s)]
*  Like even Piers Morgan is saying it on his show now. [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2449.48s)]
*  Like people are saying it's obvious [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2452.0s)]
*  that you can't go and annihilate and genocide this culture [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2454.2000000000003s)]
*  and just make them disappear. [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2457.84s)]
*  And then Trump to come on top of it [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2459.6800000000003s)]
*  and say they're gonna build, [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2461.84s)]
*  who's gonna, you're gonna go on a lazy river [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2463.8s)]
*  where there's bodies of like, who could even go to that? [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2466.64s)]
*  And what's so crazy is the mainstream media [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2470.44s)]
*  thinking that we're so stupid, [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2475.12s)]
*  that they're going to condition us to believe [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2476.96s)]
*  that to not support the ethnic cleansing, [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2480.04s)]
*  they're then gonna mine our like pre-conditioned beliefs [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2482.48s)]
*  about the Holocaust and be like, [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2486.08s)]
*  oh, well, a Jewish person died. [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2488.12s)]
*  So if you don't agree with what we're doing over here, [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2489.6800000000003s)]
*  then you're a person that wants more Jewish people to die. [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2491.96s)]
*  It's like, this is an evil way [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2495.08s)]
*  to try to socially engineer what you want [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2498.28s)]
*  because actually it's precisely because of what I learned [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2501.32s)]
*  growing up about Holocaust and ethnic cleansing [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2503.44s)]
*  that I do not support what the state of Israel is doing. [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2505.6800000000003s)]
*  And you're trying to convince me that it means [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2507.96s)]
*  that if anybody's been wronged in the past, [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2509.6800000000003s)]
*  they can't wrong people in the future. [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2511.52s)]
*  You're also wrongly conflating like a Jewish American, [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2513.2400000000002s)]
*  you have nothing to do with this one on Israel. [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2515.96s)]
*  This is a foreign country. [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2516.8s)]
*  No more than if right now we were standing up [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2518.8s)]
*  to a genocide that was happening in Ghana. [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2520.6400000000003s)]
*  And then when I'm gonna be like, [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2522.6800000000003s)]
*  oh, well, if you don't support what the president of Ghana [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2523.52s)]
*  wants to do, then you want American slavery back. [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2528.24s)]
*  I'm like, it's like, what are you talking about? [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2530.3999999999996s)]
*  Just because I'm black and maybe my family is from Ghana, [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2531.8799999999997s)]
*  why on earth would I not be able to critique [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2535.48s)]
*  a foreign country for something that they're doing [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2537.48s)]
*  that is so objectively wrong? [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2538.9199999999996s)]
*  And so it's disappointed me as someone who just [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2540.52s)]
*  had so much respect and belief in the conservative movement [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2544.72s)]
*  and believing that it was a principled movement [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2548.56s)]
*  and Christians as well. [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2550.7599999999998s)]
*  I've been very disappointed in Christians [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2552.0s)]
*  who are trying to use this like biblical argument [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2553.72s)]
*  for just, well, no matter what. [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2558.2799999999997s)]
*  Are people doing that? [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2560.56s)]
*  Yeah, it's pretty sick, man. [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2561.56s)]
*  It is very sick. [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2563.3199999999997s)]
*  They're basically saying that the Bible will bless those [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2564.6s)]
*  who bless Israel. [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2569.0s)]
*  And I'm like, okay, so we have a country who first [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2569.8799999999997s)]
*  and foremost doesn't have to give us back our pedophiles. [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2572.04s)]
*  Literally, they have this weird rule that you can go [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2574.12s)]
*  if you're Jewish and hide as a pedophile [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2577.12s)]
*  and actually an amazing Jewish organization [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2579.04s)]
*  did the work there. [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2581.2799999999997s)]
*  You could pull it up. [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2582.28s)]
*  I think it was on CBS. [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2583.84s)]
*  I forgot what the name of the Jewish organization, [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2585.0800000000004s)]
*  but they followed, went to Israel. [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2586.84s)]
*  I was like, why are we harboring pedophiles? [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2588.0400000000004s)]
*  So there was a Jewish organization [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2589.8s)]
*  that they had pedophiles. [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2591.6800000000003s)]
*  No, they were not the pedophiles. [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2593.48s)]
*  They did the investigation to show how people are using, [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2594.76s)]
*  how people who have molested children in America, [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2599.2400000000002s)]
*  if they're Jewish, they can then make their trip to Israel [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2601.6800000000003s)]
*  and be protected by the government. [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2604.84s)]
*  And Israel doesn't have to bring, [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2606.0s)]
*  they literally don't have to, yeah. [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2607.8s)]
*  CBS News, that's second one. [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2610.92s)]
*  Right? [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2613.96s)]
*  You will not find a single person who says that that's wrong. [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2614.8s)]
*  Hide from justice in Israel. [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2616.96s)]
*  But can't they hide, can't most people say if you are, [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2619.08s)]
*  so these are people that are Israeli citizens? [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2622.16s)]
*  No, they can then become Israeli citizens. [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2625.52s)]
*  They're American, right? [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2627.2400000000002s)]
*  So if they just hop, if they're being in like on a trial, [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2628.44s)]
*  you get to Israel, they'll protect you. [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2631.08s)]
*  And so they went and went to where all these pedophiles are [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2632.8s)]
*  and spoke a lot about, you know, this, this, [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2636.64s)]
*  I can't remember the name of the organization, [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2639.0s)]
*  but they did amazing work. [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2640.08s)]
*  They are Jewish Community Watch, that's what it is. [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2640.92s)]
*  And so that's what I mean where it's like, [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2643.0s)]
*  there's also this wrong conflation that annoys me as well, [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2644.2s)]
*  because you have Jewish organizations [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2646.8s)]
*  who will objectively say this is wrong. [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2648.32s)]
*  They recognize they are Americans, [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2650.2400000000002s)]
*  they don't support pedophiles. [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2651.56s)]
*  And yet the mainstream media is trying to conflate them [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2652.8s)]
*  and make them think that they have to defend [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2655.32s)]
*  the actions of this state. [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2657.36s)]
*  And yeah, if you even talk about this, [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2659.2s)]
*  so say it's anti-Semitic, talk about this. [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2660.28s)]
*  What are you talking about? [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2661.44s)]
*  You're taking billions, that's the difference here. [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2662.28s)]
*  This is a country that is taking billions [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2664.16s)]
*  and billions and billions. [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2665.84s)]
*  It's an American welfare state, you know, [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2666.84s)]
*  and CBS jumped on it. [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2669.32s)]
*  CBS News investigation has found [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2670.32s)]
*  that many accused American pedophiles flee to Israel [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2671.76s)]
*  and bringing them justice can be difficult. [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2675.0s)]
*  Okay, has been trying for years to find Caro [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2678.1600000000003s)]
*  and help bring the justice. [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2682.08s)]
*  So Jimmy Caro, he's a wanted man and is considered dangerous, [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2683.1600000000003s)]
*  accused of assaulting a nine-year-old girl in Oregon in 2000. [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2686.88s)]
*  He fled to Israel before authorities in the US [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2689.1600000000003s)]
*  could apprehend him. [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2690.96s)]
*  But is this just one guy? [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2691.88s)]
*  No, no, so this is a story about how they are doing this. [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2693.2000000000003s)]
*  The main story is like that they were investigating [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2696.2s)]
*  is that there's so many people that did this. [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2697.96s)]
*  Why do they allow it? [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2699.52s)]
*  Because they have special consideration [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2700.7999999999997s)]
*  and they are not allowed, [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2704.08s)]
*  they don't have to give us back our pedophiles. [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2705.2799999999997s)]
*  I don't know, I don't, [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2707.04s)]
*  I never understand this random Israeli loopholes. [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2707.96s)]
*  And it's ridiculous. [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2711.12s)]
*  And the fact that they can just call people anti-Semitic, [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2712.3199999999997s)]
*  like a sweeping allegation. [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2714.48s)]
*  How dare you notice that this is happening over here? [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2716.72s)]
*  You anti-Semite. [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2719.2799999999997s)]
*  And it's like, we have every right to critique this nation [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2720.44s)]
*  because you take money from us, especially, right? [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2723.3599999999997s)]
*  When we go to work and taxes are being taken away, [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2726.4s)]
*  we're paying to support this. [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2729.56s)]
*  And then we're being gaslit by the media [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2731.4s)]
*  who's telling us that critiquing them in any way [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2733.08s)]
*  is an act of hatred for Jews, [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2735.4s)]
*  which is just such a nonsense. [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2737.12s)]
*  Oh, I think I don't like that Netanyahu guy, man. [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2738.84s)]
*  I hate him. [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2741.32s)]
*  That guy seems like an evil guy to me. [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2742.1600000000003s)]
*  And I think he's seemed like that to most people now [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2744.04s)]
*  because of, I mean, mostly I think it's just like, [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2746.56s)]
*  nobody wants war or anything [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2751.48s)]
*  and we're lucky to live in a place where, [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2752.88s)]
*  like Tennessee's not at war with Kentucky. [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2755.44s)]
*  So there's not like the risk every day or night [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2760.72s)]
*  of things flying over the fence. [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2763.2799999999997s)]
*  But I've thought that America is a, [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2766.92s)]
*  kind of like a shell company. [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2770.96s)]
*  But maybe it's always just been that way. [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2772.72s)]
*  Like, that's the thing. [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2774.64s)]
*  Like maybe it's always been that way. [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2776.92s)]
*  Maybe it isn't. [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2778.68s)]
*  I just would like to know what it is, right? [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2779.56s)]
*  So then it's like, you can operate within the reality [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2781.7999999999997s)]
*  of things. [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2785.56s)]
*  But then also people say that, [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2786.4s)]
*  well, why do you think there's such a strong relationship [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2788.64s)]
*  between the two countries then? [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2790.7999999999997s)]
*  Blackmail. [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2792.56s)]
*  I think blackmail. [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2795.0s)]
*  And I think this is the reason [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2795.96s)]
*  why we don't get to open the Epstein files. [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2796.92s)]
*  We don't get to open the JFK files. [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2798.56s)]
*  And I think it's a form of gaslighting us to pretend [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2800.08s)]
*  that our special friend and ally isn't just a, [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2802.7999999999997s)]
*  I mean, and by the way, [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2805.7999999999997s)]
*  parking aside America, other countries too, [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2807.04s)]
*  you investigate anything. [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2808.92s)]
*  I mean, I'm investigating Brigitte Macron [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2810.16s)]
*  and Israeli blackmail comes up in Morocco. [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2812.64s)]
*  Israeli blackmail comes up in, [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2814.64s)]
*  so to pretend that we don't know that Israel is involved [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2816.12s)]
*  in blackmail operations is foolish. [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2818.6s)]
*  And again, it's the reason. [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2820.52s)]
*  I think all countries are probably involved in them. [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2821.3599999999997s)]
*  And I think that they have been like the, [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2823.16s)]
*  they have gotten it down to a science. [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2824.8399999999997s)]
*  And there's no question in my mind that like sexual blackmail [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2826.64s)]
*  is what Jeffrey Epstein was involved in. [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2829.96s)]
*  And I don't know if that means these people don't know [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2832.0s)]
*  when they go to these parties that the girls are underaged [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2835.7599999999998s)]
*  and then it's like, haha, we've got you on tape, [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2837.6s)]
*  whatever it is. [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2839.44s)]
*  And we can even, taking a look at the Diddy case, [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2840.52s)]
*  blackmail, these little black, these blackmail, [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2843.12s)]
*  powerful blackmail operations are definitely operating. [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2845.24s)]
*  And- [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2848.32s)]
*  And that's actual blackmail too. [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2849.16s)]
*  Yeah, it's true blackmail. [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2850.28s)]
*  I mean, if you have hidden cameras [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2851.12s)]
*  and you're capturing people doing drugs [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2852.56s)]
*  and sleeping with underage people. [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2854.2s)]
*  So I think it's, these are blackmail operations. [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2855.56s)]
*  And I think they've been going on for decades in America. [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2857.96s)]
*  I think it was Jeffrey Sachs who spoke really well [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2860.16s)]
*  about that, the history of that on Tucker Carlson's show. [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2863.32s)]
*  And he's Jewish. [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2866.28s)]
*  And that's what I hate about it. [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2867.12s)]
*  It's trying to make Jewish Americans think [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2867.94s)]
*  that they have to defend the country is so ridiculous. [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2870.9599999999996s)]
*  I am not required to, if my family goes back to Uganda, [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2872.52s)]
*  I'm not required to defend Uganda as a state. [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2876.16s)]
*  I'm sorry, I'm an American. [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2878.08s)]
*  And I think what you're doing is wrong [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2879.4399999999996s)]
*  if it doesn't really matter, you know? [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2881.9599999999996s)]
*  And you're right to say that it's sort of this circumstance [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2884.2799999999997s)]
*  where everybody knows something is going on [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2887.68s)]
*  and they think they're just gonna keep gaslighting us. [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2890.12s)]
*  It's so weird. [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2892.0s)]
*  Like they're just gonna go, nothing's going on, nothing. [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2892.8199999999997s)]
*  There's just every day, everybody woke up one day [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2895.7599999999998s)]
*  and decided to be Hitler. [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2898.12s)]
*  That's what the media is basically accusing us of [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2899.68s)]
*  for noticing a lot of dead people, [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2901.4s)]
*  a lot of dead women and children. [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2903.04s)]
*  And that's failing. [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2904.48s)]
*  And by the way, I think that is the reason. [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2905.44s)]
*  I don't regret them doing that [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2907.48s)]
*  because it's the reason why podcasts like the mainstream [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2909.16s)]
*  media, this effort to just keep smearing libeling people [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2912.3199999999997s)]
*  for noticing basic human things. [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2915.7799999999997s)]
*  And I don't regret it because I think it's the reason [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2918.3199999999997s)]
*  that trust with them has been fractured. [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2920.16s)]
*  I'm grateful that people no longer believe them. [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2922.2s)]
*  I'm grateful that now people are going [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2924.2599999999998s)]
*  to independent podcasts. [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2925.72s)]
*  And when we go on Spotify, you see like, [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2926.92s)]
*  Tucker Carlson, Candace Owens, [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2928.56s)]
*  that means that for holding on to just like basic human [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2930.2s)]
*  values and being willing to talk about issues in a way [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2934.56s)]
*  and not pretend that your audiences are stupid [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2937.12s)]
*  and not seeing what you're suing, [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2939.44s)]
*  we've earned their trust. [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2941.7599999999998s)]
*  And I don't wanna fumble that ball. [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2944.12s)]
*  Like I wanna always say, even if I don't know something, [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2945.8s)]
*  and sometimes I don't, I can't speak on it, [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2947.84s)]
*  that I don't know everything, but I'm willing to find out [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2949.88s)]
*  before I speak on it or at least have the conversation [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2952.48s)]
*  and not treat you like you're an idiot [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2955.04s)]
*  and I'm like the authority. [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2956.52s)]
*  Yeah, I just can't learn at a fast rate. [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2958.2s)]
*  That's one of my biggest issues, I think. [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2960.3599999999997s)]
*  Speaking about Epstein, right? [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2962.08s)]
*  How do you know he's not just a Jewish guy [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2963.8799999999997s)]
*  who was being perverted or whatever, [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2969.2799999999997s)]
*  and that he was doing business? [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2972.7599999999998s)]
*  Like there's no real connection [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2974.2799999999997s)]
*  that he works for Israel though. [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2975.9199999999996s)]
*  Well, he had passports. [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2977.4399999999996s)]
*  Yeah, so and then it's also his ties to Ghislaine Maxwell, [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2979.12s)]
*  Ghislaine's father, Robert Maxwell, [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2982.2799999999997s)]
*  the whole massade attended his funeral. [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2985.4399999999996s)]
*  He died in very weird circumstances. [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2987.32s)]
*  I don't think even people who are pro-Zionist [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2990.2400000000002s)]
*  would deny that he was obviously [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2995.5600000000004s)]
*  Israeli American intelligence. [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2997.44s)]
*  And he had weird passports. [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=2999.44s)]
*  I mean, he had like a Saudi Arabian passport [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=3001.4s)]
*  and Israeli passport and American passport. [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=3003.6000000000004s)]
*  Oh, he's perv in that. [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=3005.5600000000004s)]
*  Yeah, and under different names, by the way. [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=3006.6000000000004s)]
*  He had working passports of these different countries [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=3008.6400000000003s)]
*  with different names. [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=3011.6400000000003s)]
*  You can't just get that, you know what I mean? [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=3012.84s)]
*  You can't just get these passports [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=3014.76s)]
*  without being connected to the intelligence services. [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=3017.48s)]
*  And it was never made clear why he was so rich. [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=3019.76s)]
*  So who was giving him all that money? [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=3022.44s)]
*  Was this like black ops, our tax dollars going [[00:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=3023.8s)]
*  to give him this illusion of wealth and power [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=3026.28s)]
*  so that he would party with all of these billionaires? [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=3028.48s)]
*  And yes, you're right. [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=3030.28s)]
*  Blackmail operations happen all across the world. [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=3031.44s)]
*  I think America, in terms of just how America's been seized, [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=3033.36s)]
*  that's the only explanation for how Israel's able to expand [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=3037.2400000000002s)]
*  with such a small population. [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=3040.84s)]
*  And somebody has to be fighting their wars. [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=3042.2s)]
*  Somebody has to be funding them. [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=3045.2799999999997s)]
*  We're funding them. [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=3046.3199999999997s)]
*  So I think we've just become like the piggy bank to them. [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=3047.16s)]
*  But if that's the case, what is the cross relationship? [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=3050.0s)]
*  Because yeah, I mean, I think the Middle East [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=3054.0s)]
*  is historically a place that's not super chill, you know? [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=3056.04s)]
*  So that's probably what a lot of people would say is like, [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=3060.7599999999998s)]
*  oh, well, you need an ally there, right? [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=3063.3199999999997s)]
*  Which is so stupid. [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=3065.64s)]
*  I hate when people just say stuff. [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=3066.48s)]
*  One of my things that I always- [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=3067.7999999999997s)]
*  It's a strong theory, though. [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=3069.7599999999998s)]
*  But it's not. [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=3070.7999999999997s)]
*  People just say things that are said all the time. [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=3071.68s)]
*  Why the hell do we have any business [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=3073.96s)]
*  in the Middle East at all? [[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=3075.4s)]
*  Why are you just trying to tell me that I need an ally? [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=3076.24s)]
*  I actually don't. [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=3078.52s)]
*  Why are we involved constantly in Middle East drama? [[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=3081.12s)]
*  Again, this is one of the things that we've just been [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=3084.12s)]
*  programmed since childhood to think that we need to be- [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=3086.2s)]
*  Why are we in Afghanistan? [[00:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=3089.2s)]
*  Let's say the Taliban is terribly corrupt [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=3091.12s)]
*  and they're making women wear- [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=3094.56s)]
*  I would like to mind my business, you know what I mean? [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=3096.96s)]
*  So there's this idea of international expansionism, [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=3099.84s)]
*  international liberalism, everybody must think like us, [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=3103.04s)]
*  live like us. [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=3105.04s)]
*  Really, I'm good if they don't, actually. [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=3105.96s)]
*  I'm cool if Russia wants to decide how Russia lives and if- [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=3109.36s)]
*  Yeah, I agree with that. [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=3112.6400000000003s)]
*  Pakistan wants to decide how Pakistan lives and- [[00:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=3113.48s)]
*  What the fuck do you mean? [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=3115.8s)]
*  Why are we so nosy? [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=3116.6400000000003s)]
*  I actually just, you know, we're next door neighbors. [[00:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=3117.7200000000003s)]
*  Never once have I thought about how you live. [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=3120.52s)]
*  I've never, when I got here, I was like, no. [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=3122.52s)]
*  I've never thought, well, I really think that the morals [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=3124.2400000000002s)]
*  in my house are so good that I just need to go next door [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=3126.6000000000004s)]
*  and force Theovon to live like I live. [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=3129.36s)]
*  And this is what time I wake up, I wake up at 5.30, [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=3131.76s)]
*  and he should get up at 5.30 and he should organize, [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=3134.32s)]
*  you know, the clothes, like I just don't, [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=3136.96s)]
*  I kind of like to mind my business, like a little bit, [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=3138.52s)]
*  if that's possible. [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=3140.8s)]
*  If America could employ that foreign policy for a bit, [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=3141.6400000000003s)]
*  it'd be great. [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=3144.0s)]
*  I agree with that. [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=3144.84s)]
*  That's exactly how I feel. [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=3145.8s)]
*  But I do think that we're so fucked in the Middle East [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=3147.7200000000003s)]
*  because we've started so much. [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=3152.2400000000002s)]
*  You know, we've been just as bad as any other country [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=3154.56s)]
*  as about causing trouble in places, you know? [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=3158.84s)]
*  And for whose benefit? [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=3162.32s)]
*  Who has benefited from that? [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=3164.2000000000003s)]
*  All of the stuff we did in the Middle East [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=3165.1600000000003s)]
*  who's benefited from that? [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=3166.28s)]
*  The answer is Israel, okay? [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=3167.36s)]
*  America has not benefited from any of these wars. [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=3169.1200000000003s)]
*  Why did we just have all of these daughters and sons [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=3171.44s)]
*  dying in the Middle East? [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=3175.0s)]
*  Is America a safer country? [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=3177.8s)]
*  Our borders are wide open. [[00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=3179.28s)]
*  Are we a cleaner country than before we got into these wars? [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=3180.1200000000003s)]
*  Are we, like, do you remember the glory days? [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=3182.48s)]
*  Were you alive in the 90s? [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=3184.2400000000002s)]
*  Things were so chill in the 90s. [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=3185.32s)]
*  I feel like, I always go back to that. [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=3186.76s)]
*  I swear in my 90s, everybody was chill. [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=3189.4s)]
*  We're happy, we're wearing overalls. [[00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=3191.08s)]
*  We were saving up money for Disney [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=3192.68s)]
*  in those big Poland Spring bottles. [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=3194.68s)]
*  At least I was, we were in my house. [[00:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=3197.08s)]
*  And then I just feel like September 11th happened [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=3198.64s)]
*  and we just could not stop being involved in stuff. [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=3201.48s)]
*  And we were told that it was [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=3204.44s)]
*  because it was gonna make us safer. [[00:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=3205.2799999999997s)]
*  And it didn't make us safer. [[00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=3207.52s)]
*  All I know, I don't feel safer when I have to just strip dance [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=3208.6s)]
*  at every airport. [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=3211.92s)]
*  We used to not have to do that as a matter of fact. [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=3213.16s)]
*  Just get on the plane. [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=3215.0s)]
*  Isn't it unbelievable? [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=3215.8399999999997s)]
*  And they never found anybody with a shoe bomb. [[00:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=3217.84s)]
*  It was just this illusion of Middle Eastern terrorism [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=3220.04s)]
*  that made us give up all of our rights. [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=3222.88s)]

*  There wasn't America before we decided [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=3226.92s)]
*  to get involved in everybody's business. [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=3228.7200000000003s)]

*  Well, I'm saying that, I'm talking now [[00:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=3232.4s)]
*  about our Middle Eastern policy. [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=3233.88s)]
*  Right, well yeah, I think we've created so much carnage [[00:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=3235.0s)]
*  over there that now you have children who hate America. [[00:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=3237.1600000000003s)]
*  You have places that hate America. [[00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=3239.92s)]
*  And the sad part I agree with you on is that, yeah, [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=3242.1600000000003s)]
*  the human, regular American people are the ones [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=3245.92s)]
*  that have to sign up for the military [[00:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=3249.0s)]
*  because they either it's tradition in their family [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=3250.56s)]
*  or they wanna support their country [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=3253.4s)]
*  or they don't have a choice [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=3255.12s)]
*  because they're gonna have to go to jail. [[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=3256.92s)]
*  Different reasons, but they're the ones [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=3258.6s)]
*  who have to actually go and die [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=3260.84s)]
*  and be the pawns of these sick governments, right? [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=3263.12s)]
*  And I do think, or these strategic governments. [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=3267.1600000000003s)]
*  Like that's the thing. [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=3269.6800000000003s)]
*  I don't know sometimes if things, [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=3270.52s)]
*  if the governments are, if some of the international politics, [[00:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=3271.6800000000003s)]
*  I don't have an understanding of international politics. [[00:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=3276.52s)]
*  I mean, I have ways that I feel, [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=3278.52s)]
*  but I don't have a strong information well. [[00:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=3279.8399999999997s)]
*  But I do think that it's sad that it's the regular, [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=3282.64s)]
*  just voter that has to go and put their life on the line. [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=3290.8399999999997s)]
*  Right, it's the very same people [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=3293.3599999999997s)]
*  that the mainstream media calls racist, sexist, [[00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=3294.64s)]
*  homophobic and antisemitic. [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=3296.72s)]
*  And then the price you get to pay for that [[00:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=3298.56s)]
*  is that you get to sign up and fight the wars [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=3300.3599999999997s)]
*  so that those little elitists [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=3302.08s)]
*  can write their articles about you. [[00:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=3303.04s)]
*  Like I literally said no one should sign up. [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=3304.56s)]
*  Like under the Biden regime, [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=3307.28s)]
*  I'm like, I would never send my kids to fight in a war [[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=3308.44s)]
*  for a foreign nation when this is a condition of ours. [[00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=3310.96s)]
*  The whole idea of signing up for the military [[00:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=3313.28s)]
*  is you're supposed to be defending the homeland, okay? [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=3315.8s)]
*  Now we're defending Ukraine's borders. [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=3317.6s)]
*  Again, using the same weird argument to try to make you- [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=3319.48s)]
*  That whole Ukraine thing is unbelievable. [[00:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=3321.52s)]
*  Like what are we even doing? [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=3322.84s)]
*  But it's a laundromat. [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=3323.68s)]
*  It's a laundromat. [[00:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=3324.52s)]
*  Look into it historically. [[00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=3325.36s)]
*  Zelensky is a puppet, you know, that's being, [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=3326.2s)]
*  and the use of that was we were running money through Ukraine. [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=3328.72s)]
*  They can't account for the billions of dollars [[00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=3331.84s)]

*  Dan Hooker hurt his hand, so he's out, [[01:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=3696.1s)]

*  So you connect a lot of dots between Israel and media, [[01:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=3735.96s)]
*  but do you think that it's just capitalism? [[01:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=3742.08s)]
*  Don't you think a lot of times it's just business, [[01:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=3744.6s)]
*  and that's how business works, is that, [[01:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=3748.48s)]
*  it's one of the side effects of capitalism? [[01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=3753.52s)]
*  If that were the case, so the reason why this is different [[01:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=3755.7599999999998s)]
*  is because Israel is actually the exception. [[01:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=3757.68s)]
*  They are the only country that's allowed to lobby Americans. [[01:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=3759.88s)]
*  Everyone else has to register as a foreign agent [[01:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=3763.32s)]
*  and under FARA. [[01:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=3767.32s)]
*  Like with APAC or whatever? [[01:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=3768.76s)]
*  Yeah, so APAC, the backstory, by the way, [[01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=3770.0400000000004s)]
*  before JFK got shot, he was fighting APAC. [[01:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=3772.92s)]
*  They were previously called, I'm blanking on this, [[01:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=3775.7200000000003s)]
*  it was, you can look it up, and he was literally saying, [[01:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=3777.84s)]
*  you have to register under the Foreign Act. [[01:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=3781.1600000000003s)]
*  Is that true? [[01:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=3782.92s)]
*  Let's look it up. [[01:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=3783.76s)]
*  1000% sure, and you should look it up. [[01:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=3784.6000000000004s)]
*  We should fact check that live. [[01:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=3785.44s)]
*  He was fighting with what is today known as APAC, [[01:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=3787.7200000000003s)]
*  as was renamed, AZCPA, I don't know what that stood for. [[01:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=3790.28s)]
*  In 1959, AZCPA was renamed APAC, [[01:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=3794.44s)]
*  American Israel Public Affairs Committee, [[01:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=3798.84s)]
*  reflecting a broader membership and mission. [[01:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=3800.96s)]
*  Yeah, so JFK told them that they had to register under FARA. [[01:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=3802.92s)]
*  And so American Zionist Council, [[01:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=3807.6800000000003s)]
*  that's exactly what it was called. [[01:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=3810.2000000000003s)]
*  Okay, American Zionist Council was opposed to a lobby [[01:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=3813.28s)]
*  in the United States founded in 1949. [[01:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=3815.76s)]
*  It represented nine nationwide Zionist organizations [[01:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=3817.68s)]
*  in matters related to- [[01:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=3821.44s)]
*  See at the bottom there, in 1962, [[01:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=3822.2799999999997s)]
*  President, look at the last paragraph, in 1962. [[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=3824.7999999999997s)]
*  In 1962, President John F. Kennedy and his brother Bobby, [[01:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=3826.24s)]
*  as a US Attorney General, [[01:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=3829.0s)]
*  forced the AZC to register as a foreign agent. [[01:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=3830.68s)]
*  In doing so, they were barred [[01:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=3833.3599999999997s)]
*  from making monetary contributions to US officials. [[01:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=3834.6s)]
*  Who was barred, AZC? [[01:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=3837.72s)]
*  Yeah, so APAC, for lack of a better term, [[01:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=3838.8399999999997s)]
*  they were called AZC back then, [[01:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=3840.92s)]
*  but continued to send out newsletters and hold events [[01:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=3842.44s)]
*  with a nonprofit tax exemption. [[01:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=3844.52s)]
*  And then what happened was he was shot. [[01:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=3847.16s)]
*  So he literally, they were writing him letters, [[01:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=3850.44s)]
*  you can find this, this is all like, [[01:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=3852.6s)]
*  this is available information. [[01:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=3854.0s)]
*  And he was like, you need to register, [[01:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=3856.2s)]
*  you need to register, you need to register. [[01:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=3857.52s)]
*  And then we told you to register, [[01:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=3858.7999999999997s)]
*  why are you not registering? [[01:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=3860.88s)]
*  This makes no sense. [[01:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=3861.7599999999998s)]
*  And then APAC got lucky because he got shot and killed. [[01:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=3862.6s)]
*  What also you could- [[01:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=3867.48s)]
*  So they are the only, the reason why I'm bringing this up [[01:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=3868.96s)]
*  is not to further conspiracy theories. [[01:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=3871.44s)]
*  They're the only country? [[01:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=3872.72s)]
*  They're the only country that's allowed [[01:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=3873.68s)]
*  to lobby Americans that are not registered [[01:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=3874.56s)]
*  under the FARA Act. [[01:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=3878.28s)]
*  And so when you see these people- [[01:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=3879.12s)]
*  Under the what act? [[01:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=3879.96s)]
*  FARA, so that's like, if you're a foreign agent, [[01:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=3881.0s)]
*  you have to basically register, [[01:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=3883.52s)]
*  your communications are monitored, all of this stuff. [[01:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=3885.6s)]
*  But for whatever reason, Israel is an exception to this. [[01:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=3888.16s)]
*  And the reason is because JFK got shot, [[01:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=3890.52s)]
*  otherwise they would have been under this. [[01:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=3893.0s)]
*  So that is the reason that they're allowed to do this. [[01:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=3894.2s)]
*  And so, when this, and then of course, [[01:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=3896.32s)]
*  we're not allowed to read the files, [[01:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=3901.36s)]
*  but leading up to his death, [[01:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=3902.36s)]
*  he was having arguments with the Prime Minister, Ben Gurion. [[01:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=3903.32s)]
*  That's a fact, another fact. [[01:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=3906.92s)]
*  He was having heated arguments with Ben Gurion. [[01:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=3908.0400000000004s)]
*  And then the problem, yeah, look it up. [[01:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=3910.1600000000003s)]
*  JFK- [[01:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=3913.4s)]
*  The Foreign Agents Registration Act [[01:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=3914.2400000000002s)]
*  is a US law that requires people in the entities [[01:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=3916.2000000000003s)]
*  working on behalf of foreign governments [[01:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=3918.2400000000002s)]
*  to register with the Department of Justice. [[01:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=3919.6000000000004s)]
*  So it drives me insane to see these absolute frauds. [[01:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=3921.4s)]
*  Like when they go, oh, Russia spent a million, [[01:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=3923.6800000000003s)]
*  or like whatever they said, [[01:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=3927.6000000000004s)]
*  I remember they came out for like Lauren Chen, [[01:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=3928.6800000000003s)]
*  and they're like, there is idea that Russia spent money [[01:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=3930.1200000000003s)]
*  and they'll say something like $26,000. [[01:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=3934.0s)]
*  So they spent $3 million, like, you know, [[01:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=3935.64s)]
*  and influenced the election. [[01:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=3937.6s)]
*  And all of these people will be taking money from APAC. [[01:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=3939.0s)]
*  We're like, oh, well, APAC got lucky. [[01:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=3941.04s)]
*  Well, JFK got shot. [[01:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=3942.56s)]
*  But wasn't the Russia story just, [[01:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=3944.04s)]
*  it was, that was figured out to be a facade, right? [[01:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=3945.2799999999997s)]
*  Right, but when you hear these people [[01:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=3948.3999999999996s)]
*  in your government saying this, [[01:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=3949.92s)]
*  you should know how fraudulent they are [[01:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=3951.04s)]
*  because they all are taking money from Israel. [[01:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=3952.44s)]
*  And so it's like, yes, is Israel doing it legally [[01:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=3954.3999999999996s)]
*  because a president got shot? [[01:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=3956.8799999999997s)]
*  Sure, but it's wrong. [[01:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=3958.3999999999996s)]
*  There should, a country should not be able to lobby [[01:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=3959.7599999999998s)]
*  to get what they want and control our congressmen. [[01:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=3962.36s)]
*  And you get to see them flex that muscle, [[01:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=3965.1200000000003s)]
*  like TikTok and things of nature [[01:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=3967.4s)]
*  when they are now interfering with our speech [[01:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=3969.56s)]
*  and they'll get laws passed really quickly. [[01:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=3971.56s)]
*  It allows a, literally a foreign country [[01:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=3973.52s)]
*  to make decisions in our nation. [[01:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=3976.6s)]
*  Lobbying should just not be allowed full stop. [[01:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=3979.2000000000003s)]
*  So instead they go, oh, well, you're focusing on it [[01:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=3980.76s)]
*  because they're Jewish. [[01:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=3982.6400000000003s)]
*  No, you're just the only country that's allowed to do it. [[01:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=3983.48s)]
*  I would feel the same way of China. [[01:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=3984.84s)]
*  If there was a Chinese lobby that was spending. [[01:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=3986.52s)]
*  Is China allowed to do it? [[01:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=3987.84s)]
*  No, there's no other country that's allowed to do this [[01:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=3989.0s)]
*  but Israel, only APAC. [[01:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=3990.6s)]
*  There's no other country that is, [[01:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=3991.92s)]
*  that everyone else has to register under the FAR Act [[01:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=3993.6800000000003s)]
*  and that changes things significantly. [[01:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=3995.96s)]
*  APAC is the only, you know, American Israel PAC, [[01:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=3998.12s)]
*  whatever it is, that's allowed to spend [[01:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4001.8s)]
*  a hundred million dollars in our elections [[01:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4003.48s)]
*  and not be called names. [[01:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4005.04s)]
*  Like if, can you imagine if Russia spent [[01:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4006.36s)]
*  a hundred million dollars in our elections? [[01:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4007.88s)]
*  If there was like a Russia PAC or a Chinese PAC [[01:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4009.44s)]
*  and they were just allowed to spend that kind of money [[01:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4012.84s)]
*  to lobby and pay our politicians to say things [[01:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4014.56s)]
*  and to believe in things. [[01:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4017.84s)]
*  And that should make people angry. [[01:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4019.12s)]
*  Like that should make people angry and irrespective. [[01:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4021.08s)]
*  Like I said, it could be any country. [[01:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4022.7999999999997s)]
*  Unless, right, I agree with you that it's amazing that. [[01:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4024.12s)]
*  Or let them all do it. [[01:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4028.04s)]
*  Right, if like America is owned by Israel [[01:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4029.16s)]
*  or something or part ownership or whatever, [[01:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4031.44s)]
*  just tell us that. [[01:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4032.92s)]
*  Right, well they don't want to. [[01:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4033.88s)]
*  Like that's a weird thing I don't understand. [[01:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4035.72s)]
*  Like wouldn't. [[01:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4036.92s)]
*  Because then you wouldn't sign up for wars. [[01:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4037.7599999999998s)]
*  You wouldn't, you would start to question things [[01:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4039.2799999999997s)]
*  in a different way. [[01:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4040.92s)]
*  And so it becomes important for the government [[01:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4041.7599999999998s)]
*  to keep Americans ignorant of how Congress works, [[01:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4045.7599999999998s)]
*  what's going on so that they believe their congressman [[01:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4050.0s)]
*  when they go on a rant and say, [[01:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4052.32s)]
*  Israel's our friend and ally. [[01:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4053.76s)]
*  And they don't know how to just very easily look up [[01:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4055.2s)]
*  and see whether this guy's taking money. [[01:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4057.16s)]
*  Or when someone says, [[01:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4058.84s)]
*  this vaccine is going to save your life. [[01:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4060.0s)]
*  And they don't know what's happened with the CDC. [[01:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4061.6s)]
*  People don't even have basic civics understanding, [[01:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4065.72s)]
*  but that's by design. [[01:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4068.32s)]
*  And this is something that my former colleague, [[01:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4069.8s)]
*  Matt Walsh said, and he's so right. [[01:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4071.76s)]
*  Go back and read the letters that were written [[01:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4073.88s)]
*  during the civil war from like poor kid [[01:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4077.4s)]
*  from Tennessee, Alabama, Louisiana, [[01:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4080.92s)]
*  writing to his mom with no formal education. [[01:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4083.4s)]
*  And it sounds like poetry. [[01:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4086.28s)]
*  They were so educated. [[01:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4088.7200000000003s)]
*  17 year olds, I'm talking 17, eight year olds, [[01:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4091.32s)]
*  like talking about how they miss their mothers. [[01:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4093.0s)]
*  And you read these old letters and you're like, [[01:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4094.2400000000002s)]
*  Americans were so educated. [[01:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4096.28s)]
*  There's been an intentional effort to make Americans dumber [[01:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4097.68s)]
*  and dumber and dumber about their own processes, [[01:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4100.68s)]
*  because then it allows for the gaslighting media [[01:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4103.0s)]
*  to come in and sort of make, I mean, you have people now, [[01:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4105.48s)]
*  you look at the, we are factually speaking, [[01:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4108.44s)]
*  getting dumber and dumber every decade. [[01:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4110.599999999999s)]
*  And they fashioned this with the Department of Education, [[01:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4112.2s)]
*  which is now they're going after that too, which is great. [[01:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4114.919999999999s)]
*  Trump is saying like, no more, [[01:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4117.08s)]
*  but you federalized education. [[01:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4119.32s)]
*  And there was a reason for that, [[01:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4120.919999999999s)]
*  because now they can keep you focused [[01:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4121.96s)]
*  on learning about emotional things. [[01:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4123.639999999999s)]
*  Well, we want you to learn about race. [[01:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4125.599999999999s)]
*  We want you to learn about sex. [[01:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4127.32s)]
*  It's very important that we learn about trans rights. [[01:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4128.839999999999s)]
*  And so this is where I think the left and the right get, [[01:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4131.0s)]
*  we're fighting over stuff that's so irrelevant, right? [[01:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4133.72s)]
*  Yeah, a lot of times it's just like, [[01:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4136.280000000001s)]
*  everybody's fighting over bullshit [[01:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4137.52s)]
*  that doesn't super matter. [[01:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4140.0s)]
*  It does matter, but really sometimes just like, [[01:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4141.64s)]
*  select small groups, we get these political kickballs [[01:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4144.72s)]
*  that get kicked around back and forth, [[01:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4147.320000000001s)]
*  and they're the biggest things in the whole world. [[01:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4148.84s)]
*  DLM and like- [[01:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4151.64s)]
*  Like the bathrooms, like, you know. [[01:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4152.96s)]
*  Bathrooms. [[01:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4154.64s)]
*  Bathrooms, like, I'm just saying, [[01:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4155.4800000000005s)]
*  I'm not saying that trans people [[01:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4156.96s)]
*  don't need a place to urinate, everybody does. [[01:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4158.16s)]
*  But I'm just saying, [[01:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4161.16s)]
*  it seems like there's ways to figure it out. [[01:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4162.0s)]
*  I'm from a community where if somebody attacked [[01:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4164.2s)]
*  a gay person or a trans person, [[01:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4166.599999999999s)]
*  you would fuck those people up, right? [[01:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4167.919999999999s)]
*  Like, that's just where I'm from. [[01:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4169.679999999999s)]
*  And also, by the way, we had already solved that. [[01:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4172.16s)]
*  Like, everywhere in the world, [[01:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4174.16s)]
*  it just used to just say bathroom. [[01:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4175.0s)]
*  And we knew that that meant anybody could use it. [[01:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4176.799999999999s)]
*  Do you remember this? [[01:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4178.4s)]
*  And now it's like this issue where they're now writing signs [[01:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4179.24s)]
*  that are like, any person can go here. [[01:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4181.28s)]
*  And I'm like, have you never been on a plane? [[01:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4182.96s)]
*  Do you? [[01:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4185.04s)]
*  Yeah, I know. [[01:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4185.879999999999s)]
*  Everybody just goes in the same bathroom. [[01:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4186.719999999999s)]
*  So it's making- That's a good point, huh? [[01:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4188.2s)]
*  That's how it used to be. [[01:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4190.04s)]
*  But then people bring it, [[01:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4190.879999999999s)]
*  there's always some lurker, [[01:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4192.32s)]
*  some little slurper running around in and out of there, [[01:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4193.48s)]
*  putting on a bow tie or whatever. [[01:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4196.799999999999s)]
*  There's always some little fricking sniff god [[01:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4198.28s)]
*  running his nostril up in there, [[01:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4200.88s)]
*  trying to get a huff of something young, you know? [[01:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4202.759999999999s)]
*  And that's where it gets a little bit dicey, you know? [[01:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4205.28s)]
*  Like at the airport, sometimes when it's a unisex bathroom, [[01:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4207.12s)]
*  you'll see, like I've seen a pair of young girls walk in [[01:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4210.4s)]
*  and then a guy walk in. [[01:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4213.96s)]
*  It seems not cool. [[01:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4215.0s)]
*  Well, I don't mean the big ones. [[01:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4216.0s)]
*  I just mean like when they had the independent stalls, [[01:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4216.96s)]
*  which is just allows a family bathroom. [[01:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4219.719999999999s)]
*  You just go in like one person at a time. [[01:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4221.32s)]
*  Yeah, I'll use the family stall. [[01:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4223.08s)]
*  I'll use the one at the airport and the secret wall [[01:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4224.759999999999s)]
*  just says family or whatever on it. [[01:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4227.08s)]
*  Yeah, it's always cleaner. [[01:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4227.92s)]
*  Always cleaner. [[01:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4228.759999999999s)]
*  I used to go in there and smoke. [[01:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4229.599999999999s)]
*  I'm gonna report you. [[01:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4230.639999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4232.0s)]
*  Sorry. [[01:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4232.84s)]
*  Yeah, no, it's okay. [[01:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4233.679999999999s)]
*  It's fine. [[01:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4234.5199999999995s)]
*  But obviously you like, you're in conspiracy theories. [[01:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4235.5599999999995s)]
*  I'm just into the truth. [[01:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4241.08s)]
*  And as soon as you start following the truth, [[01:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4242.36s)]
*  they call you a conspiracy theorist. [[01:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4244.28s)]
*  But like I said, I'm comfortable with it. [[01:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4245.5199999999995s)]
*  I literally sell stuff that says conspiracy theorists. [[01:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4247.4s)]
*  And my whole mission is to make people realize [[01:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4249.68s)]
*  dweebs are calling you names and you're, I don't know, [[01:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4252.8s)]
*  like you just gotta stand up to them. [[01:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4255.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4256.360000000001s)]
*  You called me a conspiracy theorist [[01:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4257.200000000001s)]
*  for talking about vaccines for years [[01:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4258.240000000001s)]
*  and then COVID happened. [[01:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4259.84s)]
*  And suddenly people are all looking at my old series [[01:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4261.08s)]
*  and going, wow, well, if they could lie about COVID, [[01:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4263.84s)]
*  did they lie about other stuff? [[01:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4266.0s)]
*  Yeah, buddy. [[01:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4266.92s)]
*  You're looking at a drug cartel. [[01:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4267.92s)]
*  Yeah, they're gonna lie to you. [[01:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4269.200000000001s)]
*  They know some things. [[01:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4270.240000000001s)]
*  I think things start to feel super obvious [[01:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4271.72s)]
*  to a lot of Americans that there's, [[01:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4273.76s)]
*  it's just been that we are being laundered. [[01:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4276.08s)]
*  Right? Of course. [[01:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4279.44s)]
*  We are the things are, [[01:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4280.28s)]
*  but then you start to, then it gets to a personal level. [[01:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4282.36s)]
*  It's like, do some people even really care? [[01:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4285.2s)]
*  I know there's a part of people inside of their spirit [[01:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4287.76s)]
*  that probably really cares for most people. [[01:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4289.96s)]
*  But then it's like, how do you uncompromise [[01:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4292.4s)]
*  and unaddict yourself from the easy things [[01:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4296.5599999999995s)]
*  to want to spurn yourself towards action, right? [[01:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4300.4s)]
*  Well, let me say this. [[01:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4306.8s)]
*  How do you keep like, [[01:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4307.64s)]
*  cause you got anti-Semite of the year, whatever, [[01:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4308.76s)]
*  decade or whatever it was. [[01:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4311.76s)]
*  But like, cause I don't like what Israel, [[01:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4313.68s)]
*  like their space in Gaza, right? [[01:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4319.0s)]
*  Like that to me is just like seem super tyrannical. [[01:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4321.36s)]
*  But didn't they just come up with the thing today [[01:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4325.32s)]
*  about the ICC, they can't prosecute Netanyahu? [[01:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4326.96s)]
*  Yeah, because he runs shit. [[01:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4330.2s)]
*  Is that today? [[01:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4332.16s)]
*  He's like the ultimate grand gangster. [[01:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4333.0s)]
*  He's like, even when they catch him doing the crimes [[01:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4334.8s)]
*  and we created this court for exactly what it did, [[01:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4336.8s)]
*  they said, you can't do this. [[01:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4339.16s)]
*  Then they say, well, just cancel the courts. [[01:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4341.08s)]
*  You imagine being like that much of a worldwide gangster? [[01:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4342.8s)]
*  It's crazy. [[01:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4345.76s)]
*  Right, and I wish they would just say, [[01:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4346.64s)]
*  look, we're still letting everybody be gangsters [[01:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4348.0s)]
*  because that's what I don't like about the media [[01:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4350.400000000001s)]
*  a lot of times. [[01:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4352.04s)]
*  There's this thing, it's like, [[01:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4352.88s)]
*  we all need to look out for each other [[01:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4354.400000000001s)]
*  and we need like climate change [[01:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4356.88s)]
*  and we need to make sure that everybody has a safe place [[01:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4359.56s)]
*  to urinate and all those things. [[01:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4362.96s)]
*  Which yeah, I think all those things are important [[01:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4365.6s)]
*  or worth discussion. [[01:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4367.76s)]
*  But at the same time, you'll have countries [[01:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4369.16s)]
*  that are still playing this Fidel Castro type of role. [[01:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4371.4800000000005s)]
*  So it's like, why do we keep saying [[01:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4375.4400000000005s)]
*  all these little things are important, [[01:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4377.92s)]
*  but you can just say, hey, we're still in colonial [[01:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4379.360000000001s)]
*  or we're still in the old school days [[01:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4382.88s)]
*  and shit is what it is. [[01:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4384.72s)]
*  So fucking mark off your fence yard [[01:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4386.280000000001s)]
*  and protect your fucking shit. [[01:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4388.4800000000005s)]
*  Because that's what countries are doing. [[01:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4390.08s)]
*  Like that's how they're operating, [[01:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4392.4800000000005s)]
*  to create ambiance that makes us feel like [[01:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4394.12s)]
*  we can't operate like that [[01:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4396.68s)]
*  or you're a bad person if you do operate like that. [[01:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4398.04s)]
*  Right, they're actually morally pretentious. [[01:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4400.16s)]
*  They're pretending it's like, oh, we've just gotten, [[01:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4402.0s)]
*  we're so dignified, we would never do this. [[01:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4404.68s)]
*  Look, if it's the rules of the jungle, [[01:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4406.68s)]
*  it's the rules of the jungle, let us know. [[01:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4408.12s)]
*  Right, that's my biggest thing. [[01:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4409.5599999999995s)]
*  It's this illusion of we're better, we would never, [[01:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4411.12s)]
*  oh, because of World War II, you're doing all of it. [[01:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4414.12s)]
*  You're violating every single one of these codes [[01:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4417.04s)]
*  that you put into place [[01:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4419.16s)]
*  and if you're gonna do it because I'm big and you're small, [[01:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4420.0s)]
*  then say that. [[01:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4422.8s)]
*  The small guys know what's up, [[01:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4424.08s)]
*  it's the rules of the jungle. [[01:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4425.88s)]
*  That's my thing. [[01:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4426.84s)]
*  I just wanna know what the rules are. [[01:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4427.76s)]
*  If America is owned by China and Israel and Taiwan, [[01:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4429.56s)]
*  just tell me that. [[01:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4435.56s)]
*  Let me know, because at a certain point, [[01:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4436.88s)]
*  if you keep, you know. [[01:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4442.92s)]
*  What you're talking about, by the way, [[01:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4444.56s)]
*  there's a term for it, it's called real politicking. [[01:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4445.64s)]
*  Real politicking? [[01:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4447.6s)]
*  Yeah, so I did a foreign policy paper. [[01:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4448.4400000000005s)]
*  I'd rather know that we're working with cartels [[01:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4451.6s)]
*  in South America, because we are, right? [[01:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4453.88s)]
*  And that's cool, CIA, whatever, [[01:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4455.68s)]
*  but just please stop the pretentious, oh, your face. [[01:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4458.120000000001s)]
*  Oof, oof. [[01:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4461.320000000001s)]
*  Yeah, that scoffing. [[01:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4462.64s)]
*  That's the American government. [[01:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4463.4800000000005s)]
*  It's the scoffing. [[01:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4464.320000000001s)]
*  We would never, yes, you would, yes, you have, [[01:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4465.160000000001s)]
*  and yes, you are. [[01:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4468.360000000001s)]
*  And people that know real politicking. [[01:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4469.4800000000005s)]
*  Let me look at real politicking. [[01:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4472.200000000001s)]
*  Is the approach of conducting [[01:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4474.200000000001s)]
*  diplomatic or political policies [[01:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4475.6s)]
*  based primarily on considerations of given circumstances [[01:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4476.92s)]
*  and factors rather than strictly following [[01:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4479.96s)]
*  ideological, moral, or ethical premises. [[01:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4481.64s)]
*  Right, and so if they're like, yeah, here's the thing, [[01:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4483.4s)]
*  cartels are getting big in the South. [[01:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4485.12s)]
*  And so, yeah, morally, we shouldn't work with the cartels, [[01:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4487.0s)]
*  but also, if we let the cartels keep growing [[01:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4489.72s)]
*  and El Chapo keep growing, then you know what? [[01:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4492.32s)]
*  Then Mexico could become stronger than us, [[01:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4494.52s)]
*  so we're gonna do deals with the cartel. [[01:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4496.08s)]
*  Like, that's real politicking, right? [[01:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4497.24s)]
*  Or say, yeah, we're part, Israel is, [[01:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4498.84s)]
*  we are partners to the end, and this is how it is. [[01:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4501.96s)]
*  The problem is, I think you used to be able to do that, [[01:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4505.12s)]
*  but the news decided to not be the news anymore. [[01:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4507.08s)]
*  It decided to be like not real, you know? [[01:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4510.92s)]
*  Well, because the CIA purchased them, right? [[01:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4515.32s)]
*  And that's a fact. [[01:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4517.12s)]
*  Again, you could pull this up [[01:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4518.0s)]
*  so that we get into conspiracy theory. [[01:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4519.12s)]
*  What is Operation Mockingbird? [[01:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4520.72s)]
*  The CIA, after JFK was shot, which is just the fact. [[01:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4522.28s)]
*  Please look it up, because I'm gonna sound crazy [[01:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4526.4s)]
*  if you don't look up Operation Mockingbird, [[01:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4527.8s)]
*  but everything happens after JFK gets shot. [[01:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4530.04s)]
*  I'm never gonna work again, but let's look at [[01:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4533.2s)]
*  Operation Mockingbird. It's fine, no. [[01:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4534.96s)]
*  This is on Wikipedia, so we're not even, [[01:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4536.04s)]
*  we're not on Reddit feeds here, you know what I mean? [[01:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4537.68s)]
*  Everything I'm showing you is on Wikipedia, [[01:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4539.08s)]
*  so it means they've admitted it. [[01:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4540.400000000001s)]
*  Operation Mockingbird is an alleged [[01:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4541.84s)]
*  yard-scale program at the United States [[01:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4543.08s)]

*  for propaganda purposes. [[01:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4551.360000000001s)]
*  And where were they from? [[01:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4553.28s)]
*  1963, they're at the bottom. [[01:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4554.84s)]
*  So it's just a group of Americans? [[01:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4556.84s)]
*  No, the CIA just paid American journalists [[01:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4558.24s)]
*  to say what they wanted to. [[01:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4560.28s)]
*  Operation Mockingbird, right? [[01:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4561.12s)]
*  So that you and I are taking money from the CIA, [[01:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4562.4800000000005s)]
*  this would be the theory, [[01:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4564.400000000001s)]
*  and they're paying us, yeah, if we're journalists. [[01:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4566.12s)]
*  And so then our job is to be like, [[01:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4567.759999999999s)]
*  gaslight the American people. [[01:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4570.08s)]
*  So let's say the CIA was involved in shooting JFK, right? [[01:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4571.5199999999995s)]
*  Okay, well that kind of is what I believe [[01:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4574.639999999999s)]
*  as a conspiracy theorist. [[01:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4576.759999999999s)]
*  But don't listen to me, I'm a conspiracy theorist. [[01:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4578.08s)]
*  I believe the CIA was involved, [[01:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4580.24s)]
*  and so the next thing you have to do, [[01:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4581.28s)]
*  if the population's freaking out, [[01:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4583.12s)]
*  what's going on, what's going on, [[01:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4584.719999999999s)]
*  okay, they start putting journalists on payroll [[01:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4586.2s)]
*  and they're supposed to gaslight you [[01:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4588.28s)]
*  and be like, this is a closed case, [[01:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4589.44s)]
*  the matter has been closed. [[01:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4590.919999999999s)]
*  JFK tripped and fell, and that's how he died. [[01:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4592.28s)]
*  And anybody saying anything else is a conspiracy theorist. [[01:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4596.4s)]
*  Also a fun fact, the term conspiracy theorist [[01:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4598.639999999999s)]
*  was created by the CIA. [[01:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4601.24s)]
*  It's literally a gaslighting, [[01:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4602.24s)]
*  it's a word that's used to gaslight you. [[01:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4603.719999999999s)]
*  And so I've fallen in love with going back [[01:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4605.4s)]
*  and learning real history and recognizing [[01:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4607.839999999999s)]
*  that these public school classrooms, which I grew up in, [[01:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4609.48s)]
*  were meant to program me and to social engineer me. [[01:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4612.96s)]
*  And so to find like, historians, [[01:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4615.719999999999s)]
*  if you want to know why people react the way that they do [[01:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4617.639999999999s)]
*  when Tucker has on like a Daryl Cooper, [[01:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4619.4s)]
*  or somebody that's deep in, [[01:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4621.4s)]
*  and I think what's happening in the world [[01:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4623.12s)]
*  is that the reason why people are so angry [[01:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4624.36s)]
*  about what happened in the world [[01:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4625.92s)]
*  is because they are the mockingbirds, right? [[01:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4627.0s)]
*  They are freaking out because this is now failing. [[01:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4629.88s)]
*  There has never been any indication [[01:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4633.16s)]
*  that Operation Mockingbird has ended. [[01:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4634.6s)]
*  In fact, it is known that Barack Obama [[01:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4637.24s)]
*  reinstituted Project Mockingbird. [[01:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4640.64s)]
*  And so you have to know these things. [[01:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4642.72s)]
*  You have to, you can look at a Project Mockingbird Obama. [[01:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4644.68s)]
*  But did you write the article that's out there? [[01:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4648.72s)]
*  No, they would never let me be an editor. [[01:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4650.32s)]
*  I won anti-Semite of the year. [[01:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4653.4400000000005s)]
*  There's no way they're letting me do anything ever [[01:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4654.280000000001s)]
*  on like anything government stuff. [[01:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4656.08s)]
*  They've put me on the ADL list. [[01:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4659.64s)]
*  They've tried to smear and libel me [[01:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4660.96s)]
*  into like a ridiculous way to make it, [[01:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4662.16s)]
*  I mean, they say I'm literally Adolf Hitler. [[01:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4664.280000000001s)]
*  I'm Adolf, I'm the new, I'm the second coming [[01:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4667.2s)]
*  I've read somewhere. [[01:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4669.72s)]
*  Well, at least they casted a black Hitler this time. [[01:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4670.92s)]
*  I feel like that's cool, right? [[01:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4672.84s)]
*  Like that's good for DEI or whatever. [[01:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4673.92s)]
*  Here's my question. [[01:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4676.08s)]
*  I'm so nice. [[01:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4680.96s)]
*  I'm way too pregnant. [[01:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4681.84s)]
*  This is crazy. [[01:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4682.96s)]
*  No, you're all right. [[01:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4683.92s)]
*  I just need a break. [[01:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4684.76s)]
*  This is too much for my brain today. [[01:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4685.6s)]
*  But how do you keep like, [[01:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4687.6s)]
*  how do you keep your Jewish friends [[01:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4691.4400000000005s)]
*  but have issues with like Israel and stuff like that? [[01:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4694.2s)]
*  How do you manage that? [[01:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4696.52s)]
*  I haven't, not even one Jewish friendship has ended [[01:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4697.6s)]
*  because it's very weird. [[01:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4700.52s)]
*  Like the purpose of these advocacy groups. [[01:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4703.08s)]
*  And Jewish agents set this up today too, I wanna know. [[01:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4704.92s)]
*  Yeah, but that's the point. [[01:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4707.08s)]
*  Once you know people, they're not gonna fall. [[01:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4708.2s)]
*  I grew up in a very Jewish town. [[01:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4711.6s)]
*  I grew up just outside of New York City. [[01:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4713.12s)]
*  And all my best friends growing up were Jewish, [[01:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4714.72s)]
*  just happened to be the way that it was. [[01:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4717.4800000000005s)]
*  And so like, you're not gonna convince them, [[01:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4718.6s)]
*  these people that like, I was at the Rosh Hashanah dinner, [[01:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4720.320000000001s)]
*  like I know Jewish prayers. [[01:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4722.24s)]
*  And the Jewish families that I worked for in New York [[01:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4724.24s)]
*  overnight that can is turned into Adolf Hitler. [[01:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4727.04s)]
*  Like that actually is being sold. [[01:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4729.320000000001s)]
*  That's a good point. [[01:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4731.16s)]
*  Which is like, they're not gonna buy that. [[01:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4732.0s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4733.320000000001s)]
*  So it's stupid. [[01:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4734.16s)]
*  But the other thing is that they haven't yet worked through. [[01:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4735.0s)]
*  I think this new generation of smear tactics, [[01:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4736.68s)]
*  like the people that are employing it now, [[01:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4741.96s)]
*  people like Barry Weiss, [[01:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4743.400000000001s)]
*  they haven't quite figured out that [[01:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4745.64s)]
*  once people have a platform that's big, [[01:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4747.0s)]
*  like if people are watching your show every single day, [[01:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4748.68s)]
*  and I say, actually Theo Vonn isn't a vowed racist. [[01:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4750.8s)]
*  Like he is the second coming of whoever. [[01:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4754.6s)]
*  You know, he just wants slavery back. [[01:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4757.68s)]
*  You're not just condemning Theo Vonn. [[01:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4759.52s)]
*  You're condemning the millions of people that listen to him. [[01:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4762.160000000001s)]
*  And they get mad. [[01:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4764.76s)]
*  Because they know you're basically, [[01:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4765.72s)]
*  they're gonna be like, I listen to his show every day. [[01:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4767.0s)]
*  What are you talking about? [[01:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4768.56s)]
*  Like he says, raisins are, [[01:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4769.400000000001s)]
*  you like raisins because they're grapes [[01:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4772.72s)]
*  that have been through shit. [[01:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4774.52s)]
*  That's a Theo Vonn quote. [[01:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4775.360000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I would never do slavery, dude. [[01:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4776.52s)]
*  I can barely, I have fucking three employees [[01:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4777.92s)]
*  I can barely handle these guys. [[01:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4779.56s)]
*  But if I had advocacy groups and tons of money, [[01:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4780.400000000001s)]
*  I could just be like, write articles [[01:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4782.240000000001s)]
*  that say Theo Vonn hates black people. [[01:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4783.4400000000005s)]
*  Okay, we could do it. [[01:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4785.320000000001s)]
*  But at the end of the day, [[01:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4786.16s)]
*  people that listen to you know better and they get angry. [[01:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4787.12s)]
*  And all it does is it breaks them away [[01:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4789.08s)]
*  from trusting the mainstream media more [[01:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4791.0s)]
*  because they are listening to you every day. [[01:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4792.4800000000005s)]
*  So I have the confidence in my followers. [[01:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4794.08s)]
*  They know me, they know who I am. [[01:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4796.0s)]
*  I don't hate anybody. [[01:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4797.72s)]
*  I just hate liars. [[01:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4798.5599999999995s)]
*  And they come in all different shapes and sizes [[01:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4799.4s)]
*  and races and religions. [[01:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4801.12s)]
*  You can find you a liar anywhere. [[01:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4802.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4805.24s)]
*  Well, I do think, [[01:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4806.24s)]
*  because there's also a lot of great things that I see [[01:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4807.08s)]
*  like in like a lot of Jewish families, [[01:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4808.64s)]
*  they value education. [[01:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4810.32s)]
*  They invest in their children. [[01:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4812.32s)]
*  Those are like some of the things that they do super well. [[01:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4814.16s)]
*  They work together, right? [[01:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4817.08s)]
*  Like a lot of Jewish guys that I know they'll connect you [[01:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4818.72s)]
*  with another Jewish guy to work with or something. [[01:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4820.72s)]
*  They help their group. [[01:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4824.4400000000005s)]
*  And that's something that I feel like other groups [[01:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4826.52s)]
*  could learn how to do as well. [[01:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4828.2s)]
*  That's something that I think a lot of people. [[01:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4829.96s)]
*  I learned my work ethic I got from two Jewish men. [[01:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4832.280000000001s)]
*  I worked in private equity for four and a half years. [[01:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4834.400000000001s)]
*  Oh really? [[01:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4837.4400000000005s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4838.280000000001s)]
*  In municipal bonds? [[01:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4839.12s)]
*  Not in municipal bonds, in private equity. [[01:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4839.96s)]
*  I just got into some. [[01:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4841.96s)]
*  Mm-hmm. [[01:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4842.8s)]
*  What do you mean it's going good? [[01:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4845.64s)]
*  It's set, set percent. [[01:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4846.4800000000005s)]
*  Yeah, so they pretty much like, [[01:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4848.16s)]
*  you can't live in New York City and hate Jews. [[01:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4850.400000000001s)]
*  They're literally everywhere. [[01:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4852.48s)]
*  But that's kind of been one of the worst things [[01:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4854.32s)]
*  about the politicizing of this [[01:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4856.28s)]
*  is exactly what you're talking about. [[01:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4858.08s)]
*  My perception of Jewish people is having being someone [[01:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4859.5199999999995s)]
*  who grew up in New York, but they work hard, they grind, [[01:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4862.04s)]
*  they fight, they love. [[01:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4864.839999999999s)]
*  You can get into an argument with them. [[01:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4865.959999999999s)]
*  They don't take themselves seriously. [[01:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4867.639999999999s)]
*  You can say whatever and then be out to dinner. [[01:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4869.36s)]
*  And to see the branding of that now, [[01:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4871.5199999999995s)]
*  like this like victim mentality, I don't recognize this. [[01:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4875.839999999999s)]
*  This whiny. [[01:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4878.639999999999s)]
*  What do you mean, victim mentality? [[01:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4879.48s)]
*  Well, now when everything's become political, [[01:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4880.32s)]
*  it becomes like the DC version. [[01:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4882.5199999999995s)]
*  And this is why I also hated the BLM [[01:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4884.5199999999995s)]
*  because black people are like very funny, [[01:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4886.759999999999s)]
*  have a good sense of humor. [[01:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4888.44s)]
*  You can always just like make a joke. [[01:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4889.679999999999s)]
*  And that's kind of like, that's what our culture is. [[01:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4892.16s)]
*  And then BLM turned black people into like victims, [[01:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4895.44s)]
*  like racism's everywhere. [[01:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4897.599999999999s)]
*  And it's in the way that that person's braiding their hair. [[01:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4898.84s)]
*  It's the form of whatever they're learning in school, [[01:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4901.84s)]
*  weird terms, cultural appropriation. [[01:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4903.799999999999s)]
*  And I'm like, it turns into wimps. [[01:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4906.2s)]
*  Like this was our cool thing was we were funny [[01:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4907.2s)]
*  and we could take a joke and mock people for being, [[01:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4909.32s)]
*  white, redneck, Chinese. [[01:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4912.599999999999s)]
*  That's the cool thing. [[01:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4914.719999999999s)]
*  And when you remove that, and then suddenly it's like [[01:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4916.0s)]
*  hysteria and you're like, I'm a victim and everybody's in. [[01:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4918.24s)]
*  It's like, you're not fun anymore. [[01:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4920.28s)]
*  You suck and I hate you because you suck, [[01:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4921.88s)]
*  not because of your race, [[01:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4923.5199999999995s)]
*  whether you're black, Jewish or white. [[01:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4924.599999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I think America is just, [[01:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4928.12s)]
*  I mean, we still haven't even dealt with, [[01:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4931.28s)]
*  I think the trauma from like the native Americans [[01:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4932.92s)]
*  that were in our land. [[01:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4935.32s)]
*  I think we still have a lot of like, [[01:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4936.16s)]
*  like repairing to do, you know? [[01:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4938.88s)]
*  I think we're still repairing. [[01:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4941.639999999999s)]
*  We just need more comedians. [[01:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4943.04s)]
*  I don't care about your feelings. [[01:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4944.28s)]
*  I just wanna make fun of you. [[01:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4945.24s)]
*  Please, can we all just make fun of each other? [[01:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4946.12s)]
*  If you go back to like, let's say the 90s. [[01:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4947.5599999999995s)]
*  Oh yeah, that shit was great. [[01:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4949.32s)]
*  And Chris Rock was up on stage [[01:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4950.5599999999995s)]
*  and he's just making fun of you for every issue you have. [[01:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4952.12s)]
*  And by the time you walk out of there, [[01:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4955.5199999999995s)]
*  you're all laughing at each other [[01:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4956.88s)]
*  and you realize that your shit stinks [[01:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4958.8s)]
*  and your dog does poop, ma'am, you know? [[01:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4961.4s)]
*  Oof. [[01:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4964.08s)]
*  Think, I know, that lady scoffed at me [[01:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4965.04s)]
*  when I fell out of that chair at the inauguration. [[01:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4967.12s)]
*  She's like, oh, oh. [[01:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4968.68s)]
*  Like I had fucking, like I was a fart [[01:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4972.36s)]
*  that had come out of her. [[01:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4974.2s)]
*  Oh, look at this gross, [[01:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4976.6s)]
*  this thing from steerage that climbed up here somehow. [[01:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4979.8s)]
*  This thing that would never get in a lifeboat [[01:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4984.24s)]
*  on the Titanic, you know, that kind of fucking. [[01:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4985.92s)]
*  Yeah, when I fell out of that chair at the inauguration, [[01:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4989.64s)]
*  that's what she was doing. [[01:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4991.2s)]
*  What else do I wanna ask you about? [[01:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4993.4800000000005s)]
*  Okay, so you have, let's get in, [[01:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4994.64s)]
*  I can't even handle anything else serious right now. [[01:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4996.72s)]
*  You have a conspiracy theory about Brigitte Macron, right? [[01:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=4999.160000000001s)]
*  Or it's a conspiracy theory. [[01:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5003.160000000001s)]
*  And look, I was, we were one of the first podcasts [[01:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5004.08s)]
*  that had Bobby Kennedy on because he's a friend of mine, [[01:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5007.84s)]
*  right? [[01:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5010.280000000001s)]
*  So he came on and he even said, [[01:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5011.120000000001s)]
*  dude, I don't know if I should be on, right? [[01:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5013.120000000001s)]
*  And then fast forward three years later, five years later, [[01:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5015.68s)]
*  and he is, and now those people are like, [[01:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5019.6s)]
*  Bobby's the fucking man, you know? [[01:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5022.48s)]
*  So I understand like, you know, conspiracy theories [[01:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5024.599999999999s)]
*  and also just being brave to have somebody on. [[01:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5027.879999999999s)]
*  Like I was like, some people might be afraid [[01:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5030.16s)]
*  to have Candace Owens on. [[01:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5031.839999999999s)]
*  I was like, I wanna be, [[01:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5032.719999999999s)]
*  I don't want anybody telling me that I can [[01:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5034.5199999999995s)]
*  or can't talk to somebody. [[01:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5037.24s)]
*  Like that to me feels really good. [[01:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5038.96s)]
*  Now I'll admit probably I'm not the best [[01:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5040.639999999999s)]
*  in this conversation of like some of the topics. [[01:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5043.48s)]
*  I'll probably get scared or I don't know enough information, [[01:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5045.48s)]
*  right? [[01:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5048.5599999999995s)]
*  But that's always something that I kind of struggle with. [[01:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5049.4s)]
*  And so sometimes I let things be said [[01:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5052.599999999999s)]
*  where it's like I don't fact check them, [[01:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5054.759999999999s)]
*  but sometimes I just forget, you know? [[01:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5055.799999999999s)]
*  I'm not a fucking wizard either. [[01:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5057.24s)]
*  You know, I don't even know what the fuck I'm doing. [[01:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5059.36s)]
*  So I work hard at it though. [[01:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5062.08s)]
*  You fucking better believe that. [[01:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5064.2s)]
*  People are like, you know what the fuck you're doing? [[01:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5065.799999999999s)]
*  I'm like, yeah, but I'll be there every fucking day. [[01:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5067.08s)]
*  That's exactly who I am. [[01:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5070.36s)]
*  That's why people like you. [[01:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5071.2s)]
*  You're never figured it out. [[01:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5072.24s)]
*  I never figured it out. [[01:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5073.759999999999s)]
*  You're exceptional at being average. [[01:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5074.599999999999s)]
*  Like average meaning like relatable. [[01:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5076.599999999999s)]
*  Oh, thanks, yeah. [[01:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5078.2s)]
*  That is what you're exceptional at [[01:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5079.04s)]
*  is people feel like they can listen to you [[01:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5080.04s)]
*  and they can understand that they can think with you. [[01:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5083.28s)]
*  And I think we've disrupted, [[01:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5085.08s)]
*  and I'm putting myself in the same box here, [[01:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5087.08s)]
*  like we've disrupted this model of lecturing the listeners [[01:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5089.8s)]
*  that they had going on for years. [[01:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5092.76s)]
*  We are CNN. [[01:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5094.56s)]
*  We know we will tell you what to think. [[01:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5095.5199999999995s)]
*  Do you get lectury though? [[01:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5097.36s)]
*  No, not on my show. [[01:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5098.6s)]
*  Do you watch my podcast? [[01:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5099.44s)]
*  I've seen your podcast before. [[01:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5100.28s)]

*  And then you get creative and you create these. [[01:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5108.36s)]
*  Timelines and stuff. [[01:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5112.759999999999s)]
*  I'm a psycho. [[01:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5113.92s)]

*  That's the difference between us two. [[01:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5115.96s)]
*  I'm a woman, so it's gotta be organized. [[01:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5117.24s)]
*  I gotta be like the kids, [[01:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5118.92s)]
*  I gotta put their clothes out. [[01:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5121.28s)]
*  Same thing for my podcast. [[01:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5123.24s)]
*  I'm like, let me tell you what happened. [[01:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5124.2s)]
*  Look at this timeline. [[01:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5125.5599999999995s)]
*  Have you faced legal issues? [[01:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5126.5599999999995s)]
*  Have you been sued? [[01:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5127.92s)]
*  I have been sued. [[01:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5128.92s)]
*  I have indeed been sued, [[01:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5129.799999999999s)]
*  but have I been beat in a lawsuit? [[01:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5131.12s)]
*  No. [[01:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5133.639999999999s)]
*  And do you have to have a lawyer on staff? [[01:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5135.0s)]
*  No, but I have a lawyer that is like, [[01:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5140.2s)]
*  he's basically my friend. [[01:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5142.24s)]
*  He's become like a brother. [[01:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5143.679999999999s)]
*  We get all sorts of crazy letters. [[01:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5146.12s)]
*  We get much more threats to be sued [[01:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5147.48s)]
*  in terms of actual lawsuits. [[01:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5149.5599999999995s)]
*  I've only gone to court with two people. [[01:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5151.28s)]
*  One, won them both. [[01:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5156.919999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I was just curious. [[01:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5160.2s)]
*  And what about cybersecurity? [[01:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5161.04s)]
*  I noticed that you have this Brigitte Macron, [[01:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5163.08s)]
*  who is the wife of the president of France. [[01:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5166.360000000001s)]
*  His name is Emmanuel Macron. [[01:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5171.360000000001s)]
*  And one thing that's interesting about them [[01:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5173.400000000001s)]
*  is they have an age difference, right? [[01:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5174.88s)]
*  How many years is it? [[01:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5176.2s)]
*  How many years? [[01:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5177.32s)]
*  Do they tell people or how many years is it actually? [[01:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5178.16s)]
*  Wow, that's how it goes. [[01:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5179.68s)]
*  If you haven't watched the series, [[01:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5183.76s)]
*  I mean, there's a reason it's going to happen. [[01:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5185.12s)]
*  I've watched two episodes of the series. [[01:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5185.96s)]
*  It's crazy. [[01:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5187.52s)]
*  This is not like, this wasn't nothing. [[01:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5188.360000000001s)]
*  And I wanna be clear. [[01:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5190.0s)]
*  I wasn't the one who, I happened upon this [[01:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5191.08s)]
*  because I'm one of these rare birds, [[01:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5192.84s)]
*  because I'm nosy, [[01:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5194.5199999999995s)]
*  that if I see something happening in another country, [[01:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5195.96s)]
*  I will take the time to pick it up in the foreign language [[01:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5199.04s)]
*  and then interpret it into English [[01:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5202.68s)]
*  and to try to read and understand it. [[01:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5204.28s)]
*  And most people just will be like, [[01:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5206.04s)]
*  I don't really care. [[01:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5207.4s)]
*  It's happening in France, it's happening in Romania, [[01:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5208.24s)]
*  it's happening wherever. [[01:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5209.44s)]
*  I just make time, I get interested. [[01:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5210.96s)]
*  And so Savannah, who's my manager, [[01:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5212.16s)]
*  remembers the night at the UFC fight [[01:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5214.8s)]
*  where I found the reporting on this. [[01:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5216.96s)]
*  And actually the way it popped up [[01:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5218.96s)]
*  was like the Daily Mail actually did a piece [[01:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5220.36s)]
*  on Brigitte Macron. [[01:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5222.679999999999s)]
*  It was just funny to me because they were like, [[01:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5223.719999999999s)]
*  Emmanuel Macron angrily denies the rumors, [[01:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5225.24s)]
*  his wife's a man. [[01:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5228.759999999999s)]
*  And he was like all stressed out and was like, [[01:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5229.599999999999s)]
*  it's not true, it's not true. [[01:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5231.24s)]
*  And I'm like, I was just like, [[01:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5232.48s)]
*  what the heck is going on in France? [[01:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5233.599999999999s)]
*  Like the president has to come out [[01:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5234.92s)]
*  and make a statement on this at all. [[01:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5237.08s)]
*  Well, this is a story that's come up over the years [[01:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5238.599999999999s)]
*  like this is an alleged thing. [[01:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5240.5599999999995s)]
*  But what was weird about the Daily Mail piece- [[01:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5243.12s)]
*  But in 10 minutes, can you give me what is going on here? [[01:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5244.88s)]
*  Yeah, so what was weird about the Daily Mail piece [[01:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5248.08s)]
*  is that they didn't debunk what the people were saying. [[01:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5251.0s)]
*  And this should be such an easy thing to debunk. [[01:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5252.76s)]
*  Like if you were like canisoned as a man [[01:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5254.24s)]
*  and never grew up in Stamford, [[01:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5255.639999999999s)]
*  I'd be like yearbook, yearbook, yearbook, yearbook, yearbook, [[01:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5257.76s)]
*  here's me and my family. [[01:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5259.84s)]
*  She's like, it's such an easy thing to debunk. [[01:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5261.2s)]
*  Like why is this going on for years? [[01:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5262.28s)]
*  And so that's what caught my attention, looked into it. [[01:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5263.92s)]
*  And 1000%, she was born a man, lived as a man for 30 years, [[01:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5265.92s)]
*  and then transitioned at some time in the 80s. [[01:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5269.76s)]
*  What are you worried about getting in trouble [[01:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5272.88s)]
*  for slander by saying that? [[01:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5274.28s)]
*  I have welcomed the lawsuit. [[01:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5275.639999999999s)]
*  I mean, Emmanuel Macron sent me a threat before we published [[01:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5276.96s)]
*  and we went back to him. [[01:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5279.32s)]
*  Did he sign it or whatever? [[01:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5280.16s)]
*  It was his lawyers. [[01:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5281.0s)]
*  Oh, it'd be cool if he signed it. [[01:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5282.32s)]
*  And so yeah, he sent the threat. [[01:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5283.16s)]
*  And the way that it works in Tennessee, [[01:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5284.759999999999s)]
*  first and foremost, we have the good old boys here. [[01:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5286.719999999999s)]
*  So I said to him, like, this is not the state to come [[01:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5288.28s)]
*  and try your little hoopsie floopty, French, Parisian, [[01:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5290.16s)]
*  whatever it is. [[01:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5293.28s)]
*  Like, if you're messing around with kids, [[01:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5294.12s)]
*  this is not the place, this is not the place for you. [[01:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5296.36s)]
*  Secondly, like if- [[01:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5297.96s)]
*  Who was messing around with kids, the wife then? [[01:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5299.4s)]
*  Well, yeah, that's what we're calling him. [[01:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5301.36s)]
*  So Brigitte, you're saying, is a male. [[01:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5303.48s)]
*  Biological, but leaves- [[01:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5306.36s)]
*  Was a male or is a male? [[01:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5307.88s)]
*  Well, you can't really change those things in my world, [[01:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5309.4400000000005s)]
*  but lives as a woman, clearly. [[01:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5311.8s)]
*  Okay, lives as a woman now. [[01:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5314.0s)]
*  Yeah, I would have never thought that she was a man. [[01:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5315.0s)]
*  And so anyways, the story really is just like, [[01:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5317.4800000000005s)]
*  lived as a dude, transitioned, [[01:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5320.72s)]
*  met Emmanuel when he was just 14 years old. [[01:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5322.64s)]
*  Okay, so she was a woman when they met, you're saying? [[01:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5324.52s)]
*  Living as a woman early days, like not doesn't look, [[01:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5328.6s)]
*  hadn't had all the feminization surgery. [[01:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5332.6s)]
*  I can even tell you her doctor's name. [[01:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5334.72s)]
*  Oh, you're saying, so she was just kind of fresh out the- [[01:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5336.28s)]
*  Growing the hair out, like yeah, [[01:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5339.16s)]
*  starting to like live as a woman, yeah. [[01:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5340.92s)]
*  Just like fresh out the Lord and Taylor kind of. [[01:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5343.5199999999995s)]
*  And that was his drama teacher, [[01:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5345.719999999999s)]
*  and he was only 14 years old. [[01:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5347.4s)]
*  Is Lord and Taylor a women's story? [[01:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5348.24s)]
*  It's both. [[01:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5350.0s)]
*  It is? [[01:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5351.0s)]
*  I think it's out of business though. [[01:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5351.84s)]
*  It was a bad reference then. [[01:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5352.66s)]
*  And then yeah, she was just drama teacher, he was 14. [[01:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5354.599999999999s)]
*  And she was how old? [[01:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5358.32s)]

*  I swear, and that's like official, [[01:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5360.88s)]
*  that's like, they don't deny that. [[01:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5362.36s)]
*  So wait, so they're 26 year age difference? [[01:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5364.8s)]

*  so I can't really, you know- [[01:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5371.04s)]
*  14 year old? [[01:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5372.88s)]
*  Well now here, my parents didn't meet until my mom was 30. [[01:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5375.24s)]
*  That's my point, it's very different. [[01:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5378.2s)]
*  Okay, so that's interesting. [[01:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5380.12s)]
*  The age difference, if you're 30, [[01:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5380.96s)]
*  if you become an adult and you wanna whatever, [[01:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5382.4400000000005s)]
*  I don't really care, like if you wanna be a 30 year old man, [[01:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5384.08s)]
*  30 year old woman marrying a seven year old man, [[01:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5386.6s)]
*  it's not my business, you're both adults. [[01:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5388.08s)]
*  And usually there's some like financial consideration, [[01:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5389.72s)]
*  whatever, but 14 year old boy doesn't matter. [[01:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5392.2s)]
*  A dowry maybe. [[01:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5394.24s)]
*  A dowry, yeah. [[01:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5395.28s)]
*  For a 14 year old boy is just weird. [[01:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5396.32s)]
*  And so the media just kinda tried to sell it. [[01:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5398.2s)]
*  And yeah, I just kind of looked at the story, [[01:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5401.599999999999s)]
*  went through it, there was so much evidence. [[01:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5403.599999999999s)]
*  And there was a reason, they started locking, [[01:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5405.48s)]
*  they're like locking up journalists, [[01:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5407.2s)]
*  like just so you know, they started arresting people. [[01:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5408.32s)]
*  You don't do that- Really? [[01:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5410.5199999999995s)]
*  You don't do that because someone's lying, [[01:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5411.36s)]
*  you know what I'm saying? [[01:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5412.599999999999s)]
*  Look that, in a separate window, [[01:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5413.44s)]
*  look that up and then bring it up. [[01:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5414.76s)]
*  I'm gonna see this, in 1993, the age of 39, [[01:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5415.599999999999s)]
*  she met, Brigitte Macron met the 15 year old Emmanuel Macron [[01:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5417.679999999999s)]
*  in La Providence High School. [[01:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5421.48s)]
*  And that's a lie. [[01:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5422.96s)]
*  He was 14 when he was in the play, [[01:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5423.8s)]
*  because they told the story about what play he was in. [[01:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5425.08s)]
*  So the journalists went back and they were like, [[01:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5426.68s)]
*  he was 14 when he was in his play. [[01:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5428.52s)]
*  So it was like just little media lies. [[01:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5430.04s)]
*  So one year, it's about 7% of his life though at that point. [[01:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5431.92s)]
*  So it's a decent amount. [[01:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5433.4400000000005s)]
*  And everything sounds romantic [[01:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5435.4400000000005s)]
*  when you're reading all this stuff too. [[01:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5436.96s)]
*  Where she was a teacher and was student [[01:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5438.56s)]
*  and classmate of her daughter, [[01:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5440.4400000000005s)]
*  Brigitte divorced Auzier in 2006 [[01:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5442.0s)]
*  and married Macron in 2007. [[01:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5444.56s)]
*  Wow, so they really fell into something. [[01:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5446.24s)]
*  In December, 2021, Natasha Rae and Amanda Roy [[01:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5450.360000000001s)]
*  broadcast unsubstantiated rumors online [[01:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5453.36s)]
*  that Brigitte had never existed [[01:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5455.4s)]
*  and that her brother Jean-Michel Chrogno [[01:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5457.08s)]
*  had changed gender and started using that name. [[01:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5459.679999999999s)]
*  So what does this mean? [[01:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5461.84s)]
*  So what they had done was what they started to do, [[01:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5463.0s)]
*  and I show this in my series, [[01:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5465.759999999999s)]
*  is to make the mainstream media convince you [[01:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5466.92s)]
*  that it was all a lie. [[01:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5468.84s)]
*  They were suing people for defamation and winning. [[01:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5470.16s)]
*  And so they were like, obviously it's not true, [[01:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5473.679999999999s)]
*  but they were lying about why they were winning [[01:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5474.88s)]
*  the defamation claim. [[01:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5476.679999999999s)]
*  So they were never winning on the substance, [[01:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5477.599999999999s)]
*  like you transitioned. [[01:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5479.2s)]
*  They'd wait for someone to make a mistake of like, [[01:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5480.48s)]
*  not Brigitte Macron as a man, [[01:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5483.6s)]
*  but they said that Brigitte Macron [[01:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5484.8s)]
*  went to La Providence High School, [[01:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5486.4s)]
*  or like Brigitte Macron's uncle was this. [[01:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5488.88s)]
*  And then they would go and slap them [[01:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5491.44s)]
*  with a defamation lawsuit [[01:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5492.8s)]
*  and be able to prove that they made a mistake somewhere else. [[01:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5494.16s)]
*  And the press would just lie and pretend that like, [[01:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5496.56s)]
*  well, they would tell you half a truth. [[01:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5499.32s)]
*  Like they did get sued for defamation, [[01:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5501.04s)]
*  but it wasn't regarding whether or not she was a man. [[01:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5503.32s)]
*  But isn't it just love that they love? [[01:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5505.4800000000005s)]
*  I mean, so the part you're saying that's so obtuse [[01:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5507.4s)]
*  is the fact that you felt like they were groomed kind of. [[01:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5509.96s)]
*  Because if somebody who is a man or woman [[01:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5513.28s)]
*  falls in love with somebody else, that's okay. [[01:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5515.2s)]
*  That's fine, but this wasn't that. [[01:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5518.04s)]
*  And it's also because you can't then misrepresent yourself [[01:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5519.88s)]
*  as like a Catholic, a strong Catholic [[01:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5522.84s)]
*  who's leading a country, people vote for reasons. [[01:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5525.32s)]
*  So if you wanna be an open, transgendered person [[01:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5527.24s)]
*  who likes 14 year old boys, [[01:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5529.84s)]
*  and you decide to run and a country elects you, cool. [[01:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5532.0s)]
*  You know, that's their business. [[01:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5535.4400000000005s)]
*  Now, what age did they get married at? [[01:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5536.72s)]
*  They didn't get married when he was a child. [[01:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5538.24s)]
*  No, they got married in 2007, which is why. [[01:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5539.32s)]
*  When he was how old? [[01:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5541.28s)]
*  Way older. [[01:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5542.92s)]
*  Well then that's kind of diff. [[01:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5544.44s)]
*  No, but they were together. [[01:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5545.28s)]
*  They were not like. [[01:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5546.24s)]
*  Oh, they were together the whole time. [[01:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5547.08s)]
*  Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. [[01:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5547.92s)]
*  They are basically like she fell in love [[01:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5548.759999999999s)]
*  and couldn't resist anymore, and then he went to a school, [[01:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5550.2s)]
*  and they tried to romanticize it. [[01:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5552.16s)]
*  But there's a lot more that went on here. [[01:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5553.679999999999s)]
*  Like I mean, there's a ton of people around them [[01:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5555.08s)]
*  that have then been arrested for pedophile crimes. [[01:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5556.5199999999995s)]
*  No, it's like these are, I mean, I only presented the facts [[01:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5559.88s)]
*  because he sent me a legal threat. [[01:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5562.44s)]
*  Like don't publish this series sort of a thing. [[01:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5564.2s)]
*  And we went back at him and we said, [[01:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5566.36s)]
*  Mr. McCrone, we won't publish a single episode [[01:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5569.16s)]
*  if you just answer this question. [[01:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5571.6s)]
*  You know, and we gave him 21 yes or no questions. [[01:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5573.8s)]
*  The first one was Brigitte McCrone, born a biological male. [[01:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5576.6s)]
*  They came back and refused to answer. [[01:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5582.28s)]
*  They said they don't owe you an answer. [[01:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5583.76s)]
*  Now that's stupid. [[01:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5585.2s)]
*  If you're gonna tell me if this is causing you [[01:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5586.04s)]
*  so much distress and defamation, of course the laws are [[01:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5587.400000000001s)]
*  if somebody tries to get the true answer from you, [[01:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5590.92s)]
*  you can't sue for defamation. [[01:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5593.400000000001s)]
*  That's how it works in America. [[01:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5594.52s)]
*  And so. [[01:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5595.88s)]
*  But I could see somebody being like, [[01:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5596.72s)]
*  oh, this is so problematic. [[01:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5598.2s)]
*  But if I engage with it, it becomes even more problematic. [[01:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5599.16s)]
*  But if you're sending a hundred page letter, honey, [[01:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5601.2s)]
*  you're already engaging. [[01:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5602.76s)]
*  So they sent me a letter first. [[01:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5604.32s)]
*  So it's ridiculous. [[01:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5605.639999999999s)]
*  And then they said like, you know, emotional distress, [[01:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5606.5199999999995s)]
*  all this stuff. [[01:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5608.76s)]
*  Well, we said, okay, let's end this. [[01:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5609.599999999999s)]
*  We're not interested in conspiracy theories. [[01:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5610.639999999999s)]
*  We'll end this. [[01:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5612.88s)]
*  You tell us, did Brigitte McCrone live [[01:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5613.72s)]
*  as a man named Jean-Michel Trogneau? [[01:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5615.32s)]
*  Yes or no. [[01:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5616.96s)]
*  They refused to answer. [[01:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5618.12s)]
*  You know, I'm like, okay, so what is it? [[01:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5619.24s)]
*  You can't have both ways. [[01:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5621.24s)]
*  If you want this to come to an end, [[01:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5622.4s)]
*  I have the platform to end that. [[01:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5623.76s)]
*  I will say we looked into the story, [[01:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5625.0s)]
*  here are the responses we got. [[01:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5626.96s)]
*  It's definitively not true. [[01:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5628.92s)]
*  Of course I would have done that. [[01:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5629.76s)]
*  It doesn't like help my platform to be caught in a lie. [[01:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5630.88s)]
*  Then people will lose trust in me. [[01:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5634.24s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[01:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5635.6s)]
*  So if they find out that I knowingly lied [[01:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5636.44s)]
*  and she wrote and said, you know, [[01:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5638.88s)]
*  no, I never lived as this person, whatever, [[01:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5640.36s)]
*  that would reflect poorly on me. [[01:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5642.28s)]
*  Right. [[01:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5643.92s)]
*  You know? [[01:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5644.76s)]
*  Yeah, I can't tell if I think of like, [[01:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5645.6s)]
*  if that happened, would you engage or would you not engage? [[01:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5647.16s)]
*  What would you do there? [[01:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5649.44s)]
*  Because it has to be, [[01:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5650.8s)]
*  I mean, it's such a murder mystery kind of thing, [[01:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5652.72s)]
*  you know, like a- [[01:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5655.28s)]
*  The series is fun. [[01:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5656.12s)]
*  God, it's very, and since it's French, [[01:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5657.12s)]
*  they have all the stuff you can't pronounce that good. [[01:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5659.8s)]
*  I can't pronounce any of it. [[01:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5662.599999999999s)]
*  Oh, I love that shit, dude. [[01:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5663.72s)]
*  And now I'm doing the Harvey series, [[01:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5665.96s)]
*  which is gonna, people are gonna go crazy. [[01:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5667.599999999999s)]
*  But now you had a series that also was about, [[01:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5669.72s)]
*  it was about Kamala Harris's- [[01:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5674.64s)]
*  Genealogy. [[01:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5678.5599999999995s)]
*  Genealogy. [[01:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5679.4s)]
*  How did that end? [[01:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5680.28s)]
*  Because the theory was what? [[01:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5681.24s)]
*  Oh, she's just not black. [[01:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5684.04s)]
*  The whole series started by accident. [[01:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5685.16s)]
*  And I say she, I'm at the Main Street Media, [[01:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5687.8s)]
*  just came for Janet Jackson. [[01:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5689.32s)]
*  And you can't come for the Jackson family. [[01:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5690.76s)]
*  You know, I grew up in a black household. [[01:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5692.4400000000005s)]
*  You gotta be real careful. [[01:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5694.0s)]
*  You kinda look like a Jackson a little. [[01:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5694.84s)]
*  Thank you. [[01:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5695.68s)]
*  Oh my gosh, thank you. [[01:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5696.52s)]
*  Stop. [[01:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5698.12s)]
*  Shake it, shake it, babe. [[01:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5698.96s)]
*  God, it would be good. [[01:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5700.4800000000005s)]
*  Wow, I'm just gonna eat up. [[01:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5701.84s)]
*  I'm just gonna, that compliment, [[01:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5702.96s)]
*  I'm just gonna let that hit. [[01:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5704.76s)]
*  Yeah, that'd be awesome. [[01:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5705.8s)]
*  Candace Owens investigates Kamala Harris's claims [[01:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5708.0s)]
*  about her black heritage, [[01:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5710.28s)]
*  particularly focusing on a photograph Harris shared [[01:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5711.12s)]
*  in her book where she posed with a woman Harris said [[01:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5712.96s)]
*  was her grandmother. [[01:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5714.96s)]
*  It was not her grandmother. [[01:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5715.84s)]
*  It was not, and you found that out for true? [[01:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5717.28s)]
*  Yeah, we ended up finding, I just knew. [[01:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5718.76s)]
*  And it was just like a vibe. [[01:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5720.88s)]
*  Like I said, some of these things you just know. [[01:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5722.320000000001s)]
*  Like you just, you can't explain it. [[01:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5724.28s)]
*  Like when you're black, you just know certain things. [[01:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5725.68s)]
*  You know, like a fisherman sees another fisherman [[01:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5729.04s)]
*  in the wild sort of a thing. [[01:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5731.4400000000005s)]
*  Oh yeah, black people can tell if you're not black. [[01:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5732.52s)]
*  Yeah, we just kinda know. [[01:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5734.400000000001s)]
*  Except for Mac McClung who won three slam dunk titles [[01:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5735.24s)]
*  in a row, dude. [[01:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5739.08s)]
*  Who did? [[01:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5739.92s)]
*  So Mac McClung. [[01:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5740.76s)]
*  And he's just the, he's the slam dunk champion. [[01:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5742.320000000001s)]
*  He's won the three dunk competitions in a row in the NBA. [[01:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5745.28s)]
*  And you can't tell what? [[01:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5748.96s)]
*  I'm just saying, usually you can tell [[01:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5750.32s)]
*  if a guy's culturally appropriating or not. [[01:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5751.88s)]
*  But this dude is just, he just has it. [[01:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5755.44s)]
*  Is he black? [[01:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5758.08s)]
*  Nope. [[01:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5758.92s)]
*  Oh, I thought you were saying he's actually black. [[01:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5759.759999999999s)]
*  I was like, he's not black. [[01:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5761.36s)]
*  But he could be drinking black blood or something. [[01:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5762.2s)]
*  I have no idea. [[01:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5763.32s)]
*  He's obviously drinking black blood. [[01:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5764.16s)]
*  I think we can go ahead and say that. [[01:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5766.08s)]
*  He's got more bunnies in the zoo, dude. [[01:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5768.36s)]
*  That guy is just crazy. [[01:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5770.2s)]
*  Okay, but go back. [[01:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5771.48s)]
*  So. Yeah, so the Kamala Chronicles just happened [[01:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5772.32s)]
*  by accident because I was like, [[01:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5774.28s)]
*  there's nothing about her that just signals to me [[01:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5775.12s)]
*  that she's black. [[01:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5776.88s)]
*  And she was kind of running on being black. [[01:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5777.719999999999s)]
*  And then we started our series and she dropped it. [[01:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5779.24s)]
*  She would not say she was black again. [[01:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5781.24s)]
*  She would not answer. Really? [[01:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5783.2s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[01:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5784.12s)]
*  She never said it again. [[01:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5784.96s)]
*  Never called herself the first black nothing. [[01:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5785.8s)]
*  They stopped it immediately because they, [[01:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5787.96s)]
*  I just realized they like come up with these books [[01:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5789.679999999999s)]
*  and people just don't ever actually prod the narrative. [[01:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5791.759999999999s)]
*  And there was a ton of things that weren't making sense. [[01:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5794.639999999999s)]
*  And so we got in touch with her uncle and he was like, [[01:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5796.48s)]
*  nope, that person's not related to me. [[01:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5800.0s)]
*  Nope. He was like, I, it was crazy. [[01:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5803.36s)]
*  I just got, that's me. [[01:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5806.2s)]
*  I get like, I'll get into the weeds. [[01:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5807.719999999999s)]
*  So what were the final, [[01:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5809.44s)]
*  what was the final founding on that? [[01:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5810.28s)]
*  Did you come to a conclusion? [[01:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5811.92s)]
*  Yeah, she's, I mean, she's mixed her, but she's not black. [[01:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5813.5199999999995s)]
*  And so running as a first black person [[01:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5817.44s)]
*  was just completely crazy. [[01:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5819.12s)]
*  She's not mixed black. [[01:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5820.16s)]
*  Like she's. [[01:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5821.08s)]
*  She's no black at all you're saying. [[01:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5821.92s)]
*  She's Indian, Syrian Jew and Irish. [[01:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5823.0s)]
*  So she's un-black then. [[01:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5828.24s)]
*  She's un-black. [[01:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5829.32s)]
*  Wow. [[01:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5830.2s)]
*  Yeah, and she was running on like a black thing. [[01:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5831.04s)]
*  That's what you're saying, huh? [[01:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5832.56s)]
*  And it's tough because you don't, you can't see if somebody, [[01:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5834.120000000001s)]
*  I mean, I guess they should have like a black database [[01:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5836.68s)]
*  or something, but I don't even, how much would that cost us? [[01:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5838.96s)]
*  We just know. [[01:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5841.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5841.84s)]
*  We just know. [[01:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5842.68s)]
*  And maybe as a black person, you do just know. [[01:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5843.52s)]
*  And these are series, right? [[01:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5845.4400000000005s)]
*  You have one about. [[01:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5846.56s)]
*  Kamala, one about Brigitte. [[01:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5847.8s)]
*  And now the one that we're doing [[01:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5849.76s)]
*  is the Harvey Weinstein files. [[01:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5850.84s)]
*  Harvey Weinstein files. [[01:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5852.84s)]
*  And did he, somebody said that he emailed you [[01:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5853.68s)]
*  from prison or something? [[01:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5855.52s)]
*  No, it actually started, there was a random woman [[01:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5856.6s)]
*  who had reached out to me and basically said, [[01:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5859.080000000001s)]
*  you're the only person that I think [[01:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5862.4s)]
*  that would actually look into this case beyond the media. [[01:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5863.5599999999995s)]
*  And I'll be honest, when they first contacted me, [[01:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5866.28s)]
*  I was like convinced he was guilty. [[01:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5868.44s)]
*  Because there was just so many people [[01:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5870.4s)]
*  that were saying that he did this or that. [[01:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5872.44s)]
*  And I'm like, someone somewhere has to be telling the truth. [[01:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5873.92s)]
*  And then when I got into the actual, [[01:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5876.28s)]
*  after speaking to him, which was like a crazy conversation. [[01:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5878.12s)]
*  You spoke to Harvey? [[01:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5881.0s)]
*  Yeah, I've been speaking to Harvey for years now. [[01:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5882.04s)]
*  And it was a crazy conversation because there was no reason, [[01:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5884.16s)]
*  we have nothing in common. [[01:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5887.0s)]
*  Harvey, first and foremost, [[01:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5888.8s)]
*  was like the number one donor to the ADL. [[01:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5889.8s)]
*  I'm like on their list. [[01:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5892.400000000001s)]
*  Like he's huge Democratic donor, I'm Republican. [[01:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5893.24s)]
*  And he's still all of those things, [[01:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5898.24s)]
*  which is like when we had our first conversation, [[01:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5899.84s)]
*  he was just sort of like, who are you? [[01:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5902.4400000000005s)]
*  Like, why do you exist? [[01:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5904.4800000000005s)]
*  Like why is someone- [[01:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5905.360000000001s)]
*  Did you reach out to him? [[01:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5906.2s)]
*  No, that person put us on the phone. [[01:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5907.320000000001s)]
*  I guess she was kind of lobbying him being like, [[01:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5908.84s)]
*  you need to have someone who's an independent journalist [[01:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5912.4800000000005s)]
*  look at this case, [[01:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5914.84s)]
*  or it's never gonna get a fair shake in the media [[01:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5915.68s)]
*  because they have you as like the devil. [[01:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5917.8s)]
*  So that was like a super interesting conversation [[01:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5920.16s)]
*  and we still have nothing in common, [[01:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5921.92s)]
*  but I am very good at being nuanced. [[01:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5924.68s)]
*  And a lot of people, if you don't like Trump, [[01:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5927.16s)]
*  then you are okay if he's wrongfully convicted. [[01:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5929.8s)]
*  They pick people's character and decide that they're okay [[01:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5932.4s)]
*  with whatever happens to them. [[01:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5934.76s)]
*  And I'm kind of the opposite, [[01:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5935.76s)]
*  where I will be very nuanced and say, [[01:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5937.08s)]
*  like Harvey was immoral, Harvey was cheating on his wife, [[01:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5939.16s)]
*  Harvey was abusing his power as the guy in Hollywood. [[01:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5942.32s)]
*  I do not believe after looking at the case [[01:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5948.0s)]
*  that he has been, [[01:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5950.52s)]
*  I do believe that he's been wrongfully convicted. [[01:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5951.72s)]
*  And so it actually, as I was looking into this, [[01:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5953.32s)]
*  his case in New York got overturned on appeal. [[01:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5955.76s)]
*  And so it's gonna be interesting to see what happens, [[01:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5958.8s)]
*  but he definitely, [[01:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5961.6s)]
*  he knows where all the bodies are buried in Hollywood too. [[01:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5964.2s)]
*  So he was an interesting guy to piss off [[01:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5966.16s)]
*  because he was the phone call. [[01:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5967.76s)]
*  He was the one phone call every A-lister made [[01:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5970.08s)]
*  when they got themselves into trouble too. [[01:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5972.32s)]
*  And they all turned on him because- [[01:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5973.96s)]
*  He was kind of like the closer over there, [[01:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5975.52s)]
*  the seriano or whatever. [[01:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5976.96s)]
*  And when the Me Too movement happened, [[01:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5978.96s)]
*  I think men were scared. [[01:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5980.4s)]
*  So a lot of them turned on him [[01:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5981.36s)]
*  because what other option did you have? [[01:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5982.6s)]
*  They had woman after woman after woman coming out [[01:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5984.68s)]
*  and men could not stand up in that environment [[01:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5987.36s)]
*  when it first happened. [[01:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5990.32s)]
*  And so I think a lot of them turned on him [[01:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5992.0s)]
*  because they just were, it was basic self-preservation. [[01:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5993.72s)]
*  Oh, I checked my penis in the hospice, I remember. [[01:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5996.36s)]
*  It was just a tough time for guys. [[01:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=5999.36s)]
*  Yeah, you were afraid to shake dude's hands. [[01:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6001.96s)]
*  I remember that. [[01:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6003.64s)]
*  You were afraid to even be, like, it was scary. [[01:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6004.8s)]
*  And you would try to speak up for friends [[01:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6007.84s)]
*  that you didn't think did something or that you did. [[01:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6009.24s)]
*  And then you would just be bastardized online. [[01:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6011.4400000000005s)]
*  I remember there was famous celebrities [[01:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6014.76s)]
*  who would tag me and other friends in tweets [[01:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6018.6s)]
*  and be like, they knew everything, just shit. [[01:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6021.04s)]
*  What are you fucking talking? [[01:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6022.92s)]
*  We do not know, you know? [[01:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6026.12s)]
*  Just put crazy shit. [[01:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6027.92s)]
*  And careers were being ended on a blink of a tweet. [[01:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6029.24s)]
*  She'd be like, he looked at me funny [[01:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6033.08s)]
*  and they would be like, he stepped down [[01:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6034.68s)]
*  from the corporation today. [[01:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6037.64s)]
*  I'm like, over the tweet, what's happening here? [[01:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6038.8s)]
*  It was wild times. [[01:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6041.320000000001s)]
*  I always stood up against the Me Too movement. [[01:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6042.72s)]
*  I was very adamantly against it, vocal against it. [[01:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6044.200000000001s)]
*  And people on the left and the right [[01:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6046.6s)]
*  condemned me for it, for my stance on Me Too. [[01:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6048.08s)]
*  I think the Me Too, I think it was definitely got, [[01:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6050.68s)]
*  everything goes overboard, right? [[01:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6053.400000000001s)]
*  Out of control. [[01:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6055.04s)]
*  I mean, we need due process. [[01:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6055.96s)]
*  You can't just tweet something and say, Theobon did this [[01:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6057.8s)]
*  and then he loses everything. [[01:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6060.92s)]
*  You gotta actually have due process. [[01:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6061.84s)]
*  You'd see male animals hitchhiking down 65, [[01:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6063.8s)]
*  be like, I gotta get out of this town. [[01:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6066.400000000001s)]
*  What do you fucking do? [[01:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6068.04s)]
*  It's just fucking, it's getting hot in the kennel, brother. [[01:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6069.52s)]
*  It was crazy. [[01:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6072.320000000001s)]
*  But yeah, so I think me doing this is because now [[01:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6073.16s)]
*  that everyone's done snorting the Me Too lines [[01:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6076.0s)]
*  and it's coming down from the high, [[01:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6079.76s)]
*  it's good to be like, hey, so you remember when we were [[01:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6081.84s)]
*  doing that thing and everyone was just kind of saying [[01:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6083.88s)]
*  everyone was guilty on the basis of an allegation, [[01:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6085.8s)]
*  let's actually go back and look at one of these cases. [[01:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6087.4400000000005s)]
*  And you look at Harvey Weinstein case. [[01:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6089.2s)]
*  I believe it is the case. [[01:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6090.76s)]
*  You believe he was innocent. [[01:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6092.6s)]
*  I believe he was wrongfully convicted. [[01:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6093.52s)]
*  I don't wanna say Harvey Weinstein is a moral [[01:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6095.040000000001s)]
*  or an innocent man, because that sounds like I'm saying [[01:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6097.280000000001s)]
*  he behaved well, but there is a difference [[01:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6099.64s)]
*  between being immoral and being a person [[01:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6101.72s)]
*  who abuses their power and being a person [[01:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6104.72s)]
*  who was running the peninsula like his own personal brothel [[01:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6106.52s)]
*  and being a cold-blooded rapist. [[01:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6109.360000000001s)]
*  And so I want to show people what, [[01:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6112.240000000001s)]
*  because I was shocked opening these documents [[01:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6113.76s)]
*  and text messages and emails and reading what these women [[01:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6116.400000000001s)]
*  were saying after their rapes and like, you know, [[01:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6119.96s)]
*  there's a certain way that I would speak to my rapist [[01:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6122.56s)]
*  and that is not at all, right? [[01:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6125.120000000001s)]
*  And so some of these- [[01:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6127.4400000000005s)]
*  And is a lot of this stuff public domain? [[01:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6128.92s)]
*  No, because the media would not report on it. [[01:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6130.76s)]
*  And it's so similar to what we saw with this like [[01:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6132.96s)]
*  whole Blake Lively thing going on, [[01:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6135.040000000001s)]
*  where once they drop the article, [[01:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6136.72s)]
*  the New York Times removes context. [[01:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6138.64s)]
*  Like it's like, okay, well, if we had had those messages [[01:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6140.84s)]
*  that she sent to Justin Baldoni, [[01:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6143.240000000001s)]
*  people would not have instantly tried to cancel [[01:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6144.6s)]
*  Justin Baldoni, because they would have said, [[01:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6146.320000000001s)]
*  oh, this needs context. [[01:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6147.6s)]
*  And now it's time, we're now in the era of context. [[01:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6149.080000000001s)]
*  So we need to go backwards and look at that most crucial [[01:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6151.16s)]
*  case, because that was the beginning of it all. [[01:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6153.36s)]
*  And he took the fall for the Me Too movement. [[01:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6155.04s)]
*  And he's still a very powerful person. [[01:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6157.24s)]
*  Like it was like, we have gotten into it. [[01:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6159.5599999999995s)]
*  Like I'm just like arguing in prison with Harvey Weinstein [[01:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6161.88s)]
*  and you can see who he is and who he was. [[01:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6165.16s)]
*  But I just believe in justice. [[01:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6168.5199999999995s)]
*  If I hate you, I will still defend you [[01:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6169.5199999999995s)]
*  if I think you're wrongfully convicted. [[01:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6171.24s)]
*  I hated Matt Lauer and I was like, come on guys, [[01:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6172.4s)]
*  calling him a rapist because he had an affair [[01:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6174.48s)]
*  with his intern. [[01:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6175.84s)]
*  I mean, women are just always so hopeless. [[01:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6176.88s)]
*  Why even hire an intern? [[01:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6179.84s)]
*  Yeah, I know. [[01:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6181.12s)]
*  But the men get powerful. [[01:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6182.2s)]
*  That's a joke, I think, yeah. [[01:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6184.6s)]
*  For men now though, I mean, like what is the incentive [[01:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6186.4400000000005s)]
*  to hire women after the Me Too era? [[01:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6188.56s)]
*  If we don't go back and course correct, I would be scared. [[01:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6190.400000000001s)]
*  I will say this, I was afraid to bring female comics [[01:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6192.88s)]
*  on the road because it was spooky. [[01:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6197.08s)]
*  And you'd be like, well, what if- [[01:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6201.04s)]
*  One wrong joke. [[01:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6202.400000000001s)]
*  Right, what if I look at them a certain way? [[01:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6203.52s)]
*  I mean, I'm in like, we just did a movie, [[01:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6205.68s)]
*  mine and I just self-funded our own film [[01:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6209.92s)]
*  and put it together and everything. [[01:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6211.96s)]
*  And so we just got done doing it and I was like, [[01:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6213.12s)]
*  oh, on set, I was like, oh, I gotta be, [[01:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6219.76s)]
*  can't joke around, gotta be careful what you're saying. [[01:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6222.72s)]
*  Or I would yell out, that's a joke, right? [[01:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6226.12s)]
*  If I said something that I thought might be obtuse. [[01:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6228.24s)]
*  I mean, that's not fun. [[01:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6231.44s)]
*  It's like we need to go back to being able [[01:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6232.76s)]
*  to make fun of women. [[01:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6234.5199999999995s)]
*  And also, by the way, the end result, [[01:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6235.44s)]
*  women don't like that. [[01:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6236.72s)]
*  They don't like men that are castrated [[01:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6237.72s)]
*  and men that now won't ask women on dates, [[01:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6239.76s)]
*  men that won't hit on women. [[01:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6241.4400000000005s)]
*  So we created a whole culture and now women [[01:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6242.8s)]
*  are frustrated by the culture. [[01:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6244.8s)]
*  Everyone's a wimp. [[01:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6245.96s)]
*  It's like, okay, cool, ask her out, [[01:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6247.0s)]
*  tell her she looks nice. [[01:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6249.360000000001s)]
*  And guess what, girls, you can just say, [[01:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6250.18s)]
*  no, I'm not into you. [[01:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6251.92s)]
*  He can suffer the humiliation of thinking he had a chance. [[01:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6253.240000000001s)]
*  But why are we ruining natural relations [[01:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6255.92s)]
*  between men and women? [[01:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6258.400000000001s)]
*  It's nice for guys to hold doors, [[01:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6259.240000000001s)]
*  ask you out, make you feel pretty. [[01:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6260.88s)]
*  Get you a chocolate or something. [[01:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6263.6s)]
*  Yeah, definitely. [[01:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6265.320000000001s)]
*  When I was young, yeah, you give a girl a chocolate or something, [[01:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6267.0s)]
*  take a girl out for a fish filet or whatever. [[01:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6269.68s)]
*  Yeah, from McDonald's? [[01:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6272.28s)]
*  Oh, no, like a real one or whatever. [[01:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6274.0s)]
*  Do my mommy sort of the fish filet, [[01:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6276.16s)]
*  she would fucking, I... [[01:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6277.72s)]
*  I need to know, what's your meal at McDonald's? [[01:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6280.64s)]
*  I judge everybody by this, so be very careful. [[01:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6282.44s)]
*  Me, I do a double hamburger, which isn't on the menu, [[01:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6284.2s)]
*  but you can get it with pickles and ketchup. [[01:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6287.72s)]
*  Do you add any Big Mac sauce to that? [[01:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6289.64s)]
*  No, I don't know who's making it back there. [[01:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6291.64s)]
*  It depends. [[01:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6293.6s)]
*  If Big Mac himself is back there, I'll take a couple ounces. [[01:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6294.8s)]
*  That's an OK order. [[01:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6297.4800000000005s)]
*  I mean, it's not fun, but it's OK. [[01:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6298.4800000000005s)]
*  Yeah, it's kind of sad, though, but I'll tell you this, [[01:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6300.08s)]
*  I used to get two milks with it. [[01:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6302.4800000000005s)]
*  Milks? [[01:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6304.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6305.400000000001s)]
*  What in the Theovon world is a thing? [[01:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6306.24s)]
*  We ride here. [[01:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6307.68s)]
*  What? [[01:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6308.84s)]
*  Oh, hell yeah, boy. [[01:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6309.8s)]
*  What? [[01:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6311.16s)]
*  Two milks? [[01:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6312.0s)]
*  See me in the streets, you don't know me. [[01:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6312.84s)]
*  I'm the TI of fucking Mickey D's orders, baby. [[01:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6315.0s)]
*  Look at that little milk jug right there. [[01:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6317.8s)]
*  And that's what he used to call my sister, the milk jug. [[01:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6320.360000000001s)]
*  He's the only person that's ever... [[01:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6322.56s)]
*  He used to call my sister the little milk jug. [[01:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6324.44s)]
*  Because she built like that. [[01:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6326.599999999999s)]
*  She built like that. [[01:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6327.84s)]
*  Click on the third one right there. [[01:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6328.76s)]
*  Nobody in the history of McDonald's ever got the milk jug. [[01:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6330.44s)]
*  But Theovon, they kept that on the menu for Theovon. [[01:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6334.679999999999s)]
*  You can't order more than two. [[01:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6337.36s)]
*  That's the crazy thing. [[01:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6338.4s)]
*  What? [[01:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6339.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6339.72s)]
*  That's a limit. [[01:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6340.72s)]
*  Because they only have like 10 because no one orders them. [[01:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6341.24s)]
*  So if you order more than two, they've been sitting at the... [[01:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6343.44s)]
*  We ride here. [[01:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6345.8s)]
*  I'm just saying we get it how we live. [[01:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6347.96s)]
*  Wait, stop, a double cheeseburger with a double milk jug? [[01:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6350.92s)]
*  Oh, double milk jug, baby. [[01:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6353.68s)]
*  Give me two of them. [[01:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6355.52s)]
*  And the lady be like, you really want two? [[01:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6356.88s)]
*  I'd be like, yeah. [[01:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6358.72s)]
*  And then we would laugh a little bit. [[01:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6360.6s)]
*  I'd tip her. [[01:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6361.88s)]
*  But yeah, that's how I like mine, like that double milk jug. [[01:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6363.12s)]
*  I used to get an apple pie, but I just, [[01:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6365.96s)]
*  I don't want all that sugar anymore. [[01:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6368.0s)]
*  But my mother, I forgot to tell you this. [[01:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6370.4400000000005s)]
*  That's a Theovon order, man. [[01:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6372.360000000001s)]
*  That is right there. [[01:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6373.72s)]
*  My mother, she would let us order. [[01:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6374.8s)]
*  And then she would be like, [[01:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6377.04s)]
*  she would order the McFish or whatever. [[01:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6379.4800000000005s)]
*  But it would almost be like she was ordering [[01:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6381.280000000001s)]
*  a special, she'd be like, they'll have this and this [[01:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6383.16s)]
*  and this and this, what do you want? [[01:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6386.28s)]
*  She'd be like, and I'll have the McFish. [[01:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6387.12s)]
*  It was almost like it was like... [[01:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6389.16s)]
*  The adult order. [[01:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6391.16s)]
*  Yeah, like quiet down, let me do business here [[01:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6392.0s)]
*  with this person. [[01:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6394.92s)]
*  I'll have the McFish. [[01:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6395.76s)]
*  Yeah, see, I feel like I can't trust the McFish. [[01:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6396.76s)]
*  That upsets me. [[01:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6399.08s)]
*  Hell no. [[01:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6399.92s)]
*  She has the wrong order. [[01:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6400.92s)]
*  And I'm not here to respect your mother, [[01:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6402.04s)]
*  but I would speak to her about that. [[01:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6404.2s)]
*  Of course, I've never looked at an ocean [[01:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6405.64s)]
*  and at a McDonald's and be like, yeah, [[01:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6408.0s)]
*  these things should know each other. [[01:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6409.48s)]
*  That is so fucking... [[01:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6411.64s)]
*  There is not a yellow brick road that connects those bitches. [[01:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6413.28s)]
*  But so it always blew... [[01:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6417.08s)]

*  But I don't even know where to find a Steak and Shake [[01:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6456.88s)]
*  because I'm from the North. [[01:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6459.04s)]
*  You'll get them. [[01:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6459.96s)]
*  Have you had Steak and Shake? [[01:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6460.88s)]
*  No, but I say go door to door if you're Steak and Shake. [[01:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6462.04s)]
*  I don't even... [[01:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6464.5599999999995s)]
*  I used to sell door to door Italian [[01:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6465.4s)]
*  with this guy for a little bit. [[01:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6466.5199999999995s)]
*  Do you think that mainstream media has an overall goal [[01:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6468.92s)]
*  or has had an overall goal besides just capitalism? [[01:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6471.400000000001s)]
*  Do you really think that? [[01:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6473.96s)]
*  I think they were just in service to the state. [[01:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6475.04s)]
*  I think the whole idea of the fourth estate was fake. [[01:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6476.56s)]
*  They weren't here to defend the people. [[01:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6479.16s)]
*  They were here to defend the state. [[01:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6480.28s)]
*  At least since the 60s. [[01:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6481.64s)]
*  That's what they've been doing. [[01:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6482.76s)]
*  And now they are... [[01:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6484.56s)]
*  Where they are right now is in survival mode. [[01:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6486.04s)]
*  They don't know what to do. [[01:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6487.92s)]
*  They don't know what to do with the new media. [[01:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6488.76s)]
*  I think they're gonna try to create back doorways [[01:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6491.2s)]
*  to reacquire their talent. [[01:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6492.8s)]
*  I don't know if you followed the recent deal [[01:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6494.36s)]
*  with Fox News building, which is crazy. [[01:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6496.28s)]
*  They purchased Red Seat Ventures. [[01:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6500.36s)]
*  Do you work with Red Seat Ventures? [[01:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6502.4s)]
*  Red Seek? [[01:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6503.5199999999995s)]
*  Red Seat. [[01:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6504.719999999999s)]
*  That's a no. [[01:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6505.5599999999995s)]
*  You don't work with them. No, I don't. [[01:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6506.4s)]
*  So they were doing advertising for independent podcasters. [[01:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6507.4s)]
*  And we had spoken to them and we were just kind of like, [[01:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6510.76s)]
*  mm, no, we kind of broke away from corporation structure. [[01:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6512.639999999999s)]
*  We don't really wanna like... [[01:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6515.24s)]
*  We wanna do everything in house sort of a thing. [[01:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6516.8s)]
*  And then they purchased Red Seat Ventures. [[01:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6518.679999999999s)]
*  So they were able to kind of back door reacquire [[01:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6521.96s)]
*  Tucker Carlson, Megyn Kelly, everyone they fired, [[01:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6525.24s)]
*  which is kind of crazy. [[01:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6527.28s)]
*  Like, think about how weird that is. [[01:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6528.12s)]
*  I was sitting here looking at this deal and I'm like, [[01:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6530.08s)]
*  didn't you just fire Tucker? [[01:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6532.04s)]
*  And now you're like, why don't you guys just admit [[01:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6533.28s)]
*  you were wrong? [[01:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6534.44s)]
*  Just come out and be like, you know what? [[01:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6535.28s)]
*  Tucker's got the juice. [[01:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6536.72s)]
*  Oh, I see. [[01:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6538.28s)]
*  Instead of just admitting it publicly one way, [[01:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6539.12s)]
*  they would rather lose it and then go back door. [[01:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6541.08s)]
*  So there's all these articles, [[01:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6543.36s)]
*  Fox News is interested in the podcast world. [[01:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6544.2s)]
*  And so they reacquired, via just the, [[01:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6546.2s)]
*  I'm not saying that they own the Tucker Carlson podcast. [[01:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6550.5599999999995s)]
*  They don't, but Tucker Carlson and Megyn Kelly [[01:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6552.44s)]
*  and who's the third one? [[01:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6555.44s)]
*  Bill O'Reilly, who they literally fired all these people, [[01:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6556.919999999999s)]
*  were all using Red Seat Ventures. [[01:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6559.96s)]
*  And Red Seat Ventures, their pitch, [[01:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6562.28s)]
*  cause I remember that I spoke to them, [[01:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6563.759999999999s)]
*  was kind of like, eventually all roads lead [[01:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6564.839999999999s)]
*  to Red Seat Ventures cause you realize you need somebody [[01:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6567.4s)]
*  to do your advertising deals. [[01:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6569.24s)]
*  Like you're going independent, [[01:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6570.679999999999s)]
*  but you don't wanna handle all the advertisers, whatever. [[01:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6571.5199999999995s)]
*  And so they literally, yeah, [[01:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6574.2s)]
*  if you look up Red Seat Ventures just in Google, [[01:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6576.639999999999s)]
*  you'll see like the recent deal. [[01:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6578.839999999999s)]
*  Fox News acquired Red Seat Ventures. [[01:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6580.96s)]
*  And I'm like, okay, that's just, it's an interesting, [[01:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6583.12s)]
*  it's objectively an interesting move [[01:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6586.16s)]
*  because it kind of signals to me [[01:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6588.4s)]
*  that you wanted to reacquire your talent. [[01:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6589.92s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[01:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6592.2s)]
*  And so- [[01:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6593.04s)]
*  Fox Corporation today announces acquisition [[01:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6593.88s)]
*  of Red Seat Ventures, a leading business [[01:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6595.2s)]
*  in the creator economy that powers talent [[01:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6596.6s)]
*  across a range of genres as they build [[01:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6598.04s)]
*  their direct to consumer media business. [[01:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6599.64s)]
*  Does it say what talent it works with though? [[01:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6603.96s)]
*  Yeah, scroll down. [[01:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6606.16s)]
*  So Chris Belf is the other, the founding partners. [[01:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6607.4400000000005s)]
*  Chris Balfe and Kevin Balfe, [[01:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6610.32s)]
*  I'm assuming brothers or husbands. [[01:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6612.16s)]
*  Yeah, I would go out of PR Newswire [[01:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6614.12s)]
*  because that's just like them writing it [[01:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6616.12s)]
*  and they're not gonna say what talent was with it. [[01:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6617.48s)]
*  I would go to Reuters, yeah. [[01:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6619.96s)]
*  They would probably have, yeah. [[01:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6622.4s)]
*  Reuters, is that how you say that? [[01:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6623.72s)]
*  You know what, I've been saying Reuters. [[01:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6625.28s)]
*  It could not be right, [[01:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6627.0s)]
*  but that will tell you that like your- [[01:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6628.12s)]
*  And it's just me at there. [[01:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6630.36s)]
*  Yeah, so they've been interested, [[01:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6631.28s)]
*  but like, yeah, it was Tucker Carlson, Megan Kelly, [[01:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6632.5199999999995s)]
*  and oh, here you go. [[01:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6634.76s)]
*  Carlson, Kelly, Sean Ryan. [[01:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6635.92s)]
*  Oh, no, that's just saying that we reached [[01:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6637.72s)]
*  millions of subscribers daily, but yeah, they had- [[01:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6639.12s)]
*  You'll bring O'Reilly, Kelly, and Carlson [[01:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6643.04s)]
*  back into Murdoch's fold. [[01:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6645.5199999999995s)]
*  So I didn't like that at all [[01:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6647.36s)]
*  for like Carlson and Kelly and O'Reilly [[01:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6649.16s)]
*  because I'm like, whoa, whoa, whoa, [[01:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6651.44s)]
*  you fired me, homie. [[01:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6652.5199999999995s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6653.76s)]
*  Like, hold on, let's be very clear. [[01:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6654.6s)]
*  You shamed me publicly, you fired me, [[01:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6655.5599999999995s)]
*  you said, whatever, I wasn't a part of this, [[01:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6658.76s)]
*  whatever it was, and now you're kind of like [[01:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6661.04s)]
*  trying to build this little backward network. [[01:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6663.12s)]
*  No, you need to say you're sorry first. [[01:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6664.88s)]
*  Wow. [[01:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6666.4s)]
*  But I'm sure that like obviously, [[01:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6667.24s)]
*  Red Sea will have had a deal with them that will expire [[01:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6668.48s)]
*  and what will happen is those people just won't renew [[01:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6670.839999999999s)]
*  if they don't want to because they might say, [[01:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6672.5599999999995s)]
*  no, you literally fired me. [[01:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6674.24s)]
*  Oh, I see. [[01:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6675.48s)]
*  Do you get what I'm saying? [[01:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6676.4s)]
*  So yeah, so they're the middle guy, [[01:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6677.24s)]
*  but I thought it was an interesting move [[01:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6678.28s)]
*  without saying you're sorry, trying to reacquire someone. [[01:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6680.12s)]
*  Well, I do think it's interesting that some political areas, [[01:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6683.599999999999s)]
*  some shows have become more, [[01:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6687.16s)]
*  have slowly tried to like slurp [[01:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6689.639999999999s)]
*  on a more of a conservative side. [[01:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6691.36s)]
*  Like Bill Maher did that well over the past four or five years [[01:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6692.919999999999s)]
*  you started to see him like, he recognized like. [[01:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6698.4400000000005s)]
*  Where the wind was blowing. [[01:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6701.6s)]
*  Just yeah, he was able to see it ahead. [[01:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6702.4400000000005s)]
*  Do you think America is a place that everybody is just here [[01:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6705.76s)]
*  and you can be here and be not even supporting America? [[01:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6710.4s)]
*  That's what's interesting to me about America. [[01:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6713.04s)]
*  That's what I start to recognize. [[01:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6714.64s)]
*  Like, oh, well some people are here, [[01:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6715.64s)]
*  but they don't, they're not America first, right? [[01:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6717.56s)]
*  Or they may not be. [[01:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6720.28s)]
*  Do you think America's always kind of been that [[01:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6722.4s)]
*  and that's what it is? [[01:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6724.76s)]
*  It's kind of this halfway house for everywhere [[01:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6725.92s)]
*  of like it's of the whole planet [[01:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6729.96s)]
*  or do you feel like it's this other, [[01:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6731.8s)]
*  like you have to buy into this, you know, [[01:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6734.36s)]
*  red, white and blue stars and stripes? [[01:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6736.76s)]
*  What I would say is right now, [[01:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6740.76s)]
*  America's kind of in the midst of this identity crisis. [[01:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6743.28s)]
*  And that's in large part because it's been conditioned now [[01:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6745.76s)]
*  by the media and the school system and partnership [[01:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6749.36s)]
*  to kind of tell people you should hate your country. [[01:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6753.28s)]
*  And the reality is most Americans never leave their country. [[01:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6756.200000000001s)]
*  They have nothing to weigh it against [[01:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6757.88s)]
*  and they sort of blindly accept this narrative [[01:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6760.200000000001s)]
*  that like we're just these bad guys who did bad things [[01:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6762.4800000000005s)]
*  and there's been sort of this like American shaming [[01:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6764.76s)]
*  that's taken place and it's been effective. [[01:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6767.120000000001s)]
*  That began to sort of snap back with Trump culture [[01:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6770.68s)]
*  and that's kind of what people were missing. [[01:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6773.280000000001s)]
*  It wasn't about when we make America great again, [[01:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6774.52s)]
*  it's like allow me to just feel good as a American. [[01:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6775.92s)]
*  Like, why can't I like being American? [[01:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6778.240000000001s)]
*  Why can't, what's wrong with just being straight? [[01:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6779.76s)]
*  Like it's like we celebrate everything, [[01:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6781.96s)]
*  but like we almost started like hating normalcy, [[01:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6784.16s)]
*  which is like a weird thing to say, [[01:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6787.5599999999995s)]
*  but like if you were gay, if you were anything, [[01:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6788.599999999999s)]
*  is something going on, whatever it is handicapped, [[01:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6792.44s)]
*  it was like, yes, yes. [[01:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6794.599999999999s)]
*  And then if you were just like, [[01:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6795.639999999999s)]
*  yeah, I'm just like a straight white dude. [[01:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6797.04s)]
*  It was like, oh my gosh, what do you mean? [[01:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6799.28s)]
*  That's not. [[01:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6802.4s)]
*  You're queer, then they would yell you. [[01:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6803.24s)]
*  Yeah, you guys became the queers, yeah. [[01:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6804.32s)]
*  And so that was weird. [[01:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6806.5599999999995s)]
*  And the American flag became this right wing symbol, [[01:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6809.5199999999995s)]
*  which I was like, what's happening? [[01:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6812.24s)]
*  But it was like, doesn't anybody see that? [[01:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6814.76s)]
*  Don't you notice like, I wish there were more parties. [[01:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6816.4800000000005s)]
*  I don't think there's enough parties that, [[01:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6820.32s)]
*  I think you can't pigeonhole people [[01:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6822.92s)]
*  into Republican or Democrat most of the time. [[01:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6824.64s)]
*  I don't think you'd ever be able to pigeonhole me that way. [[01:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6827.68s)]
*  I think there should be more political parties [[01:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6830.0s)]
*  so we feel like you can find one that fits you. [[01:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6831.64s)]
*  Because it's just this dirty Cinderella [[01:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6835.2s)]
*  where neither one of these fucking clogs [[01:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6837.08s)]
*  is really helping me get down the stairs anymore, [[01:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6839.52s)]
*  it feels like. Right. [[01:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6841.4s)]
*  But you're right, you said we were saying [[01:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6842.4s)]
*  that the flag became this symbol of like. [[01:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6844.080000000001s)]
*  And it's like, nobody else noticed that? [[01:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6845.64s)]
*  That's our country's flag, right? [[01:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6847.360000000001s)]
*  It's like, what's wrong with this? [[01:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6849.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6850.64s)]
*  That's what I mean, we got crazy. [[01:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6851.6s)]
*  We got absolutely crazy. [[01:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6853.56s)]
*  And so we were in the midst of an identity crisis, [[01:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6855.160000000001s)]
*  but it was being, it was a social engineering. [[01:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6857.68s)]
*  It happened intentionally, [[01:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6860.76s)]
*  they wanted people to feel that way. [[01:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6861.84s)]
*  And I think now it's snapping back [[01:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6863.160000000001s)]
*  and we're starting to realize the problem is, [[01:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6864.8s)]
*  it are these people who are making us feel [[01:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6866.72s)]
*  like we had nothing in common [[01:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6868.4400000000005s)]
*  and we have a lot more in common than we don't. [[01:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6869.76s)]
*  And so there's like, [[01:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6871.56s)]
*  and now we're going through like this period of healing, [[01:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6872.84s)]
*  which has been nice. [[01:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6874.32s)]
*  And we were kind of talking about this off camera [[01:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6875.16s)]
*  where it seems like the right and the left [[01:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6877.28s)]
*  are finding things to agree on [[01:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6878.88s)]
*  and realizing that these caricatures [[01:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6880.4800000000005s)]
*  of what it means to be a left, [[01:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6882.360000000001s)]
*  be on the left or the right were largely created [[01:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6883.8s)]
*  by the media. [[01:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6886.16s)]
*  Yes, you can find very fringe people on both sides [[01:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6887.0s)]
*  who do not defy or who are the stereotype, [[01:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6889.72s)]
*  but that's not the majority of people. [[01:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6894.84s)]
*  More majority of people just wanna go to work, [[01:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6896.24s)]
*  have a job, have low gas prices. [[01:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6897.4800000000005s)]
*  Live in a safe place. Live in a safe place. [[01:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6899.360000000001s)]
*  It's not that hard, right? [[01:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6900.64s)]
*  Right. [[01:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6901.48s)]
*  Right. [[01:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6902.32s)]
*  Yeah, it's called Nashville. [[01:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6903.16s)]
*  But I will say this, I think, yeah, [[01:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6904.959999999999s)]
*  if you have an idea, right, that you think, [[01:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6906.719999999999s)]
*  well, we have to get rid of this group of people [[01:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6908.959999999999s)]
*  or these people aren't, [[01:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6911.5199999999995s)]
*  that is never gonna be America, right? [[01:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6913.16s)]
*  America is always, I mean, like, [[01:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6915.16s)]
*  when it comes to like races and ethnicities, right? [[01:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6917.879999999999s)]
*  It's just, it's gonna be a melting pot, right? [[01:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6920.639999999999s)]
*  So you always have to think with the goal at the end [[01:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6923.24s)]
*  is that everybody's gonna be here. [[01:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6926.44s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, but also we should be clear, [[01:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6928.639999999999s)]
*  not everybody should be here if they don't appreciate [[01:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6931.08s)]
*  what it means to be an American. [[01:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6933.52s)]
*  I agree, but how do you- You should not be [[01:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6935.0s)]
*  allowed to be here. [[01:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6936.0s)]
*  Like, there is, like, if you have resentment for America [[01:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6936.84s)]
*  and at the same time you want to come to America, [[01:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6939.320000000001s)]
*  we have a problem. [[01:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6941.92s)]
*  But then people say you have the freedom [[01:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6942.76s)]
*  to think and feel whatever you want, right? [[01:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6945.0s)]
*  Yeah, you also have the freedom to stay in your own country. [[01:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6946.64s)]
*  Right. [[01:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6948.68s)]
*  That's cool. [[01:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6949.52s)]
*  You can hate America, but we need to have a process [[01:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6950.360000000001s)]
*  where people that resent America [[01:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6952.52s)]
*  are not coming into America. [[01:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6954.4400000000005s)]
*  We do have a value system. [[01:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6955.64s)]
*  Like, America was founded on Christian principles [[01:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6957.0s)]
*  and things of that nature. [[01:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6959.96s)]
*  And they are like, no, there's nothing. [[01:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6961.28s)]
*  You can be whatever. [[01:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6962.64s)]
*  It's like, no, you can't be whatever, actually. [[01:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6963.4800000000005s)]
*  You can't just be whatever and come to America. [[01:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6965.6s)]
*  Maybe you and I have that privilege. [[01:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6969.0s)]
*  We were born here that if we get angry at our country, [[01:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6970.28s)]
*  we can voice that, but it's so much- [[01:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6972.04s)]
*  But you could be Muslim or Taiwanese. [[01:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6972.88s)]
*  You could be- Right. [[01:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6976.04s)]
*  But if you're coming here and we're able to decide [[01:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6977.0s)]
*  whether or not we want you to be here, [[01:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6978.92s)]
*  these things now, we need to make sure that culturally, [[01:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6980.88s)]
*  whatever it is that you believe [[01:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6983.4400000000005s)]
*  and whatever your ideas are, however you view America, [[01:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6985.08s)]
*  that now becomes relevant. [[01:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6987.84s)]
*  We need to have a system that works. [[01:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6988.88s)]
*  Yeah, I do think it would be nice. [[01:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6990.72s)]
*  But then it's like, how do you get into that [[01:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6992.28s)]
*  without communism, though? [[01:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6993.76s)]
*  Look at Japan. [[01:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6995.64s)]
*  Look at Japan. [[01:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6997.400000000001s)]
*  Japan is, let's be very clear, [[01:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=6998.400000000001s)]
*  we are the only country that has this idea [[01:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=7000.64s)]
*  that everyone should come here. [[01:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=7002.400000000001s)]
*  It's insane, obviously, because that doesn't work. [[01:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=7003.24s)]
*  Oh, I agree, I agree. [[01:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=7005.08s)]
*  It's like, America gets held in the media like, [[01:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=7006.12s)]
*  be welcoming and do this and do that. [[01:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=7009.36s)]
*  But then meanwhile, other countries get to be, [[01:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=7011.24s)]
*  follow their letter to the law. [[01:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=7014.88s)]
*  And we're held by our own media a lot of times, [[01:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=7016.72s)]
*  to this ridiculous fucking, [[01:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=7019.84s)]
*  why don't we have a letter to our law? [[01:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=7020.68s)]
*  We should all at least have the common ground [[01:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=7023.2s)]
*  that America is first, whether we like some things about it [[01:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=7025.28s)]
*  or don't like some things about it. [[01:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=7029.4800000000005s)]
*  Because if not, it feels like you're just one of the ops. [[01:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=7031.16s)]
*  And multiculturalism doesn't actually work. [[01:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=7033.8s)]
*  And I hate to tell people that. [[01:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=7036.2s)]
*  I know it's like a fluffy dream. [[01:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=7037.12s)]
*  It doesn't work. [[01:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=7038.52s)]
*  What do you mean by that? [[01:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=7039.360000000001s)]
*  You have to have a culture. [[01:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=7040.32s)]
*  There are certain cultures [[01:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=7041.92s)]
*  that cannot coincide with one another. [[01:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=7043.68s)]
*  So like, let's say for example, [[01:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=7046.08s)]
*  your culture believes that children should be able [[01:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=7048.0s)]
*  to make decisions about their sexuality, right? [[01:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=7053.84s)]
*  That actually conflicts with my culture. [[01:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=7057.2s)]
*  And so I actually do not want you in my country, I don't. [[01:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=7059.24s)]
*  Well, you may not want that person making the law, [[01:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=7063.4s)]
*  but they're welcome to be in their house [[01:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=7065.44s)]
*  and think and feel however they want. [[01:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=7067.5199999999995s)]
*  Well, no, I'm talking about like people that believe [[01:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=7069.4s)]
*  that like a nine-year-old girl can have sex with, [[01:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=7071.92s)]
*  that just conflicts with our culture. [[01:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=7076.8s)]
*  Right, I agree. [[01:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=7077.96s)]
*  So we don't believe in that. [[01:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=7078.8s)]
*  And so this whole idea of multiculturalism [[01:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=7080.56s)]
*  is no matter what you think, we can find a home [[01:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=7082.72s)]
*  and you can kind of build your own nest here. [[01:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=7084.4400000000005s)]
*  It's like, no, actually I'm comfortable with us saying [[01:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=7085.76s)]
*  you can't do that. [[01:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=7088.84s)]
*  I'm comfortable if we're gonna send you the front lines [[01:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=7090.0s)]
*  because of your opinions, you know what I mean? [[01:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=7091.8s)]
*  And you gotta go fight some more. [[01:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=7093.72s)]
*  And yeah, with no helmets. [[01:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=7095.6s)]
*  And so that's what it is. [[01:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=7097.56s)]
*  We have to define what it is that we believe. [[01:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=7099.04s)]
*  And it's been increasingly difficult [[01:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=7101.64s)]
*  because people are forgetting, [[01:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=7103.8s)]
*  a couple of generations ago, [[01:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=7106.160000000001s)]
*  what we agreed on in America, our parents were religious. [[01:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=7107.0s)]
*  You forget that. [[01:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=7110.080000000001s)]
*  Like what is the story of the South? [[01:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=7110.92s)]
*  Like what is the story of the Bible Belt? [[01:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=7112.120000000001s)]
*  Why is it called the Bible Belt? [[01:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=7113.56s)]
*  I mean, then that goes to a question. [[01:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=7115.400000000001s)]
*  Do you think America is a Christian nation? [[01:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=7116.64s)]
*  Yes. [[01:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=7119.72s)]
*  Or do you think it's more of a moral nation? [[01:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=7120.56s)]
*  And do you think that that's eroding? [[01:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=7124.0s)]
*  I mean, I think some of that could be [[01:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=7125.68s)]
*  a whole nother conversation probably. [[01:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=7126.76s)]
*  Yeah, it could be another conversation, [[01:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=7128.4800000000005s)]
*  but I think America was, is a Christian nation [[01:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=7129.76s)]
*  that has forgotten that in many ways. [[01:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=7133.200000000001s)]
*  And forgotten why we were so much more cohesive [[01:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=7136.24s)]
*  and comprehensive when we had faith [[01:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=7139.5199999999995s)]
*  at the center of what we did. [[01:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=7141.5599999999995s)]
*  And once we started removing faith, [[01:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=7143.08s)]
*  and I'm talking about removing the Bible from the classroom, [[01:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=7144.839999999999s)]
*  which was done in the early 70s, if I'm correct, [[01:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=7146.879999999999s)]
*  Department of Education, kind of a thing, [[01:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=7151.92s)]
*  people got lost real quick. [[01:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=7153.24s)]
*  And so I guess what I'm arguing for is a theocracy, [[01:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=7154.5199999999995s)]
*  which means you're gonna run it. [[01:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=7159.5199999999995s)]
*  A theocracy because I'm Theo? [[01:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=7161.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=7162.08s)]
*  Damn dude. [[01:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=7162.92s)]
*  I'm gonna miss this taxi I ordered in a little bit. [[01:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=7164.52s)]
*  I don't know if I can handle all that, dude. [[01:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=7166.52s)]
*  We need a theocracy. [[01:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=7168.72s)]
*  Yeah, I do think that there was something nice [[01:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=7171.72s)]
*  about having structure in the schools, [[01:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=7175.68s)]
*  but then a lot of that got challenged. [[01:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=7177.4800000000005s)]
*  Yeah, I think it is. [[01:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=7178.92s)]
*  I think America does need to figure out, [[01:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=7180.12s)]
*  well, what is our footprint? [[01:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=7181.56s)]
*  What do we want to stand up for and believe in [[01:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=7184.56s)]
*  and believe these are the things that define our country? [[01:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=7187.360000000001s)]
*  I believe that we're a Christian nation. [[01:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=7190.6s)]
*  And that used to be a thing. [[01:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=7191.84s)]
*  Before the flag became racist, [[01:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=7194.280000000001s)]
*  we were all saying one nation under God. [[01:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=7195.6s)]
*  And then we became this nation that was one nation [[01:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=7197.4800000000005s)]
*  like over God, like people are become their own gods [[02:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=7200.52s)]
*  are worshiping Hollywood. [[02:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=7203.120000000001s)]
*  It's like crazy. [[02:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=7204.120000000001s)]
*  We become like a pagan culture. [[02:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=7204.96s)]
*  Well, Hollywood is, it's celebrity. [[02:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=7206.68s)]
*  It has those things that are addictive. [[02:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=7208.320000000001s)]
*  And I think a lot of that is. [[02:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=7210.280000000001s)]
*  It's demonic. [[02:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=7211.6s)]
*  And the Bible will tell you all of those things [[02:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=7212.6s)]
*  about idolatry, kids would have been learning that. [[02:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=7214.200000000001s)]
*  I grew up learning the Bible. [[02:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=7216.200000000001s)]
*  What if it's demonic? [[02:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=7217.76s)]
*  Well, what is a demon? [[02:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=7218.76s)]
*  Right? [[02:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=7220.5199999999995s)]
*  If you have, you speak often about like, [[02:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=7221.36s)]
*  you used to have addictions and things like that. [[02:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=7222.84s)]
*  And when I grew up in a household, [[02:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=7224.88s)]
*  people, people in my family still have addiction issues. [[02:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=7227.639999999999s)]
*  It's a demon. [[02:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=7231.08s)]
*  Well, Hollywood gets, it gets pinpointed a lot [[02:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=7232.72s)]
*  because it's the glossy thing too. [[02:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=7234.92s)]
*  It's Babylon. [[02:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=7236.5599999999995s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=7237.4s)]
*  It's the, yeah, so I think. [[02:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=7238.24s)]
*  They love the culture of excess. [[02:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=7239.08s)]
*  Everything that the Bible tells us not to celebrate [[02:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=7241.16s)]
*  is like becomes like the thing. [[02:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=7243.599999999999s)]
*  That's why it's a Hollywood Babylon. [[02:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=7245.24s)]
*  It's like they're trying to stay young forever. [[02:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=7247.12s)]
*  That's weird. [[02:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=7249.4s)]
*  Like, why don't you want to age? [[02:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=7250.599999999999s)]
*  You know, like they're, look at, and they look crazy. [[02:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=7252.2s)]
*  Everybody wants to be fresh, I think. [[02:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=7255.2s)]
*  You want to be fresh, but like, I'm not afraid of aging. [[02:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=7256.839999999999s)]
*  Like I'm not like, I think it's, look at these ones. [[02:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=7259.16s)]
*  They look terrifying and they're holding and stretched. [[02:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=7260.96s)]
*  And it's like, dude, you could just be 80. [[02:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=7263.08s)]
*  Like, you know what I'm saying? [[02:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=7264.799999999999s)]
*  Yeah, somebody look like a damn dough [[02:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=7266.28s)]
*  or something that's been, yeah. [[02:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=7267.599999999999s)]
*  You look like somebody put a couple eyes in a. [[02:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=7268.96s)]
*  Like carrying after yourself. [[02:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=7271.32s)]
*  In a pizza dough or whatever. [[02:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=7272.599999999999s)]
*  Yeah, it doesn't. [[02:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=7274.0s)]
*  Somebody glued a damn snout on a pizza dough. [[02:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=7274.839999999999s)]
*  These girls are 22 looking like they're 50. [[02:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=7276.839999999999s)]
*  Dude, I'll say this. [[02:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=7280.04s)]
*  I seen a girl, right? [[02:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=7280.96s)]
*  Her lips looked like they were getting ready to be, [[02:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=7282.6s)]
*  like they'd been in a burn. [[02:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=7286.16s)]
*  Like just like inflated to probably six, [[02:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=7287.48s)]

*  I don't know why. Curious about it. [[02:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=7443.08s)]
*  I just he Sam Altman, the AI crowd just freaks me out on a spiritual level. [[02:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=7444.56s)]
*  And sometimes it's just your gut. [[02:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=7449.12s)]
*  And I'm going with my gut. [[02:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=7450.68s)]
*  I think is God intuition. [[02:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=7452.04s)]
*  And they just freak me the hell out. [[02:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=7454.04s)]
*  Well, here's the thing I thought about. [[02:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=7455.68s)]
*  They even all look weird, like they look like they're robots, you know? [[02:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=7456.84s)]
*  Well, here's the thing. They come from another planet. [[02:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=7459.52s)]
*  A lot of the inventors and creators now have. [[02:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=7461.36s)]
*  And I think a lot of people would say that they possibly have some type of autism, right? [[02:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=7464.32s)]
*  A little bit of it, right? [[02:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=7468.84s)]
*  And I think that's that's not debated by a lot of them. [[02:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=7469.6s)]
*  That's fine. That's pretty normal. [[02:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=7472.56s)]
*  But a lot of autistic people, they are good with concepts, right? [[02:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=7474.64s)]
*  But they're not as good a lot of times with emotions, right? [[02:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=7479.12s)]
*  Not in the practical way that people without autism seem to be. [[02:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=7482.64s)]
*  So that's what I'm saying. [[02:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=7487.0s)]
*  We're getting more products that are created that have less emotion in them [[02:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=7488.28s)]
*  and are more just practical. [[02:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=7493.16s)]
*  Right. Because that's the type of people that the creativity is going through. [[02:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=7495.16s)]
*  Yeah. And that scares me. Right. [[02:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=7499.16s)]
*  So I think they're like, well, why do we need a woman when we can create an artificial womb? [[02:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=7500.36s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah, I don't like that. [[02:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=7504.52s)]
*  I feel like we should maybe pause and think about that before we all sign up. [[02:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=7506.08s)]
*  Yeah. You don't want to be at the club and you're just you're just grinding up [[02:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=7509.64s)]
*  on some electronic womb in the corner. [[02:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=7513.44s)]
*  That's how I feel. [[02:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=7515.76s)]
*  Like, I feel like that's we're going to get with these people. [[02:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=7516.6s)]
*  And he has a lot of kids. [[02:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=7518.92s)]
*  Shake it like a doll, baby. Do what you do. [[02:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=7520.0s)]
*  That song comes on and people are just just grinding up against like some electric [[02:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=7522.12s)]
*  womb or you put a quarter in it or whatever to get to line up. [[02:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=7527.36s)]
*  Yeah. Line up to get pregnant sort of a thing. [[02:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=7530.08s)]
*  I don't like any of it. [[02:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=7531.96s)]
*  It makes me scared and they just make me uncomfortable. [[02:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=7533.08s)]
*  And that's all I can say. [[02:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=7535.76s)]
*  I'm like, listen, I know I don't have like you say, I don't have the information, [[02:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=7537.08s)]
*  but I have the intuition that like we're barreling towards this like AI future [[02:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=7540.88s)]
*  and the lack of emotion just makes me uncomfortable. [[02:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=7544.96s)]
*  I'm like, OK, but these are humans. [[02:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=7548.320000000001s)]
*  They're like, but here's how we can solve the human problem. [[02:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=7549.96s)]
*  Yeah. Maybe they are aliens. [[02:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=7552.400000000001s)]
*  Press one. Yeah. [[02:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlHJTDBmZAs&t=7554.6s)]
