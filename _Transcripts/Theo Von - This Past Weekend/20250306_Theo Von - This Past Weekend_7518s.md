*  Yeah, they have him like in now in like in Nordstrom. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=129.0s)]
*  And it's like a... [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=131.0s)]
*  They have like a head over like... [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=132.0s)]
*  I think it was like right after like G-Star kind of came out. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=134.0s)]
*  Like G... [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=136.0s)]
*  I got into some G-Star for a bit. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=137.0s)]
*  Oh, you got some G-Star? [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=139.0s)]
*  That was like as like... [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=140.0s)]
*  Let me see what we're doing kind of as I got. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=142.0s)]
*  I would like to have more fashion sometimes. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=144.0s)]
*  I just don't know if I can... [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=146.0s)]
*  I don't care. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=148.0s)]
*  Well, you got to look. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=149.0s)]
*  I get too overwhelmed. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=151.0s)]
*  I like knowing like there's about 17 or 18 things that I wear that'll be okay. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=152.0s)]
*  Bro, you got to look. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=156.0s)]
*  You can't be saying, I need to get into fashion. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=157.0s)]
*  And you're making a deliberate choice to not have a mustache and grow a beard out. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=160.0s)]
*  Oh, you think so? [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=164.0s)]
*  I feel like that's a look. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=165.0s)]
*  Maybe that. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=167.0s)]
*  I never thought about that. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=168.0s)]
*  You got the flannel. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=170.0s)]
*  It's that little bit like a sock for your chin kind of I guess. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=172.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's brave by the way. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=174.0s)]
*  I just got to say. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=176.0s)]
*  To do just this? [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=177.0s)]
*  Yeah, I think it's brave. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=178.0s)]
*  But do you think that's a cultural thing? [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=179.0s)]
*  What culture is your family from? [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=181.0s)]
*  I'm Turkish. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=183.0s)]
*  Okay, so in Turkey, is that a thing? [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=184.0s)]
*  Do you see just this ever in Turkey? [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=186.0s)]
*  Sometimes. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=188.0s)]
*  We don't got Amish people. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=190.0s)]
*  Normally the only time you see the beard and the no mustache combo is if they just go with the full one. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=192.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=197.0s)]
*  And it's just like, I don't know why they do that. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=198.0s)]
*  Yeah, I saw a guy with a huge beard the other night at a comedy show. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=200.0s)]
*  I think it was in Ohio. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=204.0s)]
*  He had a huge beard and then a Edgar, that kind of Mexican kind of Edgar cut in the front. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=205.0s)]
*  I love that. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=210.0s)]
*  Oh, it was great. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=211.0s)]
*  This guy was ginger. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=212.0s)]
*  I mean probably Amish or recently Amish once removed or whatever. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=213.0s)]
*  And he had had like. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=218.0s)]
*  How does that work? [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=220.0s)]
*  I mean you could tell somebody in his watch. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=221.0s)]
*  Somebody had fucking. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=223.0s)]
*  He probably had nails in his pocket. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=224.0s)]
*  He definitely somebody had somebody. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=226.0s)]
*  I don't know, man. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=229.0s)]
*  But no, you're probably the most I'm trying to think of somebody else more stylish that's come in here. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=230.0s)]
*  Oh, here's some facial hair types right here. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=235.0s)]
*  This is very important. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=237.0s)]
*  Bro, this is like that that Russian ethnicities photo grid. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=238.0s)]
*  You know what I'm talking about? [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=242.0s)]
*  Like in the USSR, this is crazy. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=244.0s)]
*  It does look like. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=246.0s)]
*  Yeah, they're like they're showing us the different kinds of Armenians. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=247.0s)]
*  It does look like 40 different kinds of Armenians. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=252.0s)]
*  Like 40 degrees of Uber. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=255.0s)]
*  That's what it looks like. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=257.0s)]
*  Yeah, look, that's what I'm talking about. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=258.0s)]
*  Oh, I thought this is one of those tear watch. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=260.0s)]
*  No, no, no. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=262.0s)]
*  This is like look at look at all the different ethnicities in the USSR. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=264.0s)]
*  It's the it's the it's to be better at races. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=267.0s)]
*  Racism. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=270.0s)]
*  Well, that's what I do. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=271.0s)]
*  Racism used to be so easy in America. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=273.0s)]
*  Like when I was growing up, it was like easy, easy to do, easy to be racist. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=275.0s)]
*  Now I've been to these. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=279.0s)]
*  It's almost like you have to have a chart. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=281.0s)]
*  You have to have. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=283.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's what I calculated to even be racist. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=285.0s)]
*  Now it feels like. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=287.0s)]
*  Yeah, I hate that. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=288.0s)]
*  God damn it. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=291.0s)]
*  Racism used to be so easy. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=292.0s)]
*  The good old days. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=294.0s)]
*  You can just point out the window and your stepdad just knew immediately what was going on. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=295.0s)]
*  Yeah, I think it's just it's just extra difficulty now. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=300.0s)]
*  That's what it is. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=305.0s)]
*  So you have to be smarter as a racist. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=307.0s)]
*  There's a race is better. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=310.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=312.0s)]
*  Yeah, dude, because you said there's like a barrier to entry now. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=313.0s)]
*  Yeah, there's a there's a barrier entry to doing racism. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=316.0s)]
*  It's like it's it's unironically a more difficult process now. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=319.0s)]
*  But what I was going to say is if you want to go back to the to the facial hair, [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=325.0s)]
*  bring it up again, please, because I want to know what we're doing. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=331.0s)]

*  Yeah, thanks for having me. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=510.0s)]
*  I know you're super busy, man. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=512.0s)]
*  I admire I admire, first of all, how streamers how the effort it is. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=513.0s)]
*  It almost seems like it's like one of those races in the Olympics that it's like like an endurance game. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=520.0s)]
*  But also just like your openness to like thinking about things. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=526.0s)]
*  You don't seem like just like one type of person. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=529.0s)]
*  Yeah, I do. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=532.0s)]
*  I do a little bit of everything. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=533.0s)]
*  I mean, but even just in your own beliefs, I can you know, and when you talk about political stuff, it's like you seem very poignant, but also like aggressively open to things, you know, which I think and that's a judgment. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=534.0s)]
*  And maybe I shouldn't have said something like that. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=547.0s)]
*  But anyway, I just admire the way that you do things, dude. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=548.0s)]
*  So I appreciate you coming and hanging out. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=551.0s)]
*  That's all I said. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=552.0s)]
*  Thanks for thanks for having me. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=553.0s)]
*  I I appreciate you. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=555.0s)]
*  I think streamers are basically like the bottom of the totem pole as far as content creators goes like it's definitely laborious, but I wouldn't say that it's like super difficult because like overall a Hollywood production. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=557.0s)]
*  If it's if that is like the highest stage of like content creation and you have, you know, hundreds of people working all around the world working around the world. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=570.0s)]
*  To put like two and a half hours of content together where everyone's going to sit there and watch Twitch streaming is like the lowest of the low. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=580.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=588.0s)]
*  Where it's just like a dude like me half the time, you know, picking at his crotch watching YouTube videos picking his nose and it's you know, it's you have to be on for eight hours at a time and it's like usually one hour. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=589.0s)]
*  And that's annoying and you got to be like constantly listening to people chirp at you and that part sucks. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=600.0s)]
*  But overall I would say it's like the lowest tier of content, lowest effort of content. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=606.0s)]
*  Would you say that it's the purest of content though in a weird way? [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=611.0s)]
*  Like because it's I mean what I do is I hide. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=614.0s)]
*  Yeah. What I do is am radio. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=618.0s)]

*  She kind of looks like Walter White's wife [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=709.8s)]
*  You know what I mean? Oh, yeah breaking bad the blonde haired lady. Yeah [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=712.52s)]

*  She looked like if you go back one Tori spelling was probably for your time, but oh, yes, she does [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=719.6999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I never looked at his wife. Yeah, I never seen a picture of her before [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=724.76s)]
*  Yeah, I mean it'd be weird if you were just like out there googling Rush Limbaugh's life [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=729.58s)]
*  I do that all the time. I look at all the all my favorite conservative commentators wives [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=735.34s)]
*  You just think like yeah, I guess what are people's I don't know. Yeah. Yeah, I guess it's good that I'm not doing that [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=740.74s)]
*  What's one of the toughest things about streaming that people don't understand though? [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=745.98s)]
*  I'll say it like this back in the day Joe Rogan used to always talk about how when you do a three-hour podcast [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=749.7800000000001s)]
*  Like there are so much that people can just like clip out of that and then take [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=757.66s)]
*  out of context like rob it of its nuance and rob it of its context and [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=762.1s)]
*  It was funny because like at the time when he was saying this like podcasting was a relatively new medium [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=766.22s)]
*  I'm talking like [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=771.0600000000001s)]
*  2014 2015 when Joe wrote when when he like first was building out the Joe Rogan experience, right? [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=772.98s)]
*  Every other week seemingly the media would yell at him over some shit that he said on his podcast [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=779.16s)]
*  And he was like we're having an honest discussion. It's three hours. It's back and forth [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=785.26s)]
*  It's gonna happen like things are gonna get taken out of context. I [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=788.7s)]
*  Think for twitch streaming that's tuned up to 11 where not only in my live. I'm talking about politics [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=793.0600000000001s)]
*  Which are you know, I mean I'm talking about some really [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=800.62s)]
*  crazy issues hot button topics and [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=803.38s)]
*  Also, I'm doing that with a live audience who's constantly chirping at me [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=807.38s)]
*  in real time [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=812.34s)]
*  Trying to you know trying to constantly piss me off and then when they do successfully piss me off [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=814.14s)]
*  They'll clip that shit and post it on Twitter post it on ready to be like call out post call out post [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=820.1s)]
*  this guy's bad look at what he said and [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=824.9399999999999s)]
*  You know when you got like crazy dedicated haters to especially because you're doing politics in general [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=828.38s)]
*  You're gonna have a lot of crazy dedicated haters [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=832.98s)]
*  They they just do you know, they just compile all of that to be like [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=836.3s)]
*  This is a bad person over and over and over again [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=839.9399999999999s)]
*  like you'll see it in the in the comments section of this video there will be a [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=842.26s)]
*  Ton of people who are gonna come in and be like this guy is a bad dude [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=846.14s)]
*  like he said this he said that cuz like [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=849.78s)]
*  The major reason obviously for that is because I'm anti-israel like I'm I'm I'm pro-palestine [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=852.74s)]
*  I've been pro-palestine for quite a while and that really brings out the crazies. Oh, yeah. Oh [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=858.6999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, you haven't encountered this I mean you had Gabor Monte on yeah, we had Gabor Monte we had a rabbi [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=867.34s)]
*  We had by some you step on we definitely have tried to like learn some about it [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=876.42s)]
*  I think in the end for me it just became like [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=880.08s)]
*  my feelings just tell me that it's [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=883.14s)]
*  Just messed up what's happening those people it's like and that a lot of it was covered up by the media [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=886.38s)]
*  Or they didn't want you to share certain information or you weren't allowed to no for sure [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=890.86s)]
*  I mean, that's how it's always been though. It's not just for Israel. It's just in general like when it comes to American foreign policy [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=894.98s)]
*  The the American media is fairly one-note our politicians are one known on it, too. They're bipartisan on that, right? [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=902.74s)]
*  That's like so when you say that do you mean that they're all in on the same? [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=909.9s)]
*  It's all kind of the same ruse. Do you mean yeah? Yeah, they all they all agree [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=912.98s)]
*  It's always uniparty when it comes to American foreign policy when it comes to giving money to Israel when it comes to a lot [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=917.6800000000001s)]
*  Of that stuff like going to war with Iraq, right? [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=924.02s)]
*  You got the media also presenting that lie that they have, you know chemical weapons [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=927.98s)]
*  They're weapons of mass destruction and uncritically reporting on that to justify going to war [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=933.62s)]
*  With Iraq going and invading a foreign nation that we had no business invading right so that is [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=939.62s)]
*  That happens all the time. Do you think that that's starting to get upset even by like podcasting streaming? [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=946.1s)]
*  Do you think that that Apple cart starting to change it feels like oh for sure I think that [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=954.06s)]
*  Yeah, the independent media sphere definitely is like dominating partially because of that reason [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=961.8199999999999s)]
*  Sometimes for bad reasons people have lost confidence in media when they just don't like what they're reporting [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=966.8199999999999s)]
*  even if they're reporting the truth and then there are plenty of major reasons like [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=972.1s)]
*  Like Jeffrey Epstein's death like you go to any outlet most of them are gonna rule it as suicide [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=977.3s)]
*  No critical no critical reporting on it whatsoever just unconditionally saying like no no, it was definitely like [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=982.42s)]
*  The average American doesn't feel that way and also there's very valid reasons as to why they don't feel that way [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=989.38s)]
*  Israel is another great example of this where like it was like 80% of Americans wanted to ceasefire [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=995.58s)]
*  And and yet if you look at all the way from CNN to Fox News [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=1002.42s)]
*  Every single outlet was just like no no no you don't understand Israel has to kill these children [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=1008.2199999999999s)]
*  No, you don't understand like can you imagine you got? [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=1014.3s)]
*  Imagine a role reversal in that situation where like you got you got [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=1020.26s)]
*  Osama bin Laden's best lads on CNN immediately after 9-eleven being like listen [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=1025.6599999999999s)]
*  Like we we had the blow up the Twin Towers like you don't the World Trade Center [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=1031.7s)]
*  It was it was right there was asking for it one of them was a little skew. Yeah. Yeah, we had to fix it [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=1036.78s)]
*  Yeah, well yeah, it's crazy [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=1044.06s)]
*  Well, there's that famous video they got shared a few years ago like during kovat when it was like [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=1046.02s)]
*  Every channel was reporting the same exact. It was just the same script. It was almost just their broadcasting [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=1049.9799999999998s)]
*  Yeah, so that's actually that's ironically a lot of right-wingers spread that one is that true or not? [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=1055.1599999999999s)]
*  No, it is but that but that's right wing this that's Sinclair broadcasting [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=1060.4599999999998s)]
*  It's like a right-wing media company that basically bought out all the remaining local news broadcasters. Wow, so it's like an umbrella [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=1064.62s)]
*  Right-wing media is all over the place actually and a lot of people don't realize it like when [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=1071.6599999999999s)]
*  Whenever Fox News talks about like mainstream media lies. I'm like, bro. You are the most popular news network in the country [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=1077.3799999999999s)]
*  What do you mean mainstream media like you're dominating everybody else? [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=1083.3799999999999s)]
*  So you're saying that a lot of times [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=1087.54s)]
*  A [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=1089.8999999999999s)]
*  Mainstream media is also right-wing media [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=1091.1s)]
*  Yeah, right-wing media is so dominant and in the independent side right-wing media is dominant as hell too [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=1094.18s)]
*  But like on the mainstream side right-wing media is incredibly dominant. They dominate the local news [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=1100.1399999999999s)]
*  with Sinclair broadcasting and also all the way up to Fox News is the most famous which is the most like successful [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=1106.3799999999999s)]
*  Network news [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=1113.38s)]
*  Broadcaster in the country is Fox is Fox News the most watched news network by widest margins really? [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=1115.18s)]
*  Yeah, it's not even close CNN MSNB Trump always talks about how CNN NBC are, you know in the pooper [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=1122.22s)]
*  Their ratings are awful. These guys love presenting themselves as vulnerable victims and I and I really always get annoyed by that [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=1128.3400000000001s)]
*  like they say that about [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=1135.26s)]
*  They used to always say that about like Facebook too [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=1136.8200000000002s)]
*  Like all their banning stuff and I'm sure they banned like vaccine denial or whatever, right? [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=1139.3799999999999s)]
*  Because Facebook wanted to be woke and liberal [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=1144.46s)]
*  until Mark Zuckerberg got hit with the Dominican ray, but [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=1147.94s)]
*  So then when people say mainstream media then I guess what then what did it because it always felt to me like [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=1152.1399999999999s)]
*  Yeah that every outlet was just always super liberal that's what it felt like they are no [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=1159.1399999999999s)]
*  No, for sure like a lot of like the New York Times you got [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=1164.34s)]
*  CNN ABC CBS like NBC these outlets are liberal now, obviously [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=1168.28s)]
*  I'm a little bit of a radical I guess so I'm [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=1173.86s)]
*  Definitely not fond of the Democratic Party either even though [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=1178.28s)]
*  My criticisms of the Democrats are because of their closeness to the Republicans in general [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=1181.6799999999998s)]
*  But yeah, they are I would say that they're definitely liberal [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=1187.32s)]
*  but that doesn't necessarily mean that they're like on the side of the people or anything like that or [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=1190.6799999999998s)]
*  On even the progressive side of many of the many of these issues and that's why I said [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=1195.32s)]
*  There is this uniparty attitude like liberals and Republicans [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=1200.32s)]
*  They basically come together and agree when it comes to giving more money to Israel [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=1205.28s)]
*  Yeah, not not the voters. I'm talking like institutions. I'm talking politicians. Yeah [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=1210.16s)]
*  Well, that's yeah that seems to be I think it feels so far away from being [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=1215.44s)]
*  Represented like the people feel so far away from being represented and I feel like that seems like it's gotten further and further in my lifetime [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=1221.6799999999998s)]
*  I can't tell if it's just because I'm getting older and so you hear about more stuff like that or if it's [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=1228.8s)]
*  actually true, but I think people just feel like [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=1234.84s)]
*  You know, like why are we having to audit our own government, you know [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=1238.32s)]
*  whether or not the means that they're going about it or good or not, but it's like [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=1241.54s)]

*  Whatever, but it's like I think if you're all if your military is so great send in snipers and get the bad guys [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=1476.1s)]
*  That's how I feel do some covert option, but just to be like their military's ass though. That's the problem [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=1483.46s)]
*  they just have like they just have [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=1489.22s)]
*  Overwhelming firepower and air superiority. That's it. But but but that's the part to me [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=1492.8999999999999s)]
*  It's like send in some, you know [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=1497.78s)]
*  If those are the bad guys send in and get the like do some it just felt like this [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=1499.32s)]

*  You could not hide from the world that what they were doing was wrong [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=1510.78s)]
*  But going back to what you're saying, how much are we complicit in so many of these? [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=1514.82s)]
*  I mean types of things that happen in different countries and do we [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=1520.18s)]

*  that's why I actively urge people to protest and do everything in their power to [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=1531.5s)]
*  Try to put an end to this because I think we have a lot of power in this in this regard in the United States of America [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=1536.02s)]
*  I don't think that America is like a true democracy by any means and this kind of stuff basically [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=1542.3400000000001s)]

*  Candace always got a lot of thoughts on that stuff. I think I think there's like two different camps here [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=1754.76s)]
*  You got people who critically analyzed the relationship with Israel and you got people who are like it's the Jews, you know [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=1760.24s)]
*  I am and the critically analyzing the situation camp rather than just being like us Jews because they got mind control powers [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=1767.04s)]
*  Whatever the fuck people say [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=1774.2s)]
*  it's it's because it is an unsinkable aircraft carrier in a resource rich region and it has its own espionage facilities and [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=1776.44s)]
*  That is the reason like we basically carried over from the British [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=1785.44s)]
*  This this settler colony in the region that we can just kind of use [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=1789.52s)]
*  Or have a collaborative relationship with and it's incredibly valuable for us so valuable that like I mean Israel's blown up [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=1796.12s)]
*  USS Liberty like a like an American Navy ship and and basically those in the 50s [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=1804.4799999999998s)]
*  I think yeah in that process like it was an incredibly valuable Cold War ally [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=1810.28s)]
*  Because we were terrified of Israel going in like collaborating with the USSR. You got pan [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=1815.4799999999998s)]
*  Arabic nationalism happening all around the region all these countries that are developing nation states are [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=1820.4s)]
*  doing so on the boundaries of you know, defeating their their colonial occupiers, whether it be French colonialism or British colonialism and [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=1826.8s)]
*  Simultaneously, they're looking to the USSR right and they're like, you know, maybe you guys will help us out [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=1836.48s)]
*  This seems like a cool thing that you guys got going on over there. The socialism stuff ain't too bad [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=1841.88s)]
*  America goes fuck that [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=1847.32s)]
*  And they basically hit the Israel button as hard as they could where they were just like you guys are gonna be our [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=1850.08s)]
*  You guys are gonna be our extension, right? It's like [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=1856.26s)]
*  some of my friends say [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=1861.04s)]
*  There are favorite client states and then there are client states that America just discards [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=1863.04s)]
*  Ukraine is obviously a non favored client state and that's what happens when you're done with Ukraine where you're like [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=1868.2s)]
*  I'm done with this, you know pack it up [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=1874.52s)]
*  Give me all your minerals, even if you have any who knows I don't care, you know know your place [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=1876.96s)]
*  America does this to the Kurds all the time as well or they'll just like arm them and be like, yeah [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=1882.96s)]
*  You guys need to get you guys need to develop a nation state. It'd be nice Kurds are ethnic minority in the region [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=1887.68s)]
*  Okay, 35 million people in what in the in the Middle East 35 million people don't have a nation state [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=1893.5200000000002s)]
*  A lot of them live in Turkey. So kind of homeless rock [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=1901.0400000000002s)]
*  Well, yeah, yes and no and and there's like varying degrees of cruelty that they're subjected to in these countries is like an ethnic minority [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=1904.26s)]
*  my country included in Turkey Wow and [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=1911.3400000000001s)]
*  They want to they want to build a nation state they got an autonomous region in Iraq now they're in Syria as well [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=1915.5s)]
*  They're in Iran as well. And then they're trying to figure it out. Yes. So America will go up to them and be like [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=1921.9s)]
*  We're gonna arm you guys. We're gonna train you guys go fuck shit up [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=1927.48s)]
*  And then as soon as they're done they they just discard them and they're like, okay go you can they'll tell Turkey you can go [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=1930.4199999999998s)]
*  And you know bomb these villages that they're in who cares it doesn't matter anymore [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=1937.26s)]
*  So what you're saying, I think it's like that that's one of the things that makes it tougher the more information you learn [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=1940.5s)]
*  I think in the world. It's like [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=1946.06s)]
*  The shittier thing seem yeah in some ways, but the reality of things you just see the reality. It's like yeah, you need [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=1948.1s)]
*  And if you were playing a game of risk and you were these dick to you or these powerful people [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=1955.82s)]
*  how would you operate and [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=1960.82s)]
*  yeah, it just gets to it gets to be tough to [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=1962.7s)]
*  Find out. Okay. Well, then what is being an American still mean to me and then also that things are so [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=1966.5s)]
*  conflicting and dangerous out there amongst these like leaders and powers that you have to [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=1973.54s)]
*  You have to like kind of put a flag in something for yourself, you know [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=1980.58s)]
*  just [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=1985.46s)]
*  To kind of get to because otherwise you'll just be sort of aimless. It feels like [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=1986.66s)]
*  Well, I mean, I think I don't know if I'm even explaining that fully right [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=1991.78s)]
*  But you got a stand for some is over your saying if you don't stand for some you fall for everything [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=1995.3s)]
*  Yeah, so here's what I think is like the more we learn about [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=1999.9s)]
*  History the more we learn about just like [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=2004.06s)]
*  the [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=2006.74s)]
*  They're like well [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=2008.34s)]
*  America did these things and some of it [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=2010.3s)]
*  9-eleven could have been the result of some of that just as more as you start to learn that America hasn't always been this perfect [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=2012.82s)]
*  Partner and this that it just starts to test like okay. Well, what does it mean to be an American to me? [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=2018.5s)]
*  But then at the same time you need to be an American because you live in a country that's safe and you're able to operate here [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=2024.1s)]
*  Within the country so it's I don't know. It just makes it kind of interesting. Does that make sense? [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=2031.86s)]
*  No, I get it what you're what you're exhibiting is is a very normal contradiction that a lot of Americans [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=2035.86s)]
*  When faced with the reality of American foreign policy [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=2043.3s)]
*  They they come to terms with this like they try to they try to resolve this contradiction where on the one hand you're saying [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=2046.3799999999999s)]
*  Well, I'm an American. I like the security blanket that I exist under right but also simultaneously [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=2051.8599999999997s)]
*  Sometimes you're like but damn we're doing a lot of fucked up shit around the world [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=2058.74s)]
*  I mean look, I'm a [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=2062.54s)]
*  People always yell at me and say oh Hassan you only say America bad [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=2064.7s)]
*  But I don't just stop at that like I I want America to be good. I think America has an incredible potential [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=2069.7799999999997s)]
*  It's the wealthiest nation on the planet. It should be doing so much more [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=2076.02s)]
*  to to help its own citizens and [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=2080.66s)]
*  So much more to lead the way pave the way for a new evolution of the way that we look at international relations than the way [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=2084.14s)]
*  that we engage with conflict [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=2090.72s)]
*  But [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=2093.52s)]
*  The reason why America is the way it is is because I see it as basically, you know [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=2094.7599999999998s)]
*  50 corporations in a trance suit like it's just it's it's a holdover to extract tax revenue from [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=2099.3599999999997s)]
*  Everyday Americans and then give it directly back to corporations in the form of subsidies without ever regulating them and and you know [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=2106.8399999999997s)]
*  Demanding anything in return. I think one of the best examples of this was when you know, Russia invaded Ukraine [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=2114.3999999999996s)]
*  And then Russia is also part of OPEC plus so they went back to Saudi Arabia. Take us back our listeners if we get too much [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=2122.7599999999998s)]
*  Information a lot of them don't they're gonna tune it out [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=2129.64s)]
*  Well, then it's I think it's if it's new information for me [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=2132.52s)]
*  I shouldn't say them if it's new information for me, it's hard for me to go along. So oh, why are you throwing one of the buzz? [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=2134.9599999999996s)]
*  My bad guys, I'm the I am the problem so but OPEC is the oil. Yeah, so OPEC is that like an oil NATO? [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=2142.56s)]
*  Yeah, basically exactly it's a cartel. Okay, that's what it is. It's a it's a it's a group of of [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=2150.32s)]
*  Countries that have oil reserves that basically set the the price of oil barrels [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=2157.8s)]
*  Okay, and Saudi Arabia is pretty dominant because like they have [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=2163.8s)]
*  You know, I mean they they're the oil [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=2168.04s)]
*  Yeah, and yeah the Organization of Petroleum exporting countries and [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=2170.96s)]
*  Russia basically went back to OPEC and was like organization of petroleum exporting countries. Yeah. Okay. Yeah at the time [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=2176.36s)]
*  Russia had a lot to you know a lot to gain from and all these other countries had a lot to also gain from basically [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=2182.92s)]
*  limiting the price of or limiting the supply of oil [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=2190.2000000000003s)]
*  You know, we're in the post-covid era too and then like they're also [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=2193.96s)]
*  They were also making a lot of money and or they had lost a lot of revenue [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=2198.92s)]
*  Because nobody was like flying around or using oil because everyone was like [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=2203.64s)]
*  So they they were recouping on those losses by just basically saying demand is on an all-time high [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=2209.8399999999997s)]
*  We're not gonna produce, you know, we're not gonna keep up with that demand to make sure that we stabilize the prices [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=2216.56s)]
*  Right. So this hand others only so much oil even though there's as much as they're one they they kind of oh, yeah [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=2222.7s)]
*  They could have produced way more right. So the point I was gonna make is [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=2226.7599999999998s)]
*  Brandon went back to Saudi Arabia, you know, he shook hands with MBS and was like Brandon Brandon Joe Brandon Joe Biden [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=2231.12s)]
*  Oh Joe Biden. Yeah, he went to he went Saudi Arabia. He's like, come on Jack, you know [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=2238.2s)]
*  Produce more oil. Come on. Don't do it and and they were like, nope [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=2243.44s)]
*  the reason why I'm telling this convoluted story is because [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=2248.88s)]
*  Then we have American oil and gas industry providers, right? Like we have our own oil [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=2252.84s)]
*  Everybody always talks about how we we have independence like energy independence in America [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=2258.84s)]
*  So he went back to the American oil and gas industry and was like, alright [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=2264.5600000000004s)]
*  You guys have to you know produce more oil because you have to offset what like OPEC is doing and you know what they said [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=2269.0800000000004s)]
*  Fuck you. That's what they said [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=2276.36s)]
*  They get they rely the oil and gas producers in this country the fossil fuel industry gets 80% of our energy subsidies. It's like [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=2278.5600000000004s)]
*  Billions of dollars that they get so they get kickbacks from the government not even a kickback like [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=2286.02s)]
*  Government collects taxes and then government gives these companies whether they're in agriculture or whether they're in the oil and gas industry [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=2292.38s)]
*  They give money to these companies to keep prices relatively low to keep up with the cost of the production, right? [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=2299.42s)]
*  They're like, hey, we're gonna give you this money. So you keep prices low, but in a time [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=2305.78s)]
*  Because the gut because that company owns so much of the actual market of whatever that product is that if they wanted to adjust it [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=2310.74s)]
*  They could do it. Yeah [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=2317.3399999999997s)]
*  They didn't they didn't provide they just didn't supply the federal government with more oil like they just did not [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=2319.94s)]
*  They did not produce more in the time to stabilize prices and you got like the oil lobby guys going on [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=2327.62s)]
*  CNBC and actively being like we have a fiduciary responsibility to our shareholders to maximize profit [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=2335.62s)]
*  We don't care if the you know, we don't care if the prices are high, you know sucks to suck because our profits are great and [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=2342.38s)]
*  the reason why I explained all this is because I think that's a perfect demonstration of how America operates like the American government operates rather [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=2349.98s)]
*  Where it serves corporations not the people and then you got China on the other hand where like [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=2358.14s)]
*  It's you know, they got billionaires to they got massive corporations to but those corporations serve the government now that can be bad [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=2364.66s)]
*  but if the government is is [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=2372.7s)]
*  you know interested in in [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=2375.94s)]
*  Uplifting the great the public good and and doing like even development or whatever then [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=2378.8199999999997s)]
*  Ultimately, they just can force corporations hands to do whatever they want [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=2384.3799999999997s)]
*  Yeah, I mean like like you're saying it's like yeah the more you learn it's um [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=2388.98s)]
*  You have to then decide okay you almost have to differentiate [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=2393.94s)]
*  Well, what does it mean to be an American to me? [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=2399.62s)]
*  You know because if I stay here and I sleep under this banner of America where I can make money and I can have and [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=2402.58s)]
*  There's a welfare system and albeit there, you know people have ideas of whether they're good or bad and those [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=2408.78s)]
*  But but that I stay here I continue to stay I keep myself here this where I choose to be [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=2415.46s)]
*  You know in the safety of this place, mm-hmm [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=2421.1s)]
*  You know, it's like well how complicit am I or am I just an American and this is this is the I got blessed [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=2426.14s)]
*  into this place and this is where I am and [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=2431.3399999999997s)]
*  If somebody else weren't born in this place and they were in a place that were [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=2433.42s)]
*  You know more hostile and scary to live in and sleep in and try to survive in [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=2436.8199999999997s)]
*  Wouldn't they be praying that they would be here that they would have some of the same things? Yeah, everyone everyone make any sense [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=2441.06s)]
*  No, it does. Yeah. No, you what you're describing. Like I said is is [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=2446.9s)]
*  What left is what left is called like living in the Imperial Corps? [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=2450.78s)]
*  Because if you're in the if you're in the heart of Empire you at the very least don't suffer the repercussions of being the victims [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=2455.02s)]
*  Right, right. Like you're not you're not in Guatemala [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=2461.7000000000003s)]
*  So you're not getting destabilized by the American government in many instances like or at least throughout your history [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=2464.42s)]
*  So you haven't been kept down [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=2469.94s)]
*  And and therefore your situation in comparison to them is gonna be a lot better and then what I want my life to be like [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=2472.54s)]
*  Day to day do I want it to be this? [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=2478.9s)]
*  Constant neck like or do I want to not think about those things and think that those are the government's you know? [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=2480.86s)]
*  Some of that's the government's responsibility [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=2487.06s)]
*  I do my best to elect and vote in a way that I think is [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=2488.94s)]
*  Meaningful and vote for the best person and then I try to enjoy my life and take care of my family and my neighbor [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=2492.42s)]
*  You know, I think it's like I don't know [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=2497.46s)]
*  That's kind of how I think maybe I start to break it down in my head, you know, yeah, so [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=2499.44s)]
*  That bait that that what you were describing right there is is [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=2504.84s)]
*  Basically the heart of I wouldn't say the problem necessarily [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=2509.84s)]
*  But that that is why a lot of people just like tune out because they feel just powerless at the end of the day [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=2513.48s)]
*  You know, you got your protests you vote and then these guys do whatever the fuck they want to do [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=2518.36s)]
*  what am I supposed to do is like the the attitude that the average citizen has in this country and [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=2522.8s)]
*  You know, that's why things slowly but surely [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=2528.44s)]
*  Seemingly get worse year over year [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=2532.2s)]
*  Maybe not for you and I cuz like I mean we're relatively successful [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=2534.3599999999997s)]
*  but for like average people for everyday people shit is fucked up and [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=2538.3599999999997s)]
*  They recognize it but they don't know who is responsible for it and they become so malleable and so open [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=2543.12s)]
*  to responding to anybody that will look at [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=2549.96s)]
*  Anybody that will recognize their frustration and say it's actually because of this and that and I think Trump tapped into that so perfectly [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=2554.2799999999997s)]
*  And that's why he won. That's why he defeated the Democrats. So handily because he was like, yes, you're angry [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=2561.8399999999997s)]
*  I'm angry too. Why are you angry? Cuz woke libtards cuz DEI cuz trans people cuz you know undocumented immigrants [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=2569.0s)]
*  Undocumented immigrants aren't your fucking landlord. They're not the one who's raising the price of rent [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=2578.24s)]
*  They don't own the they don't own the mega corporations. They don't they're not they're not sitting at the board of BlackRock [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=2582.16s)]
*  You know what? I mean, it's not a Guatemalan migrant that's sitting at the board of BlackRock [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=2587.56s)]
*  purchasing all the fucking houses or [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=2591.72s)]
*  they're not the real estate developers that refuse to you know, add to the like [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=2593.92s)]
*  Much needed supply of housing. Yeah, and instead put a fucking rag and bone in every town [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=2599.84s)]
*  Fucking hate rag. Well, it's just like dude. Don't tear down cool areas and just put up a rag and bone, dude [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=2606.08s)]
*  It's not fucking cool. But no, I mean, it's interesting. I never really heard it put like that like and [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=2611.24s)]
*  Then of course the other things you say these other things to people that doesn't feel [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=2617.12s)]
*  You got us point you have to approach people with something they can point a finger at and it's called there [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=2622.52s)]
*  Whatever they're pointing that is close enough where they feel like [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=2627.64s)]
*  It can be reached. Yeah, like those are things that it's like [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=2632.3199999999997s)]
*  But also those are things like you you label like it's Trump talked about him last night on some of the congressional address [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=2637.36s)]
*  I think it was the party address [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=2643.48s)]
*  That's right. Yeah, he did a he did like a fake state of the union [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=2645.96s)]
*  It was a joint congressional address congressional address. Yeah, cuz he talked about some of those things like DEI [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=2649.6s)]
*  Yeah, bro, they cut the I now planes are fucking falling out of the sky man [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=2655.1600000000003s)]
*  We need to bring Pete Buttigieg back as the transportation secretary. He needs to fix the problem. Was he a dog in there? [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=2659.08s)]
*  No, we need black policy first of all black people can jump better. So are you not gonna have a fucking black dude in a plane, bro? [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=2665.2s)]
*  I don't know. I don't know about the jumping. I don't know [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=2672.96s)]
*  factor into the to the [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=2677.04s)]
*  to the pilot program [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=2679.16s)]
*  But still do you if I see if I saw Michael Jordan the cockpit that bitch we gonna stay up [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=2681.08s)]
*  That's how I'm Oh 100% like that's where I feel now. I now now I think on [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=2686.04s)]
*  You know now we if I get on a plane and I see a white man that dude better be in a polyamorous relationship [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=2691.68s)]
*  Okay, I need that dude sucking dick. Okay, I need I need something [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=2698.8s)]
*  I need if he's straight and he's a he's a straight white male that plane is falling dude. That's what's going on [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=2703.94s)]
*  Trump came in he killed DEI every day. There's another fucking plane crash [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=2710.48s)]
*  Here's the fuck I'm not being serious [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=2716.2s)]
*  Even though even though Republicans do think that that is real where they're like, oh if there's a black woman pilot [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=2719.28s)]
*  That's why planes are falling. It's like no dumbass is because of fucking capitalism [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=2724.68s)]
*  Like Dave they've literally undercut every aspect of production to make more money. They constantly outsource [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=2728.68s)]
*  They constantly send certain aspects of manufacturing to to other countries where there's like less regulation and less restrictions [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=2735.12s)]
*  that makes them more money and [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=2742.88s)]
*  That's why fucking planes are you know, the doors are exploding and shit while they're flying and then is that one the reason [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=2745.48s)]
*  Is that one of the real reasons you think it's going on? That's 100% the reason why it's going on bring it up [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=2750.48s)]
*  See if we can that's a good question [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=2754.6800000000003s)]
*  Why are what because it there seems to be these little times in history where it's like, okay for this year [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=2756.04s)]
*  It's almost like they press a plane trouble button and it's like, oh now there's plane trouble [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=2762.2400000000002s)]
*  Well, that's also because you know minor incidents happen all the time [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=2766.48s)]
*  Right the media hyper focuses on them when it becomes like a hot-button topic, that's what it is [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=2771.08s)]
*  And and there are obviously freak accidents as well. Like they all freak accidents happen, but I think [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=2776.4s)]
*  there's never really like a like a [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=2783.92s)]
*  Perfect example like a perfect demonstration of why these things are happening more frequently. Yeah [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=2786.56s)]
*  Let me see what this even says know there were actually more plane crashes between January 1st [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=2792.52s)]
*  2024 and February 1st 2024 when you compare the same time period this year to last year [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=2796.7599999999998s)]
*  So there were more crashes, yeah, but the difference is the the [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=2803.96s)]
*  The severity of like one big crash and then people hyper focus on it this happened with the Palestine, Ohio [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=2809.2s)]
*  Remember when the train derailment happened and everybody's like why aren't they covering this? Well, you know, I'm I'm a little bit of a fomer [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=2816.72s)]
*  I love I love trains maybe it's because of the autism but like, you know [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=2824.36s)]
*  How many train derailments happening every year every single year a thousand some of them are minor some of them are major, right? [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=2828.8s)]
*  So every single person hyper focused on this understandably because like they try to do a shitty ass cover up for it and be like [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=2836.4s)]
*  Oh, no, everything is fine. And there was gas leaking. Yeah, there was death. Oh, you just feel itchy. It's normal [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=2843.44s)]
*  Yeah, drink of the water. It's fine that it's green, you know, shut up [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=2849.88s)]
*  but [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=2853.34s)]
*  Because of that then everybody started focusing on all these derailments and they were like what the hell's going on? [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=2854.7400000000002s)]
*  And it's like there's a lot of that that happens all the time [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=2859.46s)]
*  It's just the media doesn't pay attention to it because if you paid attention to it all the time you go crazy [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=2862.2200000000003s)]
*  It's like crime right crime in big cities. It's a constant. Oh, yeah, you know that is a [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=2867.1s)]
*  Buddy of mine was staying with me and he's from like the suburbs of Portland, right? [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=2873.82s)]
*  Just like a very white neighborhood and [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=2878.9s)]
*  I'm living I live in the middle of West Hollywood and you know, LA is not like New York or whatever, but it's still a city, right? [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=2881.7000000000003s)]
*  Every time he heard firecrackers or whatever like fireworks or whatever. He would freak out. Is that gunshots? [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=2889.26s)]
*  I'm like no, man. That's just fireworks. Like what are you talking about? And then he would hear like, you know [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=2895.26s)]
*  ambulances or police sirens he freaked out because like if you live in a suburb and you hear police sirens [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=2901.84s)]
*  Yeah, some some crazy happen, right? [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=2908.24s)]
*  But if you live in a city you hear it all the time is background noise because you know, there's always shit happening [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=2910.68s)]
*  There's you know, tens of millions of people around [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=2916.16s)]
*  So how you saying that relates to this? [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=2918.6s)]
*  The what what I mean by that is if you pay attention to it with apps like, you know [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=2920.96s)]
*  next door and citizen and ring and all this stuff you start [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=2926.38s)]
*  Realizing that like it's happening all the time and it makes you go crazy [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=2931.3199999999997s)]
*  Same with train derailment same with plane, you know plane crashes and whatnot [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=2935.16s)]
*  there are their normal part of this process and you got to look at the data and and [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=2939.7200000000003s)]
*  Try to figure out if this is like truly unique or not and in terms of the plane crashes [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=2945.4s)]
*  The the deadly nature of some of them is unique [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=2950.6s)]
*  There's been some big ones right like with the Ronald Reagan Airport one [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=2955.7200000000003s)]
*  But outside of that like, you know minor bumps at the Seattle Airport or whatever like that's normal [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=2958.84s)]
*  You had a couple of words like these planes almost he showed them [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=2963.34s)]
*  They would show you a video and I watched one of them two times [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=2965.7400000000002s)]
*  I'm like, I didn't that shit even look close to me. Yeah, like but they just label it that way [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=2967.7400000000002s)]
*  It's definitely kind of fascinating then once something happens you start to hyper focus on it more [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=2972.26s)]

*  There's there's one thing that transcends party boundaries and I feel like you [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=3131.86s)]

*  I [[01:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=3624.56s)]
*  Think people are like we don't give a fuck who's auditing this thing and finally there's like oh [[01:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=3626.32s)]
*  This is the person to audit. This is the person that's gonna audit. This is somebody we can blame if something fucks up [[01:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=3631.44s)]
*  Yeah, somebody that at least they're saying that they're gonna audit the government like [[01:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=3636.84s)]
*  Why why do we even have to audit our own government? Well, we we have see that's the problem [[01:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=3641.96s)]
*  We already have an auditing agency. So these guys unironically created an additional agency, which is redundant to eliminate redundancy [[01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=3646.8s)]
*  and [[01:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=3655.32s)]
*  That's interesting the the unfortunate side of this is that [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=3656.56s)]
*  they don't know what the fuck they're doing so they go in and they just like pull data and [[01:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=3661.08s)]
*  They basically make these public declarations about you know, a billion dollars is going to this or that [[01:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=3666.88s)]
*  Oh, yeah, like they they straight-up lied [[01:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=3673.24s)]
*  They were like, oh, yeah [[01:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=3675.12s)]
*  We already cut like 200 billion dollars of funds and then like the New York Times and all these other like actual investigative reporters went [[01:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=3675.84s)]
*  In looked at the data and they were like dude, that's a lot like there's one instance where they claimed that they cut eight billion dollars [[01:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=3681.52s)]
*  And they actually cut eight million dollars [[01:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=3688.6400000000003s)]
*  Like how do you carry over so many goddamn zeros? They're just like ah, fuck it. Who cares? [[01:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=3691.88s)]
*  No one will fact-check it. No one will look it up. Well, the crazy thing is though now you have [[01:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=3696.52s)]
*  You have whoever our original auditing system was and then you have this second and now we have this second auditing system [[01:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=3702.2400000000002s)]
*  but dude, it goes to like [[01:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=3708.76s)]

*  There's times and I probably should what I want to hire somebody to audit my financial advisor [[01:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=3721.44s)]
*  Because I'm like is this guy stealing money for me, you know [[01:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=3727.5200000000004s)]

*  That Elon or Doge is the best but it's like now it feels like okay [[01:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=3745.08s)]
*  Well, there's a government system that's supposed to be doing this and then there's a privatized system that's supposed to be doing this now [[01:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=3748.82s)]
*  Who's the crook? [[01:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=3755.24s)]

*  In his car and masturbate without feeling like you know, like people were gonna point at him or whatever. What though? [[01:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=4132.3s)]
*  Yo, that dude needs to be institutionalized [[01:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=4139.46s)]
*  No, put a fucking stray jacket on that motherfucker stop [[01:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=4143.38s)]
*  You he's got a he's got to be put in a room like like train spotting like he's got a quick cold turkey [[01:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=4146.66s)]
*  Like he's quitting heroin in Soho that's considered off-broadway. Yeah, no, no way, dude [[01:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=4151.76s)]
*  No render him immobile for like a week and oh [[01:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=4156.66s)]
*  My god the amount of the amount of energy that he probably has in there trapped in there if he doesn't jerk off or we [[01:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=4160.7s)]
*  Can start levitating? It's gonna come out of there like [[01:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=4166.74s)]
*  like a god [[01:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=4170.26s)]
*  His car to start running on his own [[01:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=4171.74s)]
*  On his own seam and whatever I shouldn't have said that part but [[01:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=4174.860000000001s)]
*  You had Bernie Sanders on your show I did you pretty cool man. How awesome was that? Yeah, he's the man [[01:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=4178.860000000001s)]
*  I love Bernie [[01:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=4184.5s)]
*  Did you find it interesting that people cheered so much against him when they said that he also took money during like remember that? [[01:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=4185.26s)]
*  A couple of months ago not a judgment against him. I think all these people I think when you get into politics, right? [[01:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=4190.42s)]
*  It's almost like being in a big family [[01:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=4196.620000000001s)]
*  And if you want something done it feels like you have to there's it's almost just like money from one though [[01:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=4198.14s)]
*  Well, what do they say that he took money from who? [[01:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=4203.679999999999s)]
*  That was during that during when he was interviewing RFK during our FK's here. Yeah, yeah, yeah, Bernie was taking money [[01:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=4206.639999999999s)]
*  Yeah, that's that's not yeah, that's not correct [[01:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=4212.959999999999s)]
*  He never got money from the pharmaceutical industry like from the from the big corporate lobbyist [[01:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=4215.16s)]
*  He probably got so the way this works on [[01:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=4219.36s)]
*  Open secrets is like and let me just read it [[01:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=4222.799999999999s)]
*  So just like you read it figure cited by Kennedy referred to the industry in which individual donors were employed. Yeah, okay [[01:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=4225.24s)]
*  Because Kennedy said that he of that Bernie Sanders got a certain amount of money. Yeah, and this is just a clip [[01:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=4232.56s)]
*  This is this is actually goes perfect example of what we've been talking about. Yeah, we see a clip of something, right? [[01:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=4238.0s)]
*  in [[01:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=4243.24s)]
*  2020 this was the claim senator Bernie Sanders was the single largest receiver of pharmaceutical money in Congress and [[01:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=4244.68s)]
*  The context was this figure cited by RFK jr. Referred to the industry in which individual donors were employed [[01:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=4251.72s)]
*  Yeah, did not refer to funds originating from or directed by pharmaceutical companies [[01:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=4257.24s)]
*  So what that is is the way that they the way that when you make a donation to a politician as an individual [[01:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=4261.5199999999995s)]
*  It gets filed with the FEC, right and in that filing you write what your job is, right? [[01:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=4267.919999999999s)]
*  And if you work in the pharmaceutical industry if you work for Johnson Johnson as a janitor [[01:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=4273.799999999999s)]
*  that basically gets tracked as like Johnson and Johnson in the in the [[01:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=4278.5199999999995s)]
*  section of like whichever sector you're a part of so like a [[01:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=4284.5599999999995s)]
*  Lot of nurses gave donations to Bernie Sanders. So that's like technically still lobbed under like health care and [[01:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=4289.040000000001s)]
*  It was not yeah, it was never it was never from like the executives [[01:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=4296.360000000001s)]
*  It wasn't like executives giving a million dollars like the fucking janitor works there or like, you know [[01:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=4300.64s)]
*  Like an accountant that works for this company, but it gets filed [[01:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=4304.76s)]
*  Yeah, so that it looks like that in some sort of well they just it's good to have like [[01:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=4307.280000000001s)]
*  Know what sectors are doing knowing what sectors are donating but yeah, there is room for nuance, of course there and [[01:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=4312.44s)]
*  And RFK was falsely claiming that he was getting money from like CEOs and like the industry [[01:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=4320.24s)]
*  Industry packs or whatever when that wasn't the case. It was just like random people that work for these companies, you know [[01:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=4327.78s)]
*  Yeah, I think it makes I mean it totally makes sense to me that that's the way that it could happen, you know [[01:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=4333.54s)]
*  Yeah, but it's so funny RFK probably saw a clip or it's hurt [[01:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=4337.64s)]
*  You know, it's just like it's so it's like I think RFK knows better. I don't I don't trust any of these guys [[01:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=4341.24s)]
*  I'll be honest to you like whether it's RFK Trump or any number of these people or you know Democrats as well like Kamala [[01:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=4346.5599999999995s)]
*  Harris like I think RFK definitely knows better [[01:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=4352.5599999999995s)]
*  He's just saying that because it's a good line and people will believe him. Yeah, and I mean look that's how it works [[01:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=4355.08s)]
*  I know cuz like Joe Rogan talked about it too where they were talking about like Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders getting money from like these [[01:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=4361.719999999999s)]
*  You know big pharmaceutical corporations that wasn't the case but it got a lot of mileage on that side of the internet [[01:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=4368.6s)]
*  That's the other thing that I am frustrated by where there's like no consensus on this stuff anymore [[01:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=4375.88s)]
*  Like what does a consensus mean? Like we all agree on one thing [[01:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=4380.84s)]
*  Yeah [[01:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=4383.64s)]
*  and you don't have to agree on one like not everybody has to get together and agree on the same thing but like [[01:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=4384.120000000001s)]
*  There's no there's no established truth anymore where everybody's like operating on whatever the fuck [[01:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=4389.88s)]
*  They think is the is the truth and and heavily leaning into their biases and I feel like the internet has become [[01:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=4395.12s)]
*  Way more echo chambered in that regard and it's very frustrating to see you know, there's no [[01:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=4400.96s)]
*  there's no [[01:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=4407.5599999999995s)]
*  Would you say can can consensus consensus? [[01:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=4409.8s)]
*  So there's no like regional place you can go to except now almost your own gut or if you're a influence by clips or whatever [[01:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=4412.76s)]
*  Right, but we're dumbasses. You know what I mean? Like we're fucking stupid. I'm stupid like I can't I can't [[01:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=4419.32s)]
*  Check everything like I can't even fucking keep up with you [[01:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=4425.12s)]
*  Feel you but what I'm saying is is that better than us all being under the influence of some consensus? [[01:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=4428.32s)]
*  I'm not I'm not disagreeing with you. I'm just looking at it [[01:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=4434.88s)]
*  I think it's it's good to have a healthy diet of both right like you still need to have trusted [[01:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=4437.08s)]
*  Resources that you can go to and rely on [[01:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=4443.0s)]
*  That will every now and then be like that's wrong [[01:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=4445.64s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=4448.16s)]
*  And and I try to urge people to not get their media diet exclusively for me either for that reason [[01:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=4449.12s)]
*  And even my media diet itself is incredibly diverse [[01:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=4454.86s)]
*  I probably watch more Fox News than I watch like CNN is shit partially because they're more entertaining [[01:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=4458.5s)]
*  but [[01:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=4463.38s)]
*  You know, I I look at everything [[01:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=4465.099999999999s)]
*  So that I can develop a better understanding of like what people are saying and what people are believing in general [[01:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=4467.78s)]
*  I need to do a better job of that. I think of finding my information diet [[01:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=4472.62s)]
*  You know and just where does it come from? [[01:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=4477.139999999999s)]
*  It's not I just don't get enough of it a lot of times a lot of times I operate mostly just like on my own [[01:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=4479.0199999999995s)]
*  Feelings kind of which is in the end kind of your instincts or whatever [[01:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=4483.86s)]
*  But then I start to notice that things that I get influenced by and like my own algorithm and things [[01:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=4487.9s)]
*  I was like, oh, I'm fucking getting influenced [[01:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=4492.5s)]
*  you know, I'm up last night in the middle of the night and it's like have I [[01:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=4494.0599999999995s)]
*  Reposted too many tick tocks about [[01:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=4498.9s)]
*  Gaza, you know and I'm up for 40 minutes last night laying in my bed and my brains calculating for but shit like that [[01:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=4502.42s)]
*  You know, it's like but it's just cuz I'll get to my you know, it's like none of its bad stuff really [[01:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=4508.54s)]
*  But it's um, I'll notice if I get on my Twitter thing, especially I'll get angry [[01:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=4512.46s)]
*  I get and then I'm like if I'm at least aware of this is happening people that aren't aware [[01:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=4515.9800000000005s)]
*  That aren't even thinking like oh, this is affecting me. They're just being affected. Yeah, then it's like man [[01:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=4521.86s)]
*  My my the way I see my goal like the way I see my job is to basically get people to understand [[01:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=4528.02s)]
*  Why they're angry and then get angry at the appropriate vectors like where who's actually causing harm in their immediate lives [[01:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=4533.78s)]
*  That's why I actively urge people to unionize and work to organize in their communities and organize in their in their workplaces in general [[01:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=4540.38s)]
*  So they have a network of support with like not necessarily even like-minded people but like people that have the same interest, right? [[01:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=4548.4400000000005s)]
*  You don't have to like your co-workers all that much [[01:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=4554.54s)]
*  But no matter what your boss is still fucking you over in the exact same way, right? [[01:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=4557.26s)]
*  He wants you to work the most amount of hours for the least amount of pay [[01:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=4562.22s)]
*  You want to work the least amount of hours for the most amount of pay [[01:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=4566.06s)]
*  This is a contradiction, right? [[01:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=4569.72s)]
*  So how do you resolve that the only way to to overcome the unlimited amount of? [[01:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=4571.84s)]
*  Power that your boss has over you is by getting together and being like hey, man [[01:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=4578.76s)]
*  You got to give us a better contract, right? [[01:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=4583.02s)]
*  Like those are the things that I advocate for so that people develop a better understanding of who's actually harming them and they improve their [[01:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=4585.540000000001s)]
*  improve their lives immediately in the short term and then build on that momentum [[01:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=4592.8s)]
*  With that said do you think we should have like a higher minimum wage you feel like I mean [[01:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=4599.12s)]
*  I think that's one part of this story, but it's not I've thought about it a lot. I've listened to people talk about it [[01:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=4602.94s)]
*  Yeah, I think it's good, but that's still a band-aid solution. I think like there needs to be more [[01:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=4608.28s)]
*  labor back control in general like unions and stuff. Yeah labor unions. Yeah, we have we have [[01:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=4614.24s)]
*  10% union participation rate in this country is lower than other countries that we fucked up like Chile [[01:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=4620.799999999999s)]
*  And we fucked up Chile we did a coup there we set up a dictatorship [[01:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=4627.12s)]
*  And they still are able to unionize and we yeah, and we wrote we rewrote their Constitution and they still have a higher union [[01:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=4631.28s)]
*  Participation rate than we do they have 15% in Chile. We have 10% [[01:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=4638.76s)]
*  Do you see cuz that's we had the we had the teamsters president of one of the teamsters union presidents on oh, yeah [[01:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=4642.96s)]
*  You're Sean O'Brien. Yeah, he was interesting [[01:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=4648.52s)]
*  I've interviewed him before I've like some convos on him. He has a podcast now. Oh, he does [[01:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=4651.56s)]
*  Yeah, I didn't know that I saw him at the [[01:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=4656.26s)]
*  Inauguration it's just interesting that I'd never talked to a teamsters union president [[01:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=4659.02s)]
*  I've heard of the teamsters, you know, I watched newsies or whatever like when I was a kid a bunch. Yeah [[01:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=4662.42s)]
*  But it was just interesting to see that [[01:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=4667.3s)]
*  You know to learn about unions and see how they work and then some people are like well once you get unionized [[01:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=4669.62s)]
*  It's hard to you don't have as much individuality [[01:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=4675.280000000001s)]
*  So if I'm super a hard-working I'm self-motivated then maybe I don't want to be a part of the union, you know [[01:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=4677.62s)]
*  Yeah, but I could see that as a safety net for people to have a union against corporations like [[01:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=4682.82s)]
*  Yeah to me it makes perfect sense. Like yeah, otherwise they're gonna clean out your pockets. They're gonna [[01:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=4688.9s)]
*  That's look every union every union member will tell you like the the motto for unions is united [[01:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=4694.219999999999s)]
*  We bargain divided we beg right you can either go and be like I'm such a good guy [[01:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=4700.94s)]
*  Please like look at how hard I'm working and then in the off chance [[01:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=4706.219999999999s)]
*  Maybe get recognized by your boss and maybe get a little bit extra money on the side [[01:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=4709.42s)]
*  or you can get together with your you know, you can get together and engage in the act of collective bargaining and [[01:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=4713.78s)]
*  force the company's hand into offering you better benefits and [[01:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=4720.54s)]
*  Basically claw back the profits that you're generating for them because without the workforce you got nothing, right? [[01:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=4724.54s)]
*  What do you think the fucking CEO is gonna build the table? No, you know what? [[01:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=4729.9800000000005s)]
*  I mean, you don't know the first thing about building tables, right? [[01:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=4733.18s)]
*  It's just gonna all all this gonna be is is a bunch of wood on the factory floor without you right [[01:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=4736.14s)]
*  Workers are the ones who add the value who generate the value [[01:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=4742.34s)]
*  Yeah, Bernie has a good um Bernie had a good thing about that [[01:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=4746.06s)]
*  He said that well if we're gonna shorten people's work weeks, right? [[01:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=4749.3s)]
*  He he was talking about having a shorter work week. Yeah, and then that since companies profits are going up [[01:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=4753.3s)]
*  Yeah, then the employees the amount that they should make should go up [[01:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=4758.900000000001s)]
*  It's like yeah, it shouldn't just be the company at the top that has the increase [[01:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=4762.0199999999995s)]
*  Yeah, so I mean AI is a perfect example of this right like it's very disruptive to the to the environment [[01:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=4766.259999999999s)]
*  I don't like that [[01:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=4771.94s)]
*  But more importantly also on top of that. It's it's used as a way to displace the existing labor force, right? [[01:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=4773.339999999999s)]
*  Because now you can just get the machine to do the job of the person that was doing the job beforehand [[01:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=4782.54s)]
*  I'm an advocate that like no you should still keep that person employed pay him the same amount of money make him work less [[01:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=4787.98s)]
*  Why I mean, why are you firing this person now? [[01:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=4795.58s)]
*  Because AI is a tool right right [[01:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=4798.38s)]
*  But the way that we the way that companies work under capitalism is whenever there's a technological advancement like this, right? [[01:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=4800.82s)]
*  This has allowed us to be on 24-7 now [[01:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=4807.66s)]
*  You can have so much more output as a worker, right? [[01:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=4810.8s)]
*  You can be you can you can be online at all times productivity rises in that process [[01:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=4813.38s)]
*  Your boss can get a hold of you at all. Yeah, boss can get a hold of you at all times [[01:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=4818.900000000001s)]
*  you're more tapped in you're more you're more aware of what's going on in the world and [[01:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=4822.7s)]
*  And and you can be a better worker because of that but in that process bosses look at that and go, okay [[01:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=4828.900000000001s)]
*  Now I can make one guy do the work of five [[01:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=4834.06s)]
*  I'm gonna fire four fucking people and I'm gonna make the one guy do the work of the other four people and [[01:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=4836.26s)]
*  That is how [[01:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=4843.38s)]
*  That is under capitalism [[01:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=4845.38s)]
*  that's how it works where they use technological advancements that increase productivity to displace the existing labor force to just basically fire them and [[01:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=4847.06s)]
*  instead of lowering the hours that the existing workforce worked and maybe even increasing their pay in the process because they're still doing the same work [[01:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=4856.86s)]
*  You know what I mean? And because they're fucking human beings like that's why I'm actually at a certain point [[01:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=4863.82s)]
*  It has to tip towards a actual revolution where people pick up [[01:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=4868.7s)]
*  And I don't know if we can say this or not [[01:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=4873.42s)]
*  But I'm I mean I say it all the time people call me radical for that really I'm a big revolution guy [[01:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=4875.06s)]
*  I've always had little dreams of like more semi revolutions or like regional or whatever at least I hope at least I can make it [[01:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=4880.06s)]
*  To the regional revolution like I understand if I don't make it to the national [[01:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=4885.9400000000005s)]
*  but I want to be on a horseback or at least on a fucking standing next to a [[01:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=4889.26s)]
*  counter one of the [[01:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=4893.06s)]
*  one of our [[01:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=4894.3s)]
*  like [[01:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=4895.62s)]
*  bosses or whatever like I want to what why see that's because that is no fucking [[01:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=4896.82s)]
*  I know but think about the way you presented that you want to count or a boss to be the leader of the revolution [[01:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=4902.54s)]
*  Somebody you have to have some sort of I agree, but it should be people back revolution. That's what we have people [[01:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=4908.38s)]
*  But one of us gets mildly elected or something but not a boss or a fucking politician those guys or a count is gonna be [[01:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=4914.14s)]
*  It's gonna be an organizer an activist someone with a someone with a background [[01:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=4920.7s)]
*  Someone who understands the needs of the people it's gonna be somebody also who works at a Renaissance Fair [[01:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=4926.3s)]
*  full-time who can be on a horseback who can handle the type of [[01:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=4931.5s)]
*  You think about I'm not even joking us on it's kind of crazy [[01:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=4934.82s)]
*  But you will need a month to do is fucking I mean I am willing to ride through here with a spear [[01:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=4937.66s)]
*  But yeah, I at a certain point if you let so many people go [[01:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=4943.06s)]
*  Just to appease a company to appease corporations. You're just gonna have more those people have to at some point [[01:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=4948.02s)]
*  There has to be a revolution in that how revolutions happen. Yeah, I mean when conditions [[01:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=4953.7s)]
*  Worsen to a certain degree yeah people go alright enough is enough [[01:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=4958.46s)]
*  We're backed into a corner and they start recognizing that like they're being fucked over [[01:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=4962.3s)]
*  But that can also lead to a dangerous path where you know about that [[01:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=4966.9800000000005s)]
*  Well the dangerous part about that is like if they're if the people are not steered in the right direction [[01:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=4971.34s)]
*  To recognize who's actually doing the harm to them they can be diluted by misinformation and think it's the Jews or think it's [[01:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=4976.3s)]
*  fucking [[01:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=4985.34s)]
*  Or yeah, I think it's a Adam Schiff [[01:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=4987.0599999999995s)]
*  Who's apparently having sex with dead children in their minds or think it's like the Guatemalan immigrant? [[01:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=4989.98s)]
*  You know what I mean that motherfucker is not controlling your life [[01:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=4995.9s)]
*  He is worse off than you and he has the exact same interest as you just wants to put food in his belly and [[01:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=4999.339999999999s)]
*  Have a roof over his head [[01:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=5005.54s)]
*  Mons that came over the border and stuff yeah, yeah [[01:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=5008.339999999999s)]
*  That's what I mean like a Guatemalan immigrant or a Honduran immigrant is not like he's not dominating your life at all [[01:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=5010.299999999999s)]
*  They're not here to do evil. They're not here to do bad. They're here to just like work [[01:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=5016.14s)]
*  They're fucking pick strawberries all goddamn day so our asses can eat those strawberries cheap as hell [[01:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=5020.22s)]
*  You know what I mean, and then we turn around and we're like yeah, they're all rapists drug dealer murderers [[01:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=5024.820000000001s)]
*  We got a fucking purge the country of these people and it's like is really fucked up [[01:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=5029.3s)]
*  How would you um how do you successfully do something like that then because I think a lot of people's concern [[01:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=5034.46s)]
*  I think here's what happens is you're like I'm not safe anymore, right and [[01:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=5040.740000000001s)]
*  You start to feel [[01:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=5044.74s)]
*  Right there's people that get that that were raped or killed there was a couple instances where they that they put them on the news [[01:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=5046.46s)]
*  Right there on the congressional [[01:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=5052.66s)]
*  You know they had some of the Trump had him Trump had him at the at the victims at the congressional joint congressional hearing right [[01:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=5054.06s)]
*  So I think you hear about those things and you're like well [[01:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=5059.900000000001s)]
*  Yeah, you start to what you'll start to apply them to everyone [[01:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=5063.22s)]
*  I think she's crazy think about that we say there's 20 million undocumented migrants in this country [[01:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=5066.62s)]
*  They come from every part of the [[01:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=5071.34s)]
*  And to think that they're all one collective hive mind that's here to do like evil rapes and shit is psychotic [[01:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=5075.14s)]
*  I'm like, bro, like they don't even speak each other's language. Like what are you talking about? [[01:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=5080.46s)]
*  like they have no unified hive mind here, but you you [[01:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=5084.62s)]
*  Basically learn to think that way you learn to hate in that regard [[01:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=5088.62s)]
*  And I think the media plays a big role in this like right-wing media specifically is it hate though [[01:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=5091.860000000001s)]
*  You think cuz it's like I just fear [[01:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=5097.06s)]
*  Okay, so I cuz to me it's like have a fucking organized system if I go to a dude [[01:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=5099.34s)]
*  I go to I went to Canada a couple days ago. It was heck. It was heck getting in out of there [[01:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=5105.740000000001s)]
*  It's heck getting out of there. It's super organized [[01:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=5110.820000000001s)]
*  You know, it's like but we should it just because here's the thing if you don't know who's in your country [[01:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=5113.34s)]
*  Then you can't do a correct census. You can't allocate things correctly to people [[01:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=5118.3s)]
*  You can't know who needs what in certain areas [[01:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=5122.5s)]
*  That's why they also factor on not coming to migrants into the census as well [[01:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=5125.14s)]
*  But if they're fearful of the federal government if they're fearful of the federal government, they're not gonna open the door for a census guy [[01:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=5128.76s)]
*  That's part of the reason why sanctuary cities began to begin with it was actually advocated for this is something that this is old lore [[01:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=5134.68s)]
*  People don't even know this at this point because everybody thinks like all sanctuary cities is woke libtard bullshit, bro [[01:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=5141.400000000001s)]
*  It was the fucking cops and the FBI that was advocating for sanctuary cities [[01:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=5147.08s)]
*  Why because whenever a murder or some kind of like violence happened in an undocumented neighborhood [[01:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=5150.64s)]
*  Cops would come in and nobody would talk to them. So they were like [[01:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=5158.160000000001s)]
*  Here that's important. I never knew sanctuary cities initially were proposed by law enforcement because [[01:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=5163.280000000001s)]
*  They realized that whenever there was violence or like, you know drug dealing or a murder that took place in an area where the witnesses were [[01:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=5170.04s)]
*  Undocumented migrants they wouldn't talk to the cops because they were fearful that if they talked to the cops they were gonna get fucking deported [[01:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=5177.68s)]
*  So in order to open up more collaboration and actually solve crimes like rape murder and all these other like violent crimes [[01:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=5184.0s)]
*  They were like we have to tell every undocumented market like we're not gonna arrest you [[01:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=5191.4s)]
*  We're not gonna collaborate with ice or INS at the time before ice existed [[01:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=5195.88s)]
*  We are we're just here to serve you as public servants [[01:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=5202.08s)]
*  And that was the reason why it was law enforcement that initially suggested sanctuary cities. It wasn't like woke activists or whatever [[01:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=5205.4s)]
*  And it's so interesting that like now Republicans say it used that as a catch-all term to be like, oh [[01:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=5212.42s)]
*  You're letting criminals go basically. That's what they that's what they make it seem like that's what they imply [[01:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=5218.38s)]
*  Bring that up. How did sanctuary cities get started? That's fascinating man. Yeah sanctuary city policies were not originally proposed by law enforcement [[01:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=5223.54s)]
*  But they were they've come to support them for public safety reasons, right in the 1980s when church in the United States provided refuge for individuals escaping [[01:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=5231.54s)]
*  Civil unrest in El Salvador sanctuary city specifically emerged from protests against federal immigration policies that denied asylum the refugees [[01:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=5239.18s)]
*  However, many law enforcement officials including police chiefs have advocated for sanctuary policies [[01:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=5245.42s)]
*  They argue it did they argue that these policies help build trust between immigrant communities and local law enforcement [[01:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=5249.56s)]
*  This trust is crucial for encouraging immigrants to report crimes and cooperate with police investigations [[01:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=5254.740000000001s)]
*  Sanctuary policies allow police to focus on local priorities and prevent crimes. Wow, that's interesting man. I wonder though. What's that? I'm sorry [[01:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=5259.400000000001s)]
*  Was the AI search engine or some shit? What is this? Yeah, this is perplexity, but they have all the sites [[01:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=5267.3s)]
*  Sources cited. All right. I think it's interesting then though. I wonder how many cities then [[01:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=5272.9400000000005s)]
*  jumped on it as a on even on the Democratic side to say like [[01:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=5279.3s)]
*  Or left side whatever you want to call it [[01:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=5283.58s)]
*  But like to say oh I better be a part of this now if I want my voters to then vote for me [[01:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=5285.66s)]
*  I'm saying like so sometimes like it the political kickball kickball gets created one way [[01:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=5290.22s)]
*  But it also gets used in a field in another way [[01:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=5294.62s)]
*  Like I because I'm I'm a I'm a active amnesty advocate like I think if [[01:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=5298.9s)]
*  First of all, this is a civil offense crossing crossing the border is a civil offense, right? [[01:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=5306.14s)]
*  Right, and you have a five-year period where if you haven't done any crimes like the statute of limitation is over now [[01:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=5311.34s)]
*  There's different legal [[01:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=5317.22s)]
*  There are different legal interpretations of this and people go back and forth on it [[01:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=5319.34s)]
*  But like the way I think about it is like if a dude is in here and they're working [[01:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=5323.18s)]
*  Right, and they're not trying to do a you know, they're not here to do evil shit [[01:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=5327.860000000001s)]
*  They're here to just simply work give him fucking give him documentation [[01:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=5332.22s)]
*  Well, the difference between an undocumented migrant and a documented one is just a piece of paper is paperwork [[01:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=5336.320000000001s)]
*  Process these people and allow them to contribute to our coffers [[01:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=5342.18s)]
*  In in more meaningful ways because they already pay taxes, but they could be paying more taxes as well [[01:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=5346.38s)]
*  If they're undocumented, yeah [[01:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=5352.14s)]
*  Cuz they they they still they I think they still pay into social security as they have to get a social security number [[01:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=5353.860000000001s)]
*  Some sort of social security number they pay for sales taxes things of that nature [[01:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=5359.24s)]
*  you know what I mean, like there's there's a bunch of different contributions they make and they can't take advantage of any of the [[01:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=5362.9400000000005s)]
*  the [[01:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=5370.34s)]
*  Government programs anyway, that's why a lot of Republicans lie [[01:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=5371.46s)]
*  They'll be like, oh undocumented migrants are like stealing our you know, our social safety nets and I'm over like I'm over here [[01:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=5374.54s)]
*  What social safety is do we have? What are they we don't have health care? [[01:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=5380.78s)]
*  Like what are they are they taking advantage of health care that we don't have they don't have health care [[01:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=5384.88s)]
*  the thing is [[01:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=5390.18s)]
*  They will Republicans will [[01:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=5392.66s)]
*  Literally factor in their natural-born US citizen children into the equation to be like see they're sending their children to public schools [[01:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=5395.46s)]
*  It's like bro. That's an American citizen, right? The child is an American citizen [[01:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=5403.06s)]
*  Yeah, yeah one in 15 households in this country is a mixed status household one in 15. Oh, yeah [[01:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=5407.06s)]
*  You can't even I mean you fucking [[01:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=5413.22s)]
*  Everybody's mixed now. It feels like mixed status like as in one parent is [[01:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=5416.38s)]
*  Undocumented like a non-citizen. Oh, yeah. Yeah, so it's probably Mexican a lot of times [[01:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=5421.740000000001s)]
*  I would bet and that's just even my Mexican friends are always like, you know, my uncle's in the back or whatever [[01:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=5426.3s)]
*  They'll say, you know, and I don't say anything but it's like I you know, I think it's interesting [[01:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=5431.42s)]
*  Like what things get? [[01:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=5436.26s)]
*  How things get framed right by the media how things get used how things like even programs like sanctuary city [[01:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=5438.660000000001s)]
*  How does it then get manipulated? [[01:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=5446.04s)]
*  and used as like a negative thing or as a thing where [[01:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=5448.54s)]
*  One party feels like well, I better declare is this or I'm gonna be out of the money. Whatever. The next thing is like [[01:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=5452.46s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, there's definitely an incentive structure among politicians to advocate for certain things [[01:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=5458.14s)]
*  But ultimately I don't really care what the incentive structure is if the if the legislation is good if it's a good thing if [[01:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=5463.54s)]
*  Trump were to do a good thing. I would advocate for it as well. You know what I mean? [[01:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=5470.780000000001s)]
*  Do you think that's true? [[01:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=5474.46s)]
*  Cuz it seems like I have in the past when Trump when Trump last time he was president [[01:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=5475.5s)]
*  When he basically said I'm gonna back away from this North Korea, South Korea shit [[01:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=5480.26s)]
*  And I'm gonna let you guys handle it on your own and in the process [[01:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=5484.4800000000005s)]
*  Actually reduced the the military campaigns that were taking place around the Korean Peninsula [[01:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=5487.86s)]
*  To to allow these two countries to talk to one another. It's one country technically that we fucking cut in half [[01:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=5494.58s)]
*  But that's a long history lesson. I'm not gonna get into North Korea South Korea. Yeah, and [[01:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=5500.54s)]
*  And that was objectively good thing like I said it at the time I was like and Rachel Maddow was very mad [[01:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=5506.26s)]
*  He was like, oh you're doing this because you love Vladimir Putin or whatever the fuck but like no that was not a bad thing [[01:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=5511.18s)]
*  Like [[01:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=5516.580000000001s)]
*  Let these guys hash it out and and let them let them rebuild their nation, you know, why the fuck are we? [[01:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=5517.660000000001s)]
*  Like why do we have you know 80,000 to 100,000 troops stationed all the time, you know, yeah [[01:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=5523.5s)]
*  I mean [[01:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=5529.660000000001s)]
*  Yeah, it feels alarming. It feels like you have to have this military thing. I think [[01:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=5532.1s)]
*  one thing that I noticed last night was like [[01:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=5537.1s)]
*  The military has had a tough time getting recruits, right? Yeah recruits recruitment has been down [[01:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=5540.22s)]
*  yeah, and so part of me always wonders will like or [[01:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=5546.06s)]
*  The did the powers it be then want the Republicans to be in office because they know that [[01:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=5550.38s)]
*  Eventually if people are believing more in their country again, it will incite more recruitments [[01:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=5556.22s)]
*  I'm not saying that that's the truth, but you just start to wonder what is the fuck is really [[01:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=5561.3s)]
*  So you will tell you what made recruitment numbers does that make sense to you though? [[01:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=5566.14s)]
*  I mean, I know where you're coming from but what made recruitment numbers explode initially was 9-eleven. That's it [[01:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=5569.700000000001s)]
*  people joined after 9-eleven and after 20 years of just like going out there and and [[01:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=5575.42s)]
*  guarding [[01:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=5582.22s)]
*  Guarding like poppy fields and getting your dick blown off by some fucking dude [[01:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=5583.66s)]
*  Who's hated you because you invaded his country when he was like 14 and probably killed his cousin [[01:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=5588.06s)]
*  You know after 20 years of doing that everyone was like, oh this shit sucks [[01:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=5593.66s)]
*  We kind of lost it here, huh? [[01:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=5598.38s)]
*  Like we did a Vietnam in Afghanistan and we had to pull out so and that was a good thing objectively [[01:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=5600.3s)]
*  I think it's good that we pulled out of Afghanistan, but [[01:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=5605.62s)]
*  I think that's the real reason why people are like what the fuck would I join the military? [[01:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=5608.62s)]
*  I can't even get a fucking charger anymore [[01:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=5612.66s)]
*  You know they they start charge the Dodge Chargers or was it was it the Camaro were they giving those out? [[01:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=5614.820000000001s)]
*  But they were that's the is the common military car. Oh, that's true [[01:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=5619.5s)]
*  You sign off on one of those the worst loan of all time. Oh, yeah, dude [[01:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=5623.74s)]
*  And then your your high school sweetheart is fucking the neighbor while you're out there sometimes mean yeah, well you're out there [[01:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=5629.66s)]
*  Jerking off in a fucking bunker and [[01:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=5637.34s)]
*  Jerking off on you or whatever and you guys are changing each other's names after 8 p.m. Or whatever and shit [[01:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=5639.9800000000005s)]
*  I think shit gets pretty melodic out there. That's what I mean [[01:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=5645.14s)]
*  You're like, why the fuck are you doing that? And then you come back and the the American government's like, alright [[01:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=5647.9400000000005s)]

*  Or a lot of people will also go into the military learn some patterns that help them to achieve [[01:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=5686.820000000001s)]
*  Well, my buddy Josh was in for a while [[01:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=5692.3s)]

*  The American military is a jobs program. That's what it is [[01:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=5776.62s)]
*  It's the I think it's the second largest hiring body in the country after Walmart if I'm not mistaken [[01:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=5780.26s)]
*  it might be the largest and [[01:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=5786.66s)]
*  I think instead of making those guys, you know making these corn fed boys from Arkansas go out and [[01:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=5788.7s)]
*  You know force them to eat MREs all goddamn day and and be constipated for a fucking week [[01:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=5797.14s)]
*  Make them build shit, you know, make them build shit in America is a jobs program. Who cares? [[01:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=5804.1s)]
*  Make the output be good rather than bad [[01:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=5809.7s)]
*  That is what my argument is the world's biggest employers Ministry of Defense US Department of the idea [[01:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=5812.74s)]
*  The Indian Ministry of Defense is the largest and then the world's second largest employer [[01:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=5818.64s)]
*  I guess the US Department of Defense is bigger than Walmart Walmart and Amazon. That's a great point [[01:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=5822.54s)]
*  I think and maybe and you know, I wish I knew more of what some of those groups did a lot of times [[01:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=5827.12s)]
*  With the military. Yeah, but I agree with you. It's like I agree the fact that why are [[01:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=5833.46s)]
*  Why does the voter what is the gun carrier the water carrier? [[01:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=5839.58s)]
*  Oh, you're always at this it's a caste system really in a lot of ways you're it is [[01:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=5843.78s)]
*  Those are the people having to do the bidding of these [[01:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=5848.36s)]
*  Elites, you know of these countries and stuff like that, but then at a certain point it's like do I decide this is my what? [[01:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=5851.719999999999s)]
*  What what integrity or what do I want to have inside of myself when I'm doing that? [[01:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=5858.04s)]
*  I could be all day like fuck [[01:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=5862.08s)]
*  I don't want to be doing this this country's a piece of shit or whatever or I can have pride in [[01:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=5863.719999999999s)]
*  what I'm doing no matter what in the spot that I'm existing in in [[01:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=5868.639999999999s)]
*  This sort of strata right and and I stand up for my country and it's just you know as we get more information [[01:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=5874.12s)]
*  It's just it's fascinating how things change. I just want like I or how things you learn. I don't hate people [[01:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=5879.72s)]
*  I just want them to to have better lives [[01:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=5886.599999999999s)]
*  You know what? [[01:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=5889.32s)]
*  I mean even people that I disagree with vehemently like I always stress this point where I say Medicare for all means for everybody [[01:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=5889.92s)]
*  Right, even if you're a fucking Nazi, you're gonna get health care. Even if you don't want health care [[01:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=5896.18s)]
*  I'm gonna fucking give you the health care. Give a shit. Okay, you can cry about it all day every day [[01:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=5900.48s)]
*  it's just and I think that's the attitude that other people are supposed to have in this process to like there's got to be a [[01:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=5904.879999999999s)]
*  universality to these proposals because like I [[01:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=5911.0s)]
*  Think we got to do right by others and we are not doing that right now [[01:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=5914.44s)]
*  The American government is not doing that and every at every step of the process [[01:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=5917.919999999999s)]
*  And that's why the the military is a great example of this, you know, we're just using and abusing these dudes and [[01:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=5922.36s)]
*  Making them do a whole lot of awful shit overseas so that some rich asshole can make more money [[01:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=5928.76s)]
*  You know, yeah, and then they're broken in that process. They come back [[01:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=5935.62s)]
*  There's no there's no way of like repairing them and we basically lie to them too. We're like, oh, yeah [[01:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=5939.58s)]
*  You'll get a you'll get a great job. You'll go to college [[01:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=5944.56s)]
*  You'll be able to uplift yourself and it's like that should be available without you having to serve in the military [[01:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=5947.1s)]
*  Yeah, but if that was available if free college existed if free health care existed and go to the military no fucking buddy is [[01:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=5953.48s)]
*  Going to the military. Why the fuck would you do that? [[01:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=5960.959999999999s)]
*  I'm sure some real gunners less. He has some cool call of duty for dance modern warfare [[01:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=5963.719999999999s)]
*  Okay, but I mean, yeah those guys are but I'm saying you would still have some yeah you would but but I agree [[01:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=5969.04s)]
*  It wouldn't be this significantly lower. It wouldn't be this [[01:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=5974.74s)]
*  System that gets kind of manipulated and used [[01:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=5978.16s)]
*  That's why they don't want to fix it though, that's why I don't want to give free health care [[01:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=5981.320000000001s)]
*  But that's why there's they don't want to fix so many things like yeah [[01:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=5984.360000000001s)]
*  And that's what I'm saying [[01:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=5986.76s)]
*  We learn more as we learn more about it you start to see some of the clarity or some of you learn more [[01:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=5987.8s)]
*  You have more information [[01:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=5993.580000000001s)]
*  But then how do I operate still when I have that more information like do what you know? [[01:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=5994.56s)]
*  It's tough because if I become a nihilist or you know, so then I'm miserable my my day-to-day is miserable, you know [[01:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=5998.860000000001s)]
*  And I'm not [[01:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=6006.900000000001s)]
*  Disagreeing with you. I'm just saying it's how do we manage in those spaces as we learn more? [[01:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=6007.96s)]
*  I'm fairly tapped into all of the the shortcomings of the American government and yet I enjoy myself [[01:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=6014.24s)]
*  I mean I still I still jerk off before I go to sleep. I still watch anime. I play basketball [[01:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=6021.24s)]
*  I focus on myself [[01:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=6026.72s)]
*  I think like there are certain things that you have control over and that is your own body, right? [[01:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=6028.16s)]
*  you're your immediate friends in your family and [[01:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=6034.2s)]
*  You should actively work on those things to [[01:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=6037.04s)]
*  To basically not lose sight of your own humanity because it's easy to get lost in the sauce [[01:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=6041.12s)]
*  In the everyday cruelty that you that you recognize is happening all around and it makes you go crazy [[01:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=6048.08s)]
*  And in order to combat that I always urge people to engage in self-improvement [[01:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=6054.16s)]
*  Set goals for yourself and try to achieve them [[01:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=6058.959999999999s)]
*  That's at least how I've always managed this stuff and also being around other people who aren't immediately [[01:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=6061.48s)]
*  Agreeing to you your your worldview like I I love parks for that reason. I love third-rate cases [[01:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=6068.44s)]
*  No, not like parks and recreation is in like the TV show. I mean like literal public parks. Oh, yeah, dude [[01:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=6074.959999999999s)]
*  Yeah, there's a fucking there's a band or not a band [[01:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=6080.28s)]
*  There's some homeless guys stole I guess a band's high school equipment during kovat over by the there's a park behind my apartment and [[01:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=6082.94s)]
*  You could hear them sometimes practicing in the like 3 or 4 a.m [[01:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=6090.48s)]
*  They get some they get a couple dudes tuned up in a tent or whatever and you could hear them [[01:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=6094.04s)]
*  What song were they playing for a while? Oh? [[01:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=6099.0s)]
*  Love the way you lie [[01:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=6105.12s)]
*  I don't know what instruments they had but there's pretty cool. You know, they got a whole sheet music and everything, you know [[01:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=6110.2s)]
*  But it's like yeah, just making the most of where you're at [[01:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=6114.759999999999s)]
*  And also our military is there like you it keeps us safe if there's flooding if they do a ton of stuff [[01:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=6118.08s)]
*  Yeah, the Army Corps engineers like I interviewed a guy [[01:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=6123.92s)]
*  I don't want people to feel like their lives are in vain [[01:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=6126.18s)]
*  No, no, I admire people that go and are willing to put their years of lives [[01:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=6129.28s)]
*  It's firing those guys too [[01:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=6133.28s)]
*  By the way right now like the Army Corps engineers is like what you just described when there's a flooding happening like they build the levies [[01:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=6135.0s)]
*  They build the bridges right Trump literally is firing those people too is crazy [[01:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=6140.96s)]
*  Why is he doing it is he because he hates the Army Corps engineers no because he doesn't give a shit [[01:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=6145.4s)]
*  That's my point. He doesn't care. He's like yeah go Elon do whatever you need to do fire these probationary employees [[01:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=6149.5599999999995s)]
*  Nobody knows what probationary means so they think like oh, you know, it's good. It's good that we're like downsizing a little bit [[01:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=6156.16s)]
*  It's like no dude. You're gonna start slowly, but surely five years down the line [[01:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=6162.4s)]
*  Notice it you're gonna start noticing that things are just not working [[01:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=6167.599999999999s)]
*  Yeah, like air traffic controls a great example of this since the Reagan era [[01:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=6170.8s)]
*  Like the numbers of air traffic controls [[01:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=6175.32s)]
*  Controllers even though air traffic has increased the number of air traffic controllers have not kept up with the increase of air traffic [[01:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=6178.5599999999995s)]
*  So you got towers where there's like one dude [[01:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=6186.5599999999995s)]
*  There's got to be like 30 dudes in that tower. I don't want the fucking plane [[01:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=6190.64s)]
*  I don't want planes to crash, you know what I mean? [[01:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=6194.16s)]
*  Probably more of them have started to work in if that's true. Is there less FAA people? [[01:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=6196.44s)]
*  No, there's probably more FAA people especially with like TSA and whatnot [[01:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=6201.76s)]
*  But I'm saying that it hasn't matched up to the rate of air [[01:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=6206.4800000000005s)]
*  Like there's more planes in the sky is what I'm saying when there's more planes in the sky [[01:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=6211.400000000001s)]
*  You need more air traffic controls or cut the FA helps support an air safety [[01:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=6215.72s)]
*  President Donald Trump's administration has said no one at the federal FAA with a critical safety position has been fired as it cuts the federal [[01:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=6221.6s)]
*  Workforce some FAA jobs were eliminated had direct roles in supporting safety inspectors and airport operations [[01:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=6228.36s)]
*  according to their union and former former [[01:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=6233.599999999999s)]
*  This is another way that they lie by the way and and Karen Bass did this with the LA wildfires [[01:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=6235.96s)]
*  Where she was like, oh we didn't actually cut the LA FD budget. They did they cut the support budget [[01:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=6241.12s)]
*  But when you cut the support budget, yeah, sure. You're not cutting the actual firefighters, right? [[01:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=6246.799999999999s)]
*  But you're not reducing their numbers [[01:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=6251.36s)]
*  But when you cut the support staff budget you're cutting mechanics when you cut the mechanics and you're fucking firing [[01:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=6252.759999999999s)]
*  Engine is busted you send it over and it just sits in a goddamn yard for months because now there's no fucking mechanics to fix [[01:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=6258.36s)]
*  The goddamn car. Yeah, so all of a sudden you're down one fire engine. It's all it all works together [[01:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=6265.679999999999s)]
*  I'm curious to see cuz Trump's making you know, and there's so many like [[01:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=6271.32s)]
*  Executive orders and things right out of the gate and there's so much focus on him by the media, too [[01:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=6276.12s)]
*  But I'm curious to see if some of these things turn out [[01:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=6280.32s)]
*  To help long term, you know, no way I'm hopeful that they are [[01:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=6284.32s)]
*  Do you like I'm hopeful that you know if they're gonna cut Medicare or Medicaid that it's also because they have the [[01:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=6288.639999999999s)]
*  They're gonna make price transparency from hospitals, right? [[01:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=6295.4s)]
*  And and so then there won't be the expenses won't be as high right? [[01:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=6298.679999999999s)]
*  Like I'm hoping that there's some long-term strategy to a lot of his ideas like the same thing with them [[01:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=6303.2s)]
*  Goss and Israel. I don't know if there is it seems I don't like it, but I'm sure Trump is a major Israel dick rider [[01:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=6309.48s)]

*  Want things to get better and I hope it does but the reason why I say I'm certain that it won't is because like [[01:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=6328.22s)]
*  What you just mentioned right 800 billion 800 billion dollars of Medicare Medicaid that I want to cut Mike Johnson goes on stage says I [[01:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=6334.38s)]

*  There's not fraud happening in Medicare and Medicaid on the point of the recipient, right? [[01:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=6346.34s)]
*  It's happening on the point of the providers, right? And that's why I got banned recently on which yesterday [[01:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=6350.62s)]

*  They they misconstrued it as though it was a call to action to assassinate a sitting US senator because I said [[01:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=6363.82s)]
*  To Mike Johnson because I was listening to him back and forth [[01:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=6370.82s)]
*  I said like if Mike Johnson actually cared about Medicare fraud [[01:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=6373.98s)]
*  He would tackle Medicare fraud happening at the point of the providers [[01:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=6378.46s)]
*  But he's obvious that he doesn't care about Medicare fraud because if he did care about Medicare fraud, he would break Scott [[01:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=6382.259999999999s)]
*  Who is responsible for the? [[01:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=6389.259999999999s)]
*  historic [[01:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=6392.98s)]
*  1.7 billion dollars worth of Medicare fraud and as he still work in the row he's he he was a [[01:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=6395.179999999999s)]
*  He was a corporate executive at HCA at the time in the 90s. The DOJ came after him [[01:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=6402.5s)]
*  And and he basically quit his job [[01:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=6409.099999999999s)]
*  He got a ten million dollar compensation package after doing 1.7 billion dollars in the private [[01:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=6412.219999999999s)]
*  I'm then came and worked in the private sector [[01:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=6417.9s)]
*  He got three hundred million dollars in stock options didn't see a fucking moment of jail time for that [[01:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=6420.0199999999995s)]
*  Okay [[01:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=6425.66s)]
*  And then now and then he became Florida governor and now he's a fucking Florida senator and he's a prominent figure in the Republican Party [[01:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=6426.179999999999s)]
*  I think he was like their head of their fundraising or some shit. I forget what is a [[01:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=6432.94s)]
*  Position in the Trump campaign and the Republican Party is beyond the fact that he's a senator. I [[01:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=6436.5s)]
*  Don't know if they should allow people to go from one to the other [[01:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=6442.42s)]
*  From [[01:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=6445.219999999999s)]
*  Private to public, you know I'm saying like yeah, I just cuz it just be obviously there's conflicts of interest when people do that sort [[01:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=6446.5s)]
*  Of thing, you know, oh for sure. I mean, that's one aspect, but I agree with you. I agree. It's like [[01:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=6452.86s)]
*  That guy should be in jail. Like that's what I think [[01:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=6458.219999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I think if you do 1.7 billion dollars in Medicare fraud, you should be in fucking jail [[01:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=6460.58s)]
*  Like what are we talking about? I shouldn't be a Republican senator from Florida. Yeah, it says [[01:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=6465.5599999999995s)]
*  Right here Rick Scott's role in the Columbia HCA scandal in 2003 Rick Scott's company Columbia HCA [[01:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=6471.72s)]
*  The largest private hospital chain in the US was found guilty of defrauding Medicare [[01:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=6477.04s)]
*  The company was forced to pay 1.7 billion a settlement [[01:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=6481.400000000001s)]
*  That was the largest medical fraud fine in US history at the time [[01:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=6484.54s)]
*  Scott who was the CEO left the company with a $10 million severance package after this 300 million stock options to Wow [[01:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=6488.54s)]
*  So do you start to wonder so this was when he was in the private sector, right? [[01:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=6494.96s)]
*  Yeah, so it's yeah, what's gonna be different if a guy comes over from that private sector to the public sector should it's this like [[01:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=6498.219999999999s)]
*  The richest congressperson by the way, is he really? Yeah [[01:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=6505.179999999999s)]
*  Give us some fucking money. I think people should only be able to have a certain amount of money. Um [[01:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=6508.78s)]
*  Yeah, I mean look I don't I don't necessarily care about how much money people have [[01:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=6513.78s)]
*  I care about how they make their money [[01:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=6517.78s)]
*  But no, I agree. How does this guy how do you keep like this LeBron James, right? [[01:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=6520.139999999999s)]
*  50,000 points he crossed over that boundary 20 plus years of dominance in the league [[01:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=6525.18s)]
*  He gets paid a wage. He's a what is known as a one of the few people is like a like a wage billionaire, basically [[01:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=6531.98s)]
*  If he makes that kind of money that means he's making somebody else a fuckton more money, right and [[01:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=6540.3s)]
*  I don't mind that he's getting paid these big bucks [[01:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=6546.5s)]
*  Partially because he's my goat and I love him. Okay, I think he deserves it but also partially because [[01:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=6550.6s)]
*  He's not making that by like hiring people and then forcing them to work to the bone. He does have businesses [[01:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=6556.72s)]
*  He's also obviously an owner of capital as well. So he does [[01:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=6563.76s)]
*  capital accumulation as well [[01:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=6568.08s)]
*  but ultimately I just want people to be comfortable and [[01:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=6570.08s)]
*  I think that if you are working a job [[01:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=6573.76s)]
*  Like you should be able to have a house you should be able to live comfortably [[01:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=6577.84s)]
*  Yeah, and it doesn't matter what job it is. You could be picking up trash. I think that's still obviously valuable. It's worthwhile also, I guess [[01:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=6582.44s)]
*  Sanitation is one of the worst examples because they do have pretty solid unions. Yeah, we had a garbage man on it [[01:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=6591.44s)]
*  It's awesome, man. My buddy Wayne. He's got a podcast now called trash talk, but um [[01:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=6596.24s)]

*  He has to be at work again in the morning. So that part I that's what I'm saying that part [[01:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=6610.28s)]
*  I don't agree with like but I'm saying if he was just making you know [[01:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=6614.24s)]
*  All of his money from just ballin and he's getting a wage like who cares, you know, I don't have an issue with that [[01:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=6617.34s)]
*  especially if the if the hold on I got open my door, sorry, I [[01:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=6622.8s)]

*  not the the [[01:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=6872.9400000000005s)]
*  perfect solution to any of these issues and [[01:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=6874.42s)]
*  I would talk to Trump. I just don't think he would come on my stream like [[01:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=6877.86s)]
*  Because he is at the end of the day [[01:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=6883.42s)]
*  He wants to go on a he wants to go on a show where they're not gonna like, you know [[01:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=6886.339999999999s)]
*  Push back too much, right? He wants to come across as like [[01:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=6890.099999999999s)]
*  he wants to be humanized and he wants to come across as like a personal a [[01:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=6894.219999999999s)]
*  Personality that is is not devoid of charisma and he's very telegenic. I it was actually my turning point when I [[01:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=6898.98s)]
*  Listened to him and you talk about cocaine when you were talking about doing coke and he was like genuinely expressing interest in it [[01:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=6906.5s)]
*  I was like, oh fuck this motherfuckers gonna win dude [[01:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=6913.94s)]
*  This podcast shit is working so good because first he did the Aidan Ross thing and that was like a bit of a dud [[01:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=6917.0599999999995s)]
*  yeah, cuz like cuz that just like didn't work out at all cuz [[01:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=6922.139999999999s)]
*  It wasn't like a normal conversation. Well, it didn't feel kind of planned [[01:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=6927.42s)]
*  Yeah, like they wanted to do like a video like something like let's do some social video [[01:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=6930.94s)]
*  I was like, I don't want to do something like yeah [[01:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=6934.54s)]
*  Like the whole dancing and stuff in front of the cyber truck [[01:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=6935.98s)]
*  Like that stuff it didn't work at all [[01:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=6940.1s)]
*  But then I saw your podcast and I was like, oh my god this motherfucker [[01:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=6942.3s)]
*  This motherfucker is gonna win the the goddamn presidency, but he didn't come I mean they didn't ask for any yet [[01:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=6945.82s)]
*  They didn't ask for any edits, you know, that was a thing [[01:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=6950.7s)]
*  They didn't say like we need to see this they didn't fucking have you guys have a good day [[01:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=6952.7s)]
*  Yeah, but that's also because like you're not but I'm also not a political guy. Like yeah, this is a trap [[01:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=6956.38s)]
*  I fell into recently cuz you cuz you talked to Bernie Sanders like a week before no. Yeah, that's what I mean [[01:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=6962.1s)]
*  That's what I mean. So it's like [[01:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=6967.3s)]
*  You're not you're not gonna like hit him on shit [[01:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=6969.38s)]
*  You're not gonna hit him on like stuff that he has no answer for well [[01:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=6972.52s)]
*  Cuz I think my goal is to find a goal, but I just want to get to know people kind of right. Mm-hmm [[01:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=6976.400000000001s)]
*  And I realized I fell in this trap recently [[01:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=6980.9400000000005s)]
*  I thought that just cuz I had some poly political people on last year that I knew about politics. I do not [[01:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=6983.660000000001s)]
*  That was a trap even my own ego was like, oh maybe I know some politics. I don't know shit now [[01:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=6989.62s)]
*  I have some ideas. I know what it feels like to be kind of like I feel like just a pretty regular person [[01:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=6993.9s)]
*  and then I don't know I try to find empathy here and there and figure things out but [[01:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=6998.7s)]
*  But I'm and I'm learning a lot [[01:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=7003.82s)]
*  I've learned definitely learned a lot more than I knew two years ago for sure [[01:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=7005.419999999999s)]
*  but um [[01:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=7007.9s)]
*  but then to think that I like [[01:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=7008.66s)]
*  you know, I have to be careful not to like smoke mo nuts or whatever it's called where it's like you just [[01:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=7010.179999999999s)]
*  You know just because I had some politics on now I'm fucking you know, Jim Rome or somebody or you know, like a you know, I'm like [[01:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=7015.22s)]
*  Malcolm X [[01:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=7023.900000000001s)]
*  Malcolm X [[01:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=7025.900000000001s)]
*  Yeah, so yeah, but anyway, um, but no dude, I like your attitude. I like your charisma [[01:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=7028.820000000001s)]
*  I like that. I wanted to talk a little bit more about I know you have a [[01:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=7033.9800000000005s)]
*  program where you like try to co-op and put money back in a [[01:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=7037.62s)]
*  Like [[01:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=7041.0199999999995s)]
*  Things that mean something to you in my pocket as a cooperative corporation [[01:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=7042.219999999999s)]
*  So like everyone has equal say equal pay. Yeah, and there are different formations of that [[01:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=7046.7s)]
*  Like you don't have to make it equal pay, but I just thought it would be the best [[01:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=7051.58s)]
*  Possible way to go about it [[01:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=7055.66s)]
*  But it's most importantly a silent equal pay the equal say part is really important [[01:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=7056.98s)]
*  We get together and you know, if someone has a obligation they're not showing up. It's fine [[01:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=7061.0599999999995s)]
*  You know we [[01:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=7066.94s)]
*  We make do we figure it out as we go along and I think that's how you get [[01:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=7068.5s)]
*  That's how you get the most successful a business like for sure [[01:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=7073.98s)]
*  That's that's something that I stand by and we still obviously have to hire contractors every now and then too [[01:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=7077.04s)]
*  Yeah, sure, and we can get together another time and talk about business strategy and things like that. I think it'd be interesting [[01:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=7081.92s)]
*  But yeah, I just wanted to just then yeah, we do a lot of fundraising like the other [[01:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=7087.94s)]
*  The other day I had the no other land the the Palestinians who made the documentary about like they were [[01:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=7092.7s)]
*  Yeah, I had them. Yeah, I had them on my I had them on my house like I they rolled up deep [[01:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=7098.98s)]
*  They had like ten people like the whole family was there no other friends. That's what I [[01:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=7104.839999999999s)]
*  Yeah, they I mean they also like straight up came from, you know occupied Palestinian territory like they fly into America [[01:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=7111.219999999999s)]
*  And and you know we were chillin we were just like talking about [[01:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=7119.02s)]
*  Talking about their experiences and I interviewed them and then in the process like the organization that actually brought them here [[01:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=7123.62s)]
*  Who works with you know a lot of Palestinians on the ground like they were like, oh, can you share this link? [[01:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=7132.14s)]
*  to fundraise [[01:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=7138.1s)]
*  So I did and we we in the hour-long interview that we did we? [[01:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=7139.94s)]
*  Fundraised a hundred thousand hours now is sitting at a hundred and thirty five thousand [[01:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=7144.5s)]
*  but like that's the type of stuff that I love being able to do because like I [[01:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=7148.12s)]
*  Feel so powerless a lot of times when I see all of this death and destruction [[01:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=7152.5s)]
*  And I feel like it's it's a meaningful way to be able to help to to you know, actively fundraise [[01:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=7156.0599999999995s)]
*  gives myself and a lot of people that watch me the opportunity to say like [[01:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=7162.259999999999s)]
*  You know, at least we're trying to do something anything, you know what I mean? [[01:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=7166.82s)]
*  So I I try to do that the best of my ability we've fundraised for [[01:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=7170.98s)]
*  Palestinian aid organizations to the tune of I think like almost more than three million dollars at this point since [[01:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=7175.66s)]
*  Since October 7. Wow. Yeah [[01:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=7182.5s)]
*  Dude, yeah, I've not pretty even saying that because I think it's something I need to hear more about it's on my brain and heart [[01:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=7185.5s)]
*  A lot we started a foundation last year [[01:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=7190.179999999999s)]
*  But haven't started to figure out like what to do with the money or what exactly to do [[01:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=7191.86s)]
*  You know [[01:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=7196.5599999999995s)]
*  Like I would like to create a business that like I thought about like water like you're selling water but the money goes towards [[01:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=7196.9s)]
*  Rehab for people that suffer from opioid addiction, you know that sort of thing [[02:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=7204.679999999999s)]
*  Just so it's like using something that everybody needs but the finally the proceeds it only goes towards this thing [[02:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=7208.0199999999995s)]
*  There's not even a profit. You know, it's like this is what it's for. Yeah [[02:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=7214.66s)]
*  But I need to be more I've done that in the past too, like my like I have merch [[02:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=7218.7s)]
*  And is us made Union made and obviously the margins are incredibly slim for that reason American giant is that dude does your Merchant [[02:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=7223.66s)]
*  No, is it no is Bayside is my garment manufacturer my garment provider is one of the only union shops [[02:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=7230.86s)]
*  that is garment manufacturer in the country that can like [[02:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=7237.3s)]
*  Keep up with the demand that we have because there's a shit ton of people are buying the t-shirts like and sometimes I'll just [[02:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=7241.62s)]
*  Like I will fundraise like by by saying all the proceeds like every single [[02:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=7248.66s)]
*  Point of profit is directly going to a labor union like we I gave the Amazon labor union [[02:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=7254.78s)]
*  I think it was like a hundred seventy thousand dollars or something like that off of just that [[02:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=7261.58s)]
*  We fundraise like I think Amazon packaging the Amazon labor union. Yeah, like the people that work at the distribution facilities [[02:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=7266.179999999999s)]
*  Another thing I did like this past year was for I don't know how to say the name correctly [[02:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=7273.9s)]
*  But right he says it's a it's an organization that works with undocumented migrants in in Texas specifically and they give them [[02:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=7278.82s)]
*  you know [[02:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=7286.78s)]
*  Translators and lawyers and you know, they pay for lawyer fees and stuff like that [[02:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=7288.78s)]
*  So I'm actively working on fundraising initiatives like that [[02:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=7292.38s)]
*  Because I feel like there's a lot of stories that don't get told [[02:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=7298.34s)]
*  That's why I interviewed the incarcerated firefighters [[02:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=7301.86s)]
*  That were combatting the wildfires in LA [[02:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tT3WEcTZy8&t=7306.0599999999995s)]
