*  And then so then we had a big hole in the house and we used to have raccoons in there sometimes it was cool [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esatTEbQ3pk&t=196.76000000000002s)]

*  I was a busboy over there and I did other things too [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esatTEbQ3pk&t=206.08s)]
*  I would sell a little bit of weed, but mostly I was doing dish work [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esatTEbQ3pk&t=208.78s)]
*  but um and [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esatTEbQ3pk&t=212.8s)]
*  When the chef would cook duck when they would make duck [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esatTEbQ3pk&t=214.52s)]
*  They had loose floorboards in the back of the restaurant and they had a lot of raccoons in the wall and one of us bus boys [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esatTEbQ3pk&t=218.16s)]
*  Would have to sit there with a broomstick because the raccoons like the duck smell so they come out the wood, bro [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esatTEbQ3pk&t=224.56s)]
*  And I just sit there just beat him back [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esatTEbQ3pk&t=230.36s)]
*  So I definitely that was a five-star restaurant over there [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esatTEbQ3pk&t=233.68s)]
*  Here in Florida I seen something with the golden corrals [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esatTEbQ3pk&t=244.2s)]

*  Before the UFC days when I was like 7 and 0 7 knockouts [[00:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esatTEbQ3pk&t=3528.24s)]
*  It went through Facebook. It got pretty big buzz. We were trying to make the me verse MVP fights [[00:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esatTEbQ3pk&t=3533.12s)]
*  since back then [[00:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esatTEbQ3pk&t=3540.2799999999997s)]
*  I'm a fan of MVP. He's done some really cool stuff, but I feel like he's always fought people [[00:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esatTEbQ3pk&t=3542.3199999999997s)]
*  That were put there for him to do that to them and [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esatTEbQ3pk&t=3550.16s)]
*  I'm not the one that you can just do that too. So we're both in for a fight here [[00:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esatTEbQ3pk&t=3553.8799999999997s)]
*  I don't think he's the one I think he'll be very hard for me to hit. He's very elusive. He's like a [[00:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esatTEbQ3pk&t=3559.3599999999997s)]
*  That that thing at the car [[00:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esatTEbQ3pk&t=3565.2799999999997s)]

*  Yeah, by this car. Yeah, I'm gonna catch his ass though. Damn [[00:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esatTEbQ3pk&t=3569.52s)]
*  Fuck hit the switch and the air just come down [[00:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esatTEbQ3pk&t=3575.44s)]
*  It's time for me to knock somebody out. It is about time [[00:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esatTEbQ3pk&t=3580.16s)]
*  about time [[00:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esatTEbQ3pk&t=3584.0s)]
*  It's about time man. Do you are do you can you really is there really times you were you are baiting people? [[00:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esatTEbQ3pk&t=3585.48s)]
*  Were you were like, okay, I know I can get them to hit me right here [[00:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esatTEbQ3pk&t=3591.3599999999997s)]
*  Then they're gonna be in a place where I can [[00:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esatTEbQ3pk&t=3594.12s)]
*  Yeah, I mean I just I feel like um, oh that's kind of one thing [[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esatTEbQ3pk&t=3596.44s)]
*  I thought the other day about that moving the head thing is like why move your head if you could just throw a punch [[01:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esatTEbQ3pk&t=3602.48s)]
*  If you can hit them [[01:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esatTEbQ3pk&t=3609.64s)]
*  Instead of dodging them and then not doing shit [[01:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esatTEbQ3pk&t=3612.3199999999997s)]
*  Just hit them [[01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esatTEbQ3pk&t=3615.96s)]
*  That's how I think you see people who fight with their hands down. Oh, yeah [[01:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esatTEbQ3pk&t=3617.68s)]
*  I'll be damned [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esatTEbQ3pk&t=3623.56s)]
*  Michael Vanna page is gonna stand in front of me with his hands down the whole time and [[01:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esatTEbQ3pk&t=3625.68s)]
*  I'm gonna fucking throw punches at him the whole time and make him put his fucking hands up [[01:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esatTEbQ3pk&t=3630.3999999999996s)]
*  I'm gonna hit him. He's gonna have to put his hands up [[01:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esatTEbQ3pk&t=3636.68s)]
*  I think it's so disrespectful when people be there hands down and the other guy just doesn't know how to enter [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esatTEbQ3pk&t=3639.2799999999997s)]
*  Because every time he comes in the dude just throw something up and it lands. It's got power the pocket shot [[01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esatTEbQ3pk&t=3646.3599999999997s)]
*  That's what they call that the pocket shot your hands are down by your pockets [[01:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esatTEbQ3pk&t=3652.64s)]
*  They throw from the hip Roy Jones used to knock a lot of people out like that [[01:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esatTEbQ3pk&t=3655.7999999999997s)]
*  But I'll be damned if someone gonna stand in front of me with their hands down learn how to punch [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esatTEbQ3pk&t=3660.48s)]
*  You gotta just go for it is there about you see maybe even a half outside of your weight class [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esatTEbQ3pk&t=3664.72s)]
*  Do you have any thoughts like of it? [[01:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esatTEbQ3pk&t=3670.52s)]
*  Like are there any UFC bouts that you wanted that you didn't get kind of was there one that kind of you kind of? [[01:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esatTEbQ3pk&t=3672.2799999999997s)]

*  LLC, you know me versus Mike Tyson me versus John Jones me versus Jake Paul me versus [[01:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esatTEbQ3pk&t=3687.3599999999997s)]
*  Logan Paul [[01:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esatTEbQ3pk&t=3694.72s)]
*  Mayweather I'm trying to put myself in a winning category [[01:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esatTEbQ3pk&t=3696.48s)]
*  It's no disrespect obviously me versus Kamara Usman. I mean and I think [[01:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esatTEbQ3pk&t=3699.52s)]
*  You know, that's the thing they want to they want to you know, UFC is pretty big and [[01:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esatTEbQ3pk&t=3707.04s)]
*  It looks good when they're when they're champions when their championship they got their nice looking belt [[01:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esatTEbQ3pk&t=3712.3199999999997s)]
*  They changed the belt the belt used to be kind of cooler, but now it's cool, too [[01:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esatTEbQ3pk&t=3718.56s)]
*  It just looks like a Power Ranger thing now like the old belt honestly [[01:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esatTEbQ3pk&t=3722.96s)]
*  yeah, the fence and the bare knuckles and shit or the brass knuckles or something and [[01:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esatTEbQ3pk&t=3726.52s)]
*  All right. That was like oh anyways [[01:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esatTEbQ3pk&t=3732.96s)]
*  I [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esatTEbQ3pk&t=3736.92s)]
*  Don't you know do I ever want to be so special that I I would look at the sport of bare knuckle boxing and [[01:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esatTEbQ3pk&t=3739.28s)]
*  Not give it its respect and say [[01:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esatTEbQ3pk&t=3748.6800000000003s)]
*  That shit looks terrible I'm not doing that I don't know [[01:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esatTEbQ3pk&t=3752.88s)]
*  It it might look terrible a lot of the times [[01:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esatTEbQ3pk&t=3757.48s)]
*  But when it does look good or when you see someone beat the fuck out of somebody you're like that guy needs a challenge [[01:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esatTEbQ3pk&t=3760.32s)]
*  Right there should be two monsters in there really showing what real combat is like [[01:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esatTEbQ3pk&t=3768.7200000000003s)]
*  bare knuckle punching in the face and [[01:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esatTEbQ3pk&t=3776.1600000000003s)]
*  You can hold a little bit to try to protect yourself [[01:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esatTEbQ3pk&t=3780.0s)]
*  but mostly separate and box and [[01:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esatTEbQ3pk&t=3783.84s)]
*  It feels grittier when you're when I'm watching it man when I'm watching it and I first even learned about it because of you [[01:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esatTEbQ3pk&t=3787.2799999999997s)]
*  That's the first reason I even learned about [[01:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esatTEbQ3pk&t=3793.48s)]
*  That my attention got drawn to it and I was like damn that is fucking [[01:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esatTEbQ3pk&t=3796.04s)]
*  Really real I'm looking to be quite different next time from the first one. I mean Julian Lane was tough [[01:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esatTEbQ3pk&t=3801.7599999999998s)]
*  He was he was strong [[01:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esatTEbQ3pk&t=3808.44s)]
*  I hit him with a lot of shots [[01:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esatTEbQ3pk&t=3812.36s)]
*  and then my hands were busted and I toned down the power a lot on the shots and [[01:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esatTEbQ3pk&t=3815.4s)]
*  The cleanliness but since that fight since everything I've learned from my first bare knuckle fight the the things that you can learn [[01:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esatTEbQ3pk&t=3820.76s)]
*  Only from doing it you can't practice it who's gonna bare knuckle spar you no a lot of people [[01:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esatTEbQ3pk&t=3828.44s)]
*  Nobody and then you don't want to get kids well bar and training all that you're both gonna be cut and have to go get [[01:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esatTEbQ3pk&t=3835.7200000000003s)]
*  Stitches that's gonna cost thousands of dollars [[01:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esatTEbQ3pk&t=3841.48s)]
*  so [[01:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esatTEbQ3pk&t=3844.44s)]
*  You know the [[01:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esatTEbQ3pk&t=3846.44s)]
*  You can't practice it you can only learn from jumping in the ring and [[01:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esatTEbQ3pk&t=3849.6400000000003s)]
*  Trying it out and doing it [[01:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esatTEbQ3pk&t=3853.76s)]
*  So once I did that now I've been finding out more about my knuckles about my punching ability about how the shots should land [[01:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esatTEbQ3pk&t=3855.44s)]
*  And you training differently yeah, I've really been [[01:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esatTEbQ3pk&t=3863.16s)]
*  focused on [[01:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esatTEbQ3pk&t=3867.2s)]
*  You know there's some there's some days I go in the gym, and I'll beat the bag up [[01:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esatTEbQ3pk&t=3869.3199999999997s)]
*  bare knuckle sometimes I wrap the wrists and beat about bare knuckle and [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esatTEbQ3pk&t=3875.24s)]
*  Then I get carried away [[01:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esatTEbQ3pk&t=3880.08s)]
*  And then I can't use my hands for a week because I just destroyed I burn all the skin on them [[01:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esatTEbQ3pk&t=3881.48s)]
*  I get these big nasty scabs and then my bones get so hard that like I [[01:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esatTEbQ3pk&t=3887.96s)]
*  You know what you can't even lift up a muffin [[01:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esatTEbQ3pk&t=3894.16s)]

*  Yeah, I just got a ice bath not too long ago. It's good [[01:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esatTEbQ3pk&t=3922.56s)]
