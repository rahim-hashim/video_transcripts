*  hurry it up. We want to enjoy ourselves when we come. New York City, Las Vegas, Uncasville, [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=44.96s)]

*  What's up guys? My name's Theo and I'm a human. I am. What's going on? I've been [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=67.44s)]
*  been running around a lot. Been, you know, on the go. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=81.44s)]
*  You know, I mean, just, I feel like the Lord just put that go, Celine in me. You know, that [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=86.72s)]
*  91 octane or whatever. And I've been burning, boy. I've been go, go, going. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=94.4s)]
*  And sometimes it's hard to get a moment to, well, it's hard to get a moment these days. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=100.32s)]
*  You know, I think about that a lot and it's hard for me to like get a moment [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=111.91999999999999s)]
*  where it's like, okay, this is a moment that's not where I'm not being pulled or pushed or [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=119.19999999999999s)]
*  interrupted or overwhelmed or well overwhelms. Okay. But where I'm not being like, [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=124.0s)]
*  where I'm not needing or wanting anything except for [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=132.8s)]
*  some of my own time. Like I just want to have enough peace or whatever going on so I can evaluate [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=139.28s)]
*  where I am. Sometimes things are so busy, so hectic, you don't even know what's going on. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=150.16s)]
*  You haven't even looked at, you know, sometimes you're so busy, you don't even look at, you know, [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=155.68s)]
*  you'll take your pulse in the evening and you're dead. You were dead. You died in the morning. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=160.88s)]
*  You didn't even know it because you just been, you just kept, you know, you were just running on [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=165.44s)]
*  fewnty, but you kept going. You're like, damn, well you died and you run into a buddy. He's like, [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=171.84s)]
*  oh damn, you're dead. Dude, you got to lay down. You're dead. You know, you died earlier. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=177.44s)]
*  But that's what it's like these days. Things get so busy that, [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=184.72s)]
*  you know, I don't know if I'm living sometimes or if I'm doing a to-do list. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=190.48s)]
*  And then I don't know whose to-do list it is sometimes. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=199.2s)]
*  I don't know if it's my own things that I want to be doing. Is it things that I feel like [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=201.68s)]
*  people want me to be doing? Like whose expectations am I living up to? Or am I chasing? [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=210.0s)]
*  Or am I chasing? Or am I trying to fulfill? [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=225.76000000000002s)]
*  That's what I wonder sometimes. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=234.4s)]
*  And I can just ask myself, well, hey, who's, is this your dream you're doing? Is this your [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=239.76000000000002s)]
*  goal you're doing? Is this, and it can be anything, anything you're doing throughout your day or, [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=246.16s)]
*  you know, if in your plans or in your week or something that you're a current, you know, job or [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=250.56s)]
*  undertaking, a relationship even. It could be anything that you're doing or committing yourself [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=258.96s)]
*  to. And I just ask myself sometimes, whose, whose goal is this? Whose expectation, is this mine? [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=265.59999999999997s)]
*  Is this my parents? Is this a God? Is this, what am I doing? And for whom am I doing it? [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=281.04s)]
*  And so I think, yes, some of the, getting some moments of time where I have to myself, [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=298.32s)]
*  you know, I just, I need that to touch base with myself and [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=304.96000000000004s)]
*  just to look at the charts, you know? It's like sometimes you don't look at your chart, [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=310.48s)]
*  you don't look at your own, you don't take enough inventory of yourself and, [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=316.08000000000004s)]
*  you know, yeah, you don't even know what's going on. You finally look at your chart and you're [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=322.32s)]
*  like, yeah, damn, I, you know, I took a wrong turn four months ago, but I just didn't even, [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=325.12s)]
*  you know, I didn't stop and look at where I've been [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=333.20000000000005s)]
*  because I just think that if I keep going, [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=335.04s)]
*  I'll get some, I'll get, I don't know. I don't know, I'm kind of rambling, [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=347.28000000000003s)]
*  but sometimes these days you get so busy, you don't even, you know, [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=352.96000000000004s)]
*  by the time you look at your, your chart, you were supposed to, you died a week ago [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=356.64000000000004s)]
*  and you're just out here, damn ghost and doing stuff, making wagers online and, [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=362.08s)]
*  you know, going, buying stuff at Trader Joe's and shit and you're supposed to be deceased [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=370.08s)]
*  and you're like, oh damn, I didn't even, I was so busy, you know, living or doing that I didn't [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=377.68s)]
*  even realize I was damn gone. That's how busy you can get these days. It feels like [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=384.0s)]
*  anyway, sorry if that was kind of a down or I didn't mean to be a Debbie downer or whatever, [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=390.88000000000005s)]
*  but I just, yeah, I think I've just been running so much. It's I'm trying to get a little bit of, [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=395.12s)]
*  take some inventory of myself and see what the hell, what's, what's going on with you? [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=402.0s)]
*  How are you? What's up? So, and I've been, I think I've been a little bit burnt out. You know, [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=405.6s)]
*  I got to get a week off sometime soon. I'm going to take a, I'm going to take a week off. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=413.36s)]
*  I got to get a week off sometime soon. I'm going to take a vacation [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=417.76s)]
*  and a vacation. That's just where, [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=425.92s)]
*  I mean, that's kind of where you tell, [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=431.03999999999996s)]
*  that's where you tell time to kind of hold your nuts, bro. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=435.36s)]
*  So yeah, let me do that. Let me, [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=443.2s)]
*  let me think about what I've been. Let me take a moment. I feel, [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=448.64s)]
*  you know, I've been worried recently about my own ego. I've been worried a lot about my own ego. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=457.12s)]
*  Just because the ego, it's such a sneaky thing. It's like your shadow, but, [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=467.59999999999997s)]
*  but it's on the inside of you. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=471.35999999999996s)]
*  And its goal is to, [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=476.08s)]
*  is to, is to trick you to think that you're having self-confidence. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=485.84s)]
*  That's what I think. Let me see. What is it? Ego. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=492.0s)]
*  A person's sense of self-esteem or self-importance. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=494.4s)]
*  The part of the mind that mediates between the conscious and the unconscious [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=503.92s)]
*  and is responsible for a sense of personal identity. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=510.0s)]
*  Yeah, I think I've been thinking about that for a long time. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=515.2s)]
*  And is responsible for a sense of personal identity. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=518.24s)]
*  Yeah, I think I just, I think I've just been worried about my ego a little. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=523.52s)]
*  You know, I think there's, things have just kind of gotten busier and stuff. And so I just, [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=529.92s)]
*  I just worry about it. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=535.6s)]
*  You know, I want to be, I want to try and be, [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=539.36s)]
*  you know, I can just feel it flare up here and there. Like, [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=543.68s)]
*  um, or why isn't this this way? Or why, you know, expecting things to be perfect, expecting, [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=548.0s)]
*  and it's not like I deserve them to be perfect, but it's still, it's an expectation that things [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=557.2s)]
*  should be or things, why aren't things going smoothly? Why, you know, so I just, I just want [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=561.6s)]
*  to have awareness of that because that's the word, man, if you have, if your ego is leading the drive, [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=567.2s)]
*  it's not even you. That's not even, it's you, but it's you just, you're working for this, [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=575.76s)]
*  you working for a damn dirty landlord, brother, if your ego is running the show. So anyway, [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=585.76s)]
*  that's been something that's been going on. What else? Um, yeah, I want to take a vacation. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=592.16s)]
*  So I'm going to do that sometime. And, uh, [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=597.76s)]
*  yeah, just still battling, trying to stay off the vapes. It's been a war. I had five days at one [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=601.3599999999999s)]
*  point and then I seceded, I seceded, uh, to the union or whatever. I don't know what I seceded [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=608.16s)]
*  to, but I gave up and I just damn hit that bitch son. And I've been, I've been, I've been, I've been [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=615.5999999999999s)]
*  on them, bro. God, I've been on them. Dude, you, I mean, [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=623.6800000000001s)]
*  if you wrote damn vapes in here, dude, inside of it, right out, if you wrote, if you wrote, [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=631.12s)]
*  if you wrote vapes in here on the outside of a wishing well, and you came there at night with [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=637.9200000000001s)]
*  a flashlight and looked down in there, I'd be in there and I'd be damn just wishing for vapes. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=644.72s)]
*  And so anyway, that's what's been going on, dude. I just wanted to touch, just check in, um, [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=654.64s)]
*  of things that have just kind of been on my mind and heart a little bit. And, uh, yeah, [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=662.08s)]
*  we'll get into some episode, man. It's been an exciting few weeks. I'm sorry that I haven't [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=667.44s)]
*  gotten to be here with you guys for one-on-one hanging out. Um, let's get into it and then we'll, [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=671.04s)]
*  uh, and then we'll be into it. Praise God, baby. Gang. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=677.1999999999999s)]
*  Ooh. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=701.04s)]
*  You can see the cigarette burns on the wall. And all the empty bottles in the hall. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=705.68s)]
*  If the water gets too rough, you know who to call. Don't you, baby? [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=714.0s)]
*  And I can see the way it looks in your eyes. Come on, baby. A soul so lost with its foolish lies. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=721.92s)]

*  Something happened to Mr. Ray and so we had to go to Miss Bobby or Miss Billy. I can't remember [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=1522.88s)]
*  her name, Bobby or Billy. And they wanted her to be a man. You could tell you sold pictures of her. [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=1526.72s)]
*  They'd always, her daddy had dressed her up like a man when she was a kid and they brought even, [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=1531.76s)]
*  you'd see somebody write man, man in here on her back. Somebody would write that on her back and [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=1537.92s)]
*  she'd have a picture of her in college and somebody written man in here on her back. I think [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=1545.6000000000001s)]
*  that might've been the original trans was somebody just writing man in here, man in here [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=1551.44s)]
*  on her back. And we got it. Everybody got the point. You didn't have to get the section. You [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=1560.16s)]
*  didn't have to do all of that. So it really saves a lot of money, which I think that's nice. You [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=1566.0s)]
*  write man in here on each arm. You show that to me when I roll up, I get it. All right, Bridget, [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=1572.64s)]
*  I'll call you Bradley. I get it. Boom. That's it. We don't need, you know, we don't need a lot of [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=1578.32s)]
*  other insanity around it. If you trans and out, we've all, everybody, damn, sometimes I feel like a [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=1584.24s)]
*  little bitch. You feel me? Sometimes I feel like three tenths of a bitch, [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=1591.44s)]
*  you know? And I kind of see what I, you know, I'll let it pass or something. I remember, [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=1601.28s)]
*  I don't know. I guess I don't have a lot of him. I've, I never put on panties or nothing, [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=1608.4s)]
*  but anyway, so let me get through the story. So she was the haircutter and I was over there one time [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=1613.92s)]
*  and my mom would drop me off because that old lady, she was real chatty. She'd talk to me. She [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=1619.92s)]
*  damn, she talked to you by the time she got done talking to you, you know, it was, she was 91. If [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=1623.68s)]
*  she 90, she's not, it was just like, dang, man. So she kept talking and so mom would drop me off [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=1631.2s)]
*  there. Mom would drop me off there and, and I got the cut. I get that trim. But one time I was in [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=1638.0s)]
*  there, she had a stroke, right? And she's laying on the ground with the scissors, you know, and I'd [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=1645.04s)]
*  never been around somebody that had a stroke. I didn't know what it was. And so I just sat there, [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=1650.48s)]
*  man. You know, I feel bad about it. I was well behaved, but I sat there for probably [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=1656.56s)]
*  15 minutes. And I thought she was just being real quiet or something, or I don't know what I thought. [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=1663.92s)]
*  Maybe she was doing hide and go seek, but she just [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=1671.2s)]
*  forgot to hide and thought she was hiding or something. I don't know what I thought at that [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=1676.16s)]
*  age, but I remember just being in that room and it was quiet as could be. [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=1679.68s)]
*  And then her son came or something and he's like, what the hell happened in here? And he called me [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=1687.2s)]
*  a f**k it. [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=1692.56s)]
*  Anyway, what else, man? Sorry, I'm just going off on it. That's where I'm at. I'm all over the place. [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=1693.6s)]
*  I just got back from, I just got back from Medford, Massachusetts, over there at the casino ballroom. [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=1700.1599999999999s)]
*  I just got back from [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=1714.0s)]
*  Medford, Massachusetts, over there at the casino ballroom. And that was an interesting venue for [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=1718.0s)]
*  comedy. I appreciate everybody that came out. The setup of it isn't ideal for comedy, but a nice [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=1726.56s)]
*  staff over there. Beautiful and a lot of beautiful people that came out and, God, it was freezing and [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=1734.72s)]
*  it was bizarre and freezing over there. [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=1742.56s)]
*  Next time we'll try to find a venue that's a little more suited for comedy. I think for rock [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=1747.76s)]
*  and roll or for if you're going to see a Lil Peep reenactment, or if Disney does Lil Peep on ice or [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=1751.36s)]
*  whatever, then I think it's great. But I think for comedy, for me, it was tough because I like [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=1761.6s)]
*  everybody to be able to see me in the front. And this came around the sides a little bit. [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=1766.64s)]
*  But I was thinking about that. I was like, how do I, the second night, I was like, how do I [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=1775.3600000000001s)]
*  adjust the show so everybody can see perfectly? Anyway, we did our best and I just want to thank [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=1779.8400000000001s)]
*  everybody who came out there, who came out in Houston, who came out previously before that in [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=1786.48s)]
*  Boston, down there in Corpus Christi. Yeah, it's just been a lot of places. I didn't get to do as [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=1792.96s)]
*  many pop outs into the lobby to thank people. We tried some this weekend. The lobbies were small. [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=1802.96s)]
*  In Houston, we did one night or two nights we came out and it was just pretty chaotic. [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=1811.8400000000001s)]
*  So we're just trying our best. I'll try my best to pop out there afterwards [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=1818.48s)]
*  for people that are kind of hanging around. But I just want to let you know that because [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=1824.8799999999999s)]
*  some people would send me a DM and be like, we came out, you had already been gone by the time [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=1831.28s)]
*  we got out there. Sometimes we didn't get to do it. But we try and I just want to let you know that [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=1839.52s)]
*  I think about that. What else? Oh, Billy Conforto's brother came out and his name is Chuck. [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=1844.72s)]
*  Chuck Mintz. Named after the candy, I think, but they spell it different. [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=1856.96s)]
*  They spell it different. And everybody, a lot of you guys know Billy Conforto and you remember him. [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=1864.16s)]
*  And man, he was, you know, Billy was the first, he was a homosexual [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=1872.0s)]
*  kind of prize fighter slash busboy. That was a lot of, you know, I would say those were his [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=1884.8799999999999s)]
*  domains really. And he would, you know, he'd damn, you know, he'd hand job a male waiter and he'd [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=1894.4s)]
*  have, but at the same, with the other hand, he'd be, you know, cleaning up a foretop. [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=1902.72s)]
*  So he'd be polishing off a one top and a four, he'd be, you know, he could do a bottom and a [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=1908.24s)]
*  foretop at the same time. That's who he was. And when I met him, we were working at like a [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=1915.92s)]
*  fine dining type of place, but nobody ever came in there. So we were just [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=1923.76s)]
*  doing whippets mostly. And we did so many whippets one time he just told me that he was gay. [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=1931.36s)]
*  And I think that that, and that was the first gay human I'd ever met. [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=1937.76s)]
*  And anyway, he and I became good friends over the years and, and he would sell, he sold, [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=1944.24s)]
*  he sold a lot of good weed. I think it was good. Now I'll say this. [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=1949.92s)]
*  He had, Billy also had a lot of attack animals. He had attack animals. [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=1957.6000000000001s)]
*  And if you don't know what that is, go up to an animal and, [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=1966.64s)]
*  and if you get attacked, then now you know. So he had a, he had a lot of pit bulls and he would [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=1971.52s)]
*  train them. I mean, these things were, he'd be like, Oh, it's the nicest dog, Dio, bro. It's [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=1986.0s)]
*  the nicest dog. And then you go pet it and it would, it would fucking rearrange your fingers on your [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=1991.04s)]
*  hand. So he would get you, you get, you, you get high with him and then the dog would be so scary [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=1996.88s)]
*  that I would be, I'd be on the furniture. I'd be hanging from the ceiling fan. So I think a lot of [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=2003.44s)]
*  people, they would see that they'd be like, damn, that's the best weed in the world. This dude's [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=2011.6000000000001s)]
*  hanging on, you know, this dude's doing interior design in the house. He's, you know, he's living [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=2016.5600000000002s)]
*  in one of the dresser drawers. This guy's fucked up. That must be the gas weed. Right. So anyway, [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=2023.36s)]
*  but the truth was he had a dangerous animals. And if you bring an attack animal with you [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=2030.7199999999998s)]
*  and you get somebody high, even on skunk weed, then suddenly your shit is the greatest shit they have. [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=2034.7199999999998s)]
*  Because if somebody sees, you know, somebody take a couple puffs of your stuff and then they've run [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=2042.32s)]
*  across the field yelling, help me. They're going to be like, damn, that's killer weed. [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=2047.44s)]
*  But really that's just killer. And he's just, you know, four year old American pit bull rescue. [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=2054.7200000000003s)]
*  So, but his brother came out, man, and that was beautiful to get to spend time with him. That was [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=2062.88s)]
*  in Baton Rouge. I don't think I mentioned that. And he brought his Billy Conforto's niece and [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=2068.4s)]
*  nephew. And it was good to see that their births weren't affected by drugs or anything. [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=2076.0s)]
*  You know, they were two able bodied children and mentally able and very kind. [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=2083.44s)]
*  And it was just great, man. It was great. It was like I was there with Billy for a minute. You know, [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=2093.12s)]
*  it was pretty special. And what else? We reached out over there to do a special plaque or something [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=2098.0s)]
*  for him in Louisiana. And so far the places that we've reached out there over there in Mandeville, [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=2106.72s)]
*  we have gotten denied so far. So we're still seeing what we can do. We want to do something a little [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=2113.12s)]
*  bit like nicer, something, you know, you can't just do it. If you call any place, they say, [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=2118.96s)]
*  oh, you can do it. Or, you know, everybody can't call and put up a, you know, a peach tree [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=2125.6s)]
*  for, you know, somebody for Boo Radley or whoever died because it would be all trees. So you have to [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=2135.04s)]
*  do something different. So I don't know, we'll figure it out. But I just wanted everybody to [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=2141.92s)]
*  know and on the YouTube, we've got pictures of his family that came out. What else? I'm going to have [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=2145.6s)]
*  a sip of water right now. I'm going to take a moment for myself and have a sip of water. [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=2152.4s)]
*  Praise God, baby. I'm upstairs. [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=2164.08s)]
*  What else, man? I went on a little coffee date yesterday. I met up with a gal and [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=2173.12s)]
*  we had a little coffee and she showed up. I think she was on some type of, [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=2182.48s)]
*  she seemed like she was on [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=2188.48s)]
*  stimulants. I'll say that. I think she was on damn stimulants, bro. [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=2193.36s)]
*  Because I was, [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=2203.6s)]
*  she was like trying to listen fast. You ever talk to somebody and they just keep getting closer to [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=2207.52s)]
*  you, bro? Like they just, like they're not going to hear your next word. They're going to try and [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=2211.6s)]
*  fuck it, you know? Like they just like, boy, you put that word out here, I'm going to fuck that thing. [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=2220.56s)]
*  Like that, she was just seemed like real stimulated. So I think she was on some damn [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=2228.64s)]
*  stimulants, man. So I just ordered a salad and chatted with her for maybe [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=2234.4s)]
*  27 minutes. Then we took a little walk around on the sun, went in the sun [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=2240.96s)]
*  because I like staying in the sun when I walk. And then that was it. Went our separate ways. [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=2248.96s)]
*  Oh man, I long for the days when I could, whenever everything felt [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=2256.64s)]
*  normal, when everything felt a little bit more categorized inside of me [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=2266.3199999999997s)]
*  and specifically in my brain. And so that's where I started noticing for myself. I got to slow things [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=2271.2s)]
*  down a little bit and give things a little bit of an opportunity. But I got Zach here. Zach's going [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=2275.68s)]
*  to help me with the news today. Producer Zach, how are we? I'm good. I need one second, but I'm good. [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=2281.68s)]
*  Okay. Hold on. Give me a second. No, take a moment for yourself, man. That's what we're talking about [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=2289.44s)]
*  today. But cut that audio off if you don't mind so we can have our moment too, while you're having [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=2294.0s)]
*  your moment. You know, silence, that's going to become part of a premium. I noticed that. [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=2300.48s)]
*  You go a place now and there's 17 screens going and there's a damn violin and there's somebody [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=2306.16s)]
*  playing a machine gun and there's all kinds of stuff. You know, it's hard to get a little peace [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=2316.16s)]
*  these days. And that's one thing that was nice up there in New Hampshire. One thing that was nice was [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=2328.3999999999996s)]
*  the Wentworth Hotel. And man, if you could bring that up, Zachy. [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=2336.3199999999997s)]
*  This place is, and I think a lot of people go there for the summertime. But let me tell you, [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=2346.64s)]
*  you want a good night, you want some peace and quiet. You want some, you want quiet and quiet. [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=2353.04s)]
*  Peace is like a little louder than quiet, right? You want quiet and quiet. [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=2360.16s)]
*  That's it. Wentworth Hotel. Can you see it? Here we go. There we go. Take a gander at it. [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=2368.96s)]
*  Now I'll say this. It's a little pricey. It's not crazy though, but it's a little pricey. [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=2378.48s)]
*  But I think it's the kind of place where you're investing in what you get on your return. [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=2384.48s)]
*  I felt fortunate that we could stay there and I really, really liked it. [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=2390.32s)]
*  But it's quiet. I mean, they don't even, [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=2395.6s)]
*  it's quiet. Just think of something real quiet, Zach. What is it? [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=2400.8s)]
*  Like a, like do you ever have a computer in your room and you're like going to sleep at night and [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=2405.76s)]
*  the computer's running? Like a little fan. Like a fan in the computer, you mean? Yeah, [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=2415.6000000000004s)]
*  like a fan running the computer. Yeah. That's not that quiet. Is that quiet or not quiet, you think? [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=2422.0800000000004s)]
*  You want to go quieter than that? Yeah. Yeah. Like what is as quiet as something can be? [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=2430.0800000000004s)]
*  What's the quietest you ever been, be honest. [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=2436.6400000000003s)]
*  When I was, I went to my friend John's house one time when I was a kid and he wasn't there [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=2442.96s)]
*  and his parents were fucking. So I just, I listened for a little bit and then I, [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=2446.7200000000003s)]
*  I got out of there. Wow. What made you get out? Was it a certain, did something, was there a certain, [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=2456.6400000000003s)]
*  did they shift gears or something? Did something, was there a part where you're like, okay, [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=2463.12s)]
*  this is too much? Because yeah, that's real quiet. When you're trying to be so quiet that you are, [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=2466.8s)]
*  yeah, if you're listening to somebody else mate or fight, if you're listening to like [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=2473.28s)]
*  putting your ear to the wall, like your original reality television was putting your ear to the [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=2480.56s)]
*  wall, right? Before they had all the shows, it was peeping, tomming or putting your ear to the wall. [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=2484.08s)]
*  And there'd be no, you'd, yeah, you would stop. I remember literally I would squeeze my ribs like [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=2489.68s)]
*  this to keep my heart from even making that sound that it makes. So I could, I didn't want to miss [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=2497.04s)]
*  one moment. I didn't want that commercial break of my heartbeat to interrupt the, just the pristine, [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=2503.2s)]
*  pure reality television I was getting by listening to my neighbors fight or have sex. [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=2510.48s)]
*  Or both. I remember one time people were definitely, somebody kept punching somebody [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=2515.2s)]
*  and then you could hear them just, just damn ejaculate. So what was it? [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=2520.24s)]
*  What do you mean? [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=2531.9199999999996s)]
*  What were you saying? You said, oh, and so what caused you to leave? [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=2533.3599999999997s)]
*  Oh, I just, you know, they were, they were kind of going at it and [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=2536.3199999999997s)]
*  it was like my best friend. And if I'm being honest, his mom was hot and that was kind of a factor in it too. [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=2540.8799999999997s)]
*  But I mean, you know how that, like, I felt like I couldn't, it felt like illegal to be there. [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=2549.8399999999997s)]
*  Yeah. Oh, it's hard to, there's definitely, it's hard to listen to somebody you care about's mom [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=2555.4399999999996s)]
*  getting plugged up by somebody. Thank you. Yeah. I appreciate that, man. But yeah, [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=2563.68s)]
*  there were, oh, I remember God, the neighbor woman. If I got in the neighbor woman's hamper, I damn, [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=2576.08s)]
*  I remember just, I would just stay in there, dude, [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=2582.64s)]
*  and just smell all her clothes. And I remember just wishing that she was my mom. [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=2588.08s)]
*  I remember that. What else we got the news hit us with some of it, Zach. We got to get to some calls. [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=2593.68s)]
*  A lot of calls have come into the hotline. Nine eight five six six four nine five zero three. [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=2601.3599999999997s)]
*  That's something we saw. Panagon did a new study and it says 77% of Americans are too fat, [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=2608.72s)]
*  mentally ill or on drugs to join the military. [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=2615.04s)]
*  Okay. Well, let me see about this. 77% of young Americans go to the information here. [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=2618.48s)]
*  And what are they saying there? Pentagon study revealed that 77% of young Americans do not [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=2625.6800000000003s)]
*  qualify for military service without a waiver due to being overweight. So they're not good out of [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=2630.96s)]
*  the gate. They would have to make an exception, right? Okay. Over the overweight. What else? [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=2635.84s)]
*  Drug use. Drug and alcohol abuse is 8%. Medical, physical health, 7%. [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=2642.2400000000002s)]
*  These are the percentage of people who didn't get in. And mostly though it's overweight. [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=2648.48s)]
*  Okay. And that's between the ages of, let's give real information here, please. Go back down. [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=2653.6000000000004s)]
*  That's between the ages of 17 and 24. Okay. Several key findings. Go on more, please. Several [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=2659.2000000000003s)]
*  key findings were noted in the summary report. For example, most ineligible youth, 44%, [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=2668.48s)]
*  are disqualified for multiple reasons rather than in only one area. Would you have any of these you [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=2673.52s)]
*  think, Zach? Yeah. I don't think I'd make the weight cut. What is there a weight cut? Do you know it? [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=2678.48s)]
*  I don't know what the number is, but I don't think I'm there, dog. [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=2688.16s)]
*  And that's okay, man. And any of the other ones? Because it says with one, you could probably get [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=2693.12s)]
*  a waiver. Well, I could get a waiver for the overweight and then I can lie about the [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=2696.72s)]
*  mental, like if there are any, you can just kind of lie about all that stuff. That's true, huh? [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=2703.3599999999997s)]
*  Yeah. The weight, you can't lie about it, you know? So if you can just get a waiver for that, then [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=2708.0s)]
*  what's the problem? Yeah. Yeah. It's weird that you can't really dress in black enough to look [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=2711.8399999999997s)]
*  like you're not on Lexapro or something. You know? Yeah. But okay. So the weight would keep you out [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=2717.44s)]
*  and you would be able to lie about the... Yeah, I'd lie about the other stuff and then we're good. [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=2727.84s)]
*  Yeah. And that's our military. And I could get in shape. I feel like it's, you know, [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=2732.64s)]
*  like couldn't they get us in shape? Maybe so. So that's the news, the largest increase. And [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=2736.8s)]
*  I'm not shocked. Go back up to the top of it there, bub. Americans are too fat. I mean, [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=2743.76s)]
*  definitely. There are some places you can, there's people that you can see people and they are bigger [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=2750.5600000000004s)]
*  than when they got here. And even if you'd have took them as a baby and put them, did like age [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=2757.92s)]
*  progression, they would have never got to where they are now. There's people that are bigger. [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=2764.7200000000003s)]
*  And so that's, this also shows where we are in time, I think. I think if we, it's been a while [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=2768.64s)]
*  since we, you really felt like a calling as a regular person. Look, there's no draft. [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=2776.32s)]
*  There's no anything that has to, you have to stay on your toes. There's no mandatory service. So [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=2781.76s)]
*  yeah, people, I think you're going to get fat. You're going to get mentally ill. A lot of that [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=2790.24s)]
*  goes in hand in hand too. I don't want to say that, but you know, your brain is part of your body. [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=2794.96s)]
*  If somebody cracked your body open, your brain's going to be in it. And so if you got gristle on [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=2801.44s)]
*  your body, you could have gristle on your brain. It might show up differently. That's why sometimes [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=2808.08s)]
*  I feel like if there were a war, if there were a big like something that would call everybody [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=2813.6s)]
*  together and bring everybody like, okay, we're on the same team. You almost wonder if the dark [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=2818.32s)]
*  artists that are out there that are stirring the cauldrons, you know, that are putting the ingredients [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=2823.76s)]
*  into all of this, if that's what they're aiming for. What else we got, Zach? [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=2830.0800000000004s)]
*  NASA announced the first crew that's going to go to the moon for the first, first crew in 50 years, [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=2835.76s)]
*  I should say that's going to go to the moon. This is them. Okay. We got a brother in there. Definitely [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=2840.1600000000003s)]

*  moon and come back. So they're not going to land on it. FYI. Oh, this sounds like, [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=2849.36s)]
*  John Glenn, he did the orbit. No, this sounds like, [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=2855.28s)]
*  BangBus is going to space or something. But yeah. Okay. Great. Another people are going around the [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=2861.28s)]

*  But what are we doing? What who can't, you know what I'm saying? I feel like we've been around [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=2874.6400000000003s)]
*  the moon. What are we, are we just trying to like, and is this NASA? It feels like kind of like a [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=2877.76s)]
*  soft way for NASA to kind of strike back against some of these more private firms that are going [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=2882.0s)]
*  out there. You know, they're sending a brother out there. I respect that. You know, Brothers in Space, [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=2887.1200000000003s)]

*  saying? You put six brothers either in space or at a Bruce Springsteen concert. And that's, [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=2899.6800000000003s)]
*  that's solid gold. That's, you know, but yeah, Brothers in Space has got to be, [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=2907.12s)]
*  I mean, that would win movie of the year. What else we got? [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=2913.2799999999997s)]

*  unlawful possession of the eagle. Yeah. So just owning it or just possessing it. Yeah. So I don't [[00:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=3223.68s)]
*  know. I mean, I think, look, it's one eagle. Well, they're a protected species. Who? The illegal [[00:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=3232.08s)]

*  All right. And that's Zach from Cincinnati. [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=3280.96s)]
*  I wanted to take my glasses off to kind of just out of respect to think about this next part. [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=3286.7200000000003s)]
*  They had a shooting here in Nashville last week and it was, I'd never been in something like that. [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=3296.88s)]
*  I'd never been that close to something like that. I'd never been. I saw a couple brothers [[00:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=3305.44s)]
*  shoot each other. One of them shot each other in the back one time outside of, I want to say, [[00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=3314.64s)]
*  Dairy Queen, maybe. Something like that. One of those kind of shooty, urban kind of restaurants. [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=3323.52s)]
*  But I'd never seen something like, I'd never been around something like this when this had happened. [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=3330.4s)]
*  I'd never been around something like in the environment and you're in traffic and people [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=3338.96s)]
*  can't get, you can't get somewhere, but you know it's because all the parents in traffic are trying [[00:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=3344.32s)]
*  to locate their children. And it's just, I mean, it's, you almost want to, you want to get in the [[00:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=3349.6s)]
*  way because you want to try and do something, but you can't, there's nothing you can do. [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=3358.24s)]
*  It's just such an abrupt, insane finality when that happens. [[00:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=3365.2s)]
*  And I think I just, my heart goes out to obviously all those people. I think I keep those people in [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=3372.4799999999996s)]
*  my prayers and they say that prayers don't help. But prayers are for Pete. Prayers are for comfort. [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=3377.7599999999998s)]
*  It's just taking a moment outside of yourself to think of some comfort for someone. It's just, [[00:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=3386.16s)]
*  it's saying, hey, here, this moment in my life that feels peaceful, I want to give it to you [[00:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=3394.3199999999997s)]
*  because you need it more than I do right now. That's what a prayer is to me. I don't think, [[00:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=3400.3999999999996s)]
*  I'm not sitting there praying no guns or praying like, don't people shouldn't shoot, like, [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=3406.7999999999997s)]
*  don't people shouldn't shoot, like, I don't know, everybody looks at it differently. I'm [[00:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=3411.68s)]
*  not trying to get into that discussion. So I think what I was thinking of is just how do we get, [[00:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=3415.68s)]
*  how do you end up with people that do this type of thing? How do you end up with these, you know, [[00:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=3420.72s)]
*  childhood shooters? How do you end up with people that go into a school [[00:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=3427.44s)]
*  and do this? And I think a lot of it is, to me, a lot of it is a societal thing. And I'm not going to, [[00:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=3432.8799999999997s)]
*  everybody has their views. I'm not challenging your view here. This is just a space for sharing [[00:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=3439.2s)]
*  what I think and I could be wrong. That's totally okay. But I feel and I think sometimes that [[00:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=3444.16s)]
*  people don't have purpose. You have a country where, you know, it used to feel like, like, [[00:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=3454.24s)]
*  if you worked at a, I'm going to go off on some different thoughts here. So if you worked at, [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=3461.44s)]
*  like, a business, then you had a lot of middle class businesses. You had a lot of smaller [[00:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=3465.2s)]
*  businesses. And if you worked there, then if the company did well, you did well. And so you had a [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=3470.96s)]
*  sense of purpose, maybe through your work. You know, you're going to move up the ladder, you were [[00:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=3476.48s)]
*  going to be, you know, a foreman and then a manager and then maybe have some percentage share. And then, [[00:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=3480.64s)]
*  you know, you were going to get to a place. And now it feels, I think, like we've, [[00:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=3490.3199999999997s)]
*  we've let a lot of our companies get to these big conglomerates. And it's about the bottom line. [[00:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=3496.16s)]
*  A lot of companies are beholding to their shareholders, but not to their [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=3504.16s)]
*  sharecroppers, if you will, to the people working within the company. [[00:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=3509.8399999999997s)]
*  So then what I'm saying is as a person, you may not feel any people, you, I feel like you people [[00:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=3514.16s)]
*  can get a sense of purpose from their work. So if you don't have that sense of purpose, then, [[00:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=3521.28s)]
*  then you can be pretty aimless, right? And then if you don't have love, like if somebody doesn't love [[00:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=3527.52s)]
*  you or you feel unloved or you don't love somebody, like if you don't have a family or a husband or [[00:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=3532.32s)]
*  wife or children, then you may not feel like a lot of love, right? And so having love gives you [[00:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=3540.48s)]
*  a sense of purpose. So, and we have less families these days, the familial structure is really kind [[00:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=3547.6s)]
*  of broken down in America. You know, you have a lot of single parent homes, you have a lot of two [[00:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=3555.12s)]
*  parents having to work. So right there, we're kind of, right there, there's a place where people [[00:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=3560.4s)]
*  were, I feel like people used to get a lot of purpose. And now a lot of, there's people that [[00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=3568.4s)]
*  aren't getting purpose from their work and there's people that aren't getting purpose from [[00:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=3575.28s)]
*  their heart being fulfilled by someone else or them being the piece that fills someone else's heart. [[00:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=3581.2000000000003s)]
*  So right there, I mean, you have a lot, you have people who don't have a lot of purpose. [[00:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=3589.52s)]
*  And then there used to be a sense of America, we are this country, we are these people, we are [[00:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=3593.8399999999997s)]
*  united, we are, we care about our neighbor. But that's been, a lot of that has gone by the wayside. [[00:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=3599.2799999999997s)]
*  We've become a, you know, I feel like our, our, our political leaders have sold us [[01:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=3611.8399999999997s)]
*  out to the highest bidder. I feel like it feels like, it doesn't feel anymore like your politicians [[01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=3620.64s)]
*  or your leaders have your best interest. It doesn't feel that way. And I'm not crying here. [[01:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=3630.64s)]
*  I'm just trying to, I'm trying to see how do we get to somebody that does something like that. [[01:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=3638.4s)]
*  That's what I've been thinking about. Like, how do you get there? How do you get to somebody [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=3642.48s)]
*  that does a shooting of a school? You know? Because you got to get there somehow. [[01:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=3647.84s)]
*  And it keeps happening. So anyway, I think that a lot of it is purpose. If you don't have a purpose, [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=3658.2400000000002s)]
*  then you are at the whim of whatever could come along. You're at the whim of whatever influence you, [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=3664.32s)]
*  you're at the whim of whatever influence you, whatever influence you get, [[01:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=3672.0s)]
*  or whatever ideology comes along that, that you can attach onto. [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=3676.56s)]
*  And so no job, no love, no real sense of honor or connection to your country. [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=3684.72s)]
*  So then, I mean, you're, and then on top of that, if you, if you find that you're the victim, [[01:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=3694.16s)]
*  if you start to say, I'm well, I'm a victim, you know, it's my, you know, everybody else, [[01:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=3700.0s)]
*  I don't have any responsibility for myself. It's all your fault. It's all your fault. [[01:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=3705.68s)]
*  Then you're going to find, not only are you going to find any ideology that comes along, [[01:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=3711.12s)]
*  which the internet is going to give the internet, it creates an algorithm that gives you whatever [[01:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=3715.36s)]
*  you keep looking at, you get more of. So if you look at pudding or something, you get all pudding, [[01:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=3720.16s)]
*  boy. And then three years from now, I'm wondering why you too, you can't be in the military now [[01:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=3726.08s)]
*  because buddy, you puddinged out, you chose pudding and pudding chose you. [[01:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=3732.56s)]
*  Cause whatever vice it is, it'll choose you back. So you, so if you, if you want to be someone who [[01:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=3739.2799999999997s)]
*  is, you know, you want to get involved with us like a alt right or alt left, [[01:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=3745.12s)]
*  or you want to get involved with school shooters or anti-Christian or anti, [[01:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=3750.64s)]
*  I'm just trying to think something, some severe ideology you want to get then the internet, [[01:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=3761.8399999999997s)]
*  the Twitter, whatever's going to keep serving you it. So now you, next thing you know, you're down [[01:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=3765.7599999999998s)]
*  a rabbit hole. And I think at that point, that's how you end up there. I think. [[01:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=3771.92s)]
*  You end up in a place where I'm going to, I'm going to be seen. I'm going to make sure they [[01:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=3780.8799999999997s)]
*  know who I am. I'm going to make sure that they say my name or they hear my name or they see me. [[01:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=3784.7999999999997s)]
*  And that's just, it's a, that's heartbreaking along the whole way. [[01:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=3797.7599999999998s)]
*  You know, so I don't know. I think I've just been having a lot of thoughts about that. [[01:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=3805.2799999999997s)]
*  How do people end up there? How do people get to a place where they would do that sort of thing? [[01:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=3808.0s)]
*  Now, some people I think are just crazy and those are crazy people. That's different. [[01:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=3814.56s)]
*  But how does someone who's just been, you know, [[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=3824.64s)]
*  because next thing you know, you're on Twitter, you get an anti-religious thing. You're like, oh, [[01:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=3828.32s)]
*  I went to a religious school. I also have trouble identifying in the world, maybe sexually. So [[01:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=3832.48s)]
*  man, I'm a victim. It's all, man, you really, and then your Twitter, your feed, your social [[01:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=3838.96s)]
*  media just keeps serving you more of that. Hey, you're right. You're right. You're right. [[01:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=3845.52s)]
*  And then, man, you're gassed up. [[01:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=3850.8s)]
*  So I think a lot of it is a sense of purpose, you know, [[01:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=3860.16s)]
*  and having a sense of purpose. And some of those sense of purpose is like the American one I can [[01:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=3863.04s)]
*  feel. I felt like when I was a child, it felt like, oh, we're part of this, you know, [[01:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=3868.96s)]
*  but it doesn't feel like that a lot anymore. [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=3875.44s)]
*  But also I got to recognize that I can still do things to try to be a part of this, you know, [[01:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=3883.6s)]
*  I can still do things to try and make myself have a purpose, you know, [[01:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=3891.04s)]
*  and you find purpose and, you know, I'm fortunate that people love me, my family, you know, [[01:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=3898.32s)]
*  you know, that I have a job, I have this podcast to come to. I have some sense of purpose for [[01:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=3905.2s)]
*  myself, you know, and a lot of you guys do too. I think we're kind of a purpose-filled group or [[01:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=3912.08s)]
*  we're trying to find that. But I think that's something that I feel like that's for me, [[01:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=3918.08s)]
*  that's something I think that that's part of that is that, man, when you don't have a purpose, [[01:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=3924.48s)]
*  the dark arts, well, they are at your door, they are waiting on the edge of your ear to come in [[01:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=3930.96s)]
*  and get your brain. And those include like, you know, all the just the link, just the rabbit hole [[01:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=3936.88s)]
*  you can go down and that'll make you hate. Because man, you find a rabbit hole. [[01:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=3945.04s)]
*  When you get halfway to the bottom of that bitch, there's a HOA meeting of just hateful [[01:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=3951.36s)]
*  owners association halfway through some of these rabbit holes. And it's just [[01:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=3957.44s)]
*  it's just dangerous. So anyway, let's hit some calls, huh? [[01:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=3966.48s)]
*  Hey, Mr. Vaughn. So lately, I have been coming home from work. And I like just to sit, [[01:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=3971.92s)]
*  I was outside inside, I like to grab a beer, and I just sit in silence, like not do nothing. [[01:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=3983.6800000000003s)]
*  But my wonderful girlfriend, whom I love very much. Oh, man, she talks, she talks so much. [[01:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=3990.96s)]
*  Oh, my God, dude. [[01:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=3998.0s)]
*  First of all, this I didn't believe you had a girlfriend. [[01:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=3999.44s)]
*  I was not expecting that part. That seemed like a [[01:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=4004.16s)]
*  surprise to all of us listeners, I would say that. But that doesn't mean anything. [[01:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=4008.56s)]
*  And what I'm trying to say is, yeah, if there's somebody that talks too much, dude, it's unreal. [[01:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=4014.7200000000003s)]
*  It's unreal. I have an early girlfriend that called me sometimes and said, I'm sorry, [[01:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=4021.2000000000003s)]
*  I have an early girlfriend that called me sometimes she talks, I don't need she talks. [[01:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=4027.04s)]
*  Oh, my God. If I even think about her calling, dude, I just get angry. [[01:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=4032.8s)]
*  That's how I get because I don't want to listen to her. [[01:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=4041.92s)]
*  I have people there's people I won't go spend time with it. They talk to me, their wife talks much. [[01:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=4048.8s)]
*  We're not friends anymore. We're not friends anymore. [[01:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=4054.4s)]
*  You know, you sometimes you got to put your put your spouse on a word count. I don't care who they [[01:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=4060.56s)]
*  are. You get 4000 words this spring. Do what you want with them. But when it's done, honey, it's done. [[01:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=4063.92s)]
*  And that's that. [[01:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=4075.2s)]
*  Get a little step thing for words. Oh, shit. Cindy got about seven prepositions left, boys. [[01:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=4075.92s)]
*  That's all she's got. And two nouns. Come on over. It's gonna be a quiet time. We about to enjoy the game. [[01:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=4086.48s)]
*  But yeah, I don't have a solution to it. You chose her. You chose someone's Europe. You're a [[01:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=4096.4s)]
*  lifelong listener, they call it. And you just a damn, you know, you a damn word pervert, boy. [[01:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=4102.16s)]
*  So you need to do something when she starts talking. Get that wiener out. [[01:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=4110.48s)]
*  You can start drinking your own spit, do something. And it could go the other way too. If you have a [[01:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=4116.48s)]
*  chatty husband, dude, I was somewhere the other day, we were in somewhere eating some meat and [[01:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=4122.4s)]
*  some guy wouldn't shut up. It was on you can't enjoy just you gotta shut up at times. And here I [[01:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=4127.44s)]
*  am talking into the second hour of a show. So what do I know? But let's see what else we got here. [[01:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=4138.639999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I need some advice. I'm down. My name is Zach. I'm down here in the bootie Louisiana area. [[01:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=4148.8s)]
*  Gang, baby. That's it. Booty, baby. I feel you right over there about airport about a big bridges, [[01:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=4160.08s)]
*  right over there near Laplace where your boy Billy Conforto used to live and die. [[01:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=4165.76s)]
*  And so weird shit been going on. I've been having two best friends [[01:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=4170.8s)]
*  forever. And I think they fell in love with each other and turned gay. And [[01:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=4180.4s)]
*  I just don't know how to handle it. They acting weird. [[01:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=4188.56s)]
*  Well, they're not acting weird, brother. They're gay. And [[01:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=4195.2s)]
*  they're being gay. And that's [[01:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=4200.32s)]
*  that's that's people are doing it. People are doing it. You couldn't. [[01:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=4206.88s)]
*  I mean, these days you throw a damn frisbee, it'll hit a gay dude. [[01:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=4213.84s)]
*  That's that's how popular it is. It's the new, [[01:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=4219.28s)]
*  you know, it's like doing the fries in the free chocolate, frizzy thing. That's [[01:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=4223.6s)]
*  when that came out. That same type of deal. But it's man, it's man doing it. [[01:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=4229.28s)]
*  Yeah, I don't know what you do. I think you'd be a supportive friend. [[01:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=4236.24s)]
*  Get them a trip, get them a little vacation or something. If you're down there and [[01:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=4240.0s)]
*  you know, I don't know. I don't know. What do you do? I mean, are you trying to see if they are in [[01:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=4244.0s)]
*  love or you because love? Here's the thing. Love ends up trumping everything. [[01:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=4248.64s)]
*  And even if it's gay love, [[01:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=4259.92s)]
*  gay love still ends in love. So now I don't know. I mean, yeah, I don't know what you do. [[01:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=4264.0s)]
*  I think you fucking DAPM up. But that's what's going on now. Every people are being gay, buddy. [[01:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=4274.56s)]
*  And you got it. If you I can't. But the odds you have two best friends and they fall in love [[01:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=4280.96s)]
*  with each other. And part of you is probably jealous a little. That's what's the craziest part. [[01:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=4286.320000000001s)]
*  Because I remember if I had two other friends growing up and if they even hung out together [[01:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=4293.92s)]
*  without me, bro, that shit made me mad, dude. It's like, oh, are you going to tell me fucking Terry [[01:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=4297.84s)]
*  and fucking Gerald? We're at the skating rink yesterday. And I'm at my house [[01:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=4307.6s)]
*  jumping through the ditch smoke because people was burning trash in the ditch by myself. [[01:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=4318.56s)]
*  Playing BLM out there in the smoke and they're having a fun time. It's tough. [[01:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=4328.0s)]
*  But do you willing to do gay to get all of the friendship? [[01:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=4337.84s)]
*  And that's where one of them said, hey, look, I'm about to secure the bag, dude. And he's talking [[01:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=4342.24s)]
*  about nuts, son. And that is gay men. Praise God, man. Thank you for sharing. And I think, [[01:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=4347.12s)]
*  yeah, you just got to be cool with them. Just chill, man. Let them do it. [[01:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=4354.4s)]
*  Let them do it and love them. All right. Let's take another one. [[01:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=4361.36s)]
*  Theo, my name is Jamie. I live in San Diego, California, and I just think something immediately [[01:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=4366.719999999999s)]
*  needs to be addressed. Oh, well, dang. Let's hear it. Jamie, onward. The president, Joe Biden. [[01:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=4372.96s)]
*  Okay. Okay. Look, I think this is one thing. Joe Biden, he's an old man. He has dementia. It is [[01:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=4381.6s)]
*  not cool to do this to an old man. That's what I feel like. I don't care what your political stance [[01:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=4394.88s)]
*  is. Your human stance. You know, my father was 70 when I was born. My father was an old man. So I [[01:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=4403.2s)]
*  grew up with an old man and watching them and watching them and understanding their presence [[01:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=4411.679999999999s)]
*  and their ability and their mobility, all of it. And we all know that this man is not suitable [[01:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=4421.36s)]
*  for what we have him doing or what people are pretending to have him do. Because at a certain [[01:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=4429.92s)]
*  point, there's no way this guy is making choices or making decisions. It's impossible. It's [[01:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=4434.96s)]
*  impossible. He's looking at things. He's ordering, you know, the other day he ordered an almond or [[01:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=4443.679999999999s)]
*  something off the top of a building. He doesn't know. He doesn't understand what's going on. [[01:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=4449.759999999999s)]
*  This dude's petting visible cats and damn sniffing children, dude. [[01:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=4454.4800000000005s)]
*  It's all just old people's stuff. He's not well. So at a certain point, we're the kind of country [[01:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=4459.2s)]
*  that says, not only this is what we do with our old, we take advantage of them to the point where [[01:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=4465.12s)]
*  we're even willing to let them be a shill, which I don't know what that is. It's something, [[01:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=4472.08s)]
*  it's like a false front or something for whatever else is going on. And I think that's pretty sick, [[01:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=4479.599999999999s)]
*  man. If you saw somebody doing this to an old person, you would think it was fucked up. [[01:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=4490.08s)]
*  That's what you would think. If somebody was doing this to you, if somebody was showing up [[01:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=4498.0s)]
*  at your grandfather's every afternoon and making him go in the front yard and say a bunch of shit, [[01:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=4501.759999999999s)]
*  and then making him go back inside, when they treating him up with ice cream or something, [[01:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=4507.68s)]
*  and they got, or whatever, child sniffs or whatever, they got a little bag of fucking [[01:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=4513.68s)]
*  nine-year-olds, barrette sniffing or whatever, I don't know. But you know good and well it [[01:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=4521.360000000001s)]
*  would be messed up. So I think it's fucked up by the [[01:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=4528.0s)]
*  all politicians, but also it's the Democratic Party. It's your candidate. You gotta know this [[01:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=4533.04s)]
*  isn't cool. It's just not cool. It's not cool to do to an old person. [[01:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=4542.48s)]
*  I don't know what you would, it's like senior trafficking. That's what y'all doing. Y'all [[01:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=4549.04s)]
*  senior trafficking that man. And I think it's messed up and it makes, it just reminds me, [[01:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=4554.24s)]
*  and I think this makes me angry because it reminds me of, you know, you would see people [[01:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=4559.44s)]
*  take advantage of old people sometimes. You know, I would see that with my dad sometimes. [[01:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=4565.04s)]
*  People would take advantage of him because of his age, or they would manipulate him or use him in [[01:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=4569.44s)]
*  ways that he didn't see because he wasn't able-minded enough to notice. And that shit made me angry. [[01:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=4573.839999999999s)]
*  And it's the same type of shit that these folks are doing on this more, [[01:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=4580.48s)]
*  on this national, international scale and level. You know, I don't know. I'm sorry to let that get [[01:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=4585.28s)]
*  me keyed up, but that's real to me, man. That's real stuff. Someone shouldn't take advantage of [[01:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=4592.32s)]
*  a senior citizen like that. It's messed up. It's messed up and we're acting like it's regal. [[01:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=4599.36s)]
*  Who the fuck are you kidding that this is a regal way to go about anything? [[01:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=4614.48s)]
*  What else do we have, Zach? Any other calls you recommend? Sorry, I'm, [[01:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=4626.16s)]
*  I might need an afternoon off. [[01:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=4629.759999999999s)]
*  There's just been a lot, man. You know, you go around, you have, there's just, [[01:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=4633.679999999999s)]
*  it's just a lot, baby boy. What else? Who's somebody that's having a tough time with something? [[01:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=4638.799999999999s)]
*  Hey, Theo. My name's Connor. I'm from Sacramento, California. [[01:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=4644.5599999999995s)]
*  What's up, Connor? Thank you for calling, man. Appreciate you. [[01:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=4652.719999999999s)]
*  I just want to first thank you for all that you do. You know, I don't know if you realize how much [[01:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=4656.32s)]
*  you do for a lot of people, you know, you, the way that you talk, you know, I relate with you so [[01:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=4663.839999999999s)]
*  much, even though we have such different backgrounds and upbringings and all that, but [[01:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=4669.76s)]
*  I really appreciate what you do. And, you know, recently in my life, I'm a new college student. [[01:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=4675.76s)]
*  Thank you, brother. I appreciate the nice words, man. It's very kind of you. Onward. [[01:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=4682.96s)]
*  You know, recently in my life, I'm a new college student, you know, starting my first year. So a [[01:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=4689.76s)]
*  lot is changing in my life. You know, my parents are splitting up, like the past couple months, [[01:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=4696.56s)]
*  and I broke up with my girlfriend recently, and it's just, in such a short amount of time, [[01:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=4703.360000000001s)]
*  my life has changed so much. And so I guess what I'm trying to say is, even when my life or just, [[01:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=4710.56s)]
*  you know, your life in general, changing so much, you know, I find, I find it hard to motivate [[01:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=4719.52s)]
*  myself to get out of this low sort of ebb that I'm in. So what I'm trying to say is, [[01:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=4726.16s)]
*  when your life is changing so much and it's throwing so much at you so quickly, like how do you, [[01:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=4733.28s)]
*  how do you stay motivated to really grow as a person, you know? Anyway, I hope. [[01:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=4738.88s)]
*  Thank you, brother. That's a, I appreciate the call. And it's funny, that's kind of how this [[01:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=4747.2s)]
*  episode started out. Yeah, I think for one, you got to find some moments of your own. You have to, [[01:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=4752.400000000001s)]
*  you have to take a step outside of things. You have to find time to do that, you know? [[01:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=4760.0s)]
*  And that means, you know, I got to, I got to limit myself better on my phone and what I'm in, [[01:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=4768.400000000001s)]
*  what I'm in taking, my attention, what I'm giving my attention to. [[01:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=4773.12s)]
*  You know, people, we don't even have imaginations anymore because we don't need it. The second [[01:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=4777.68s)]
*  my imagination used to start like this, your brain, you would have a moment of peace. You sit somewhere [[01:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=4782.96s)]
*  and then your brain would get bored. So your brain would start thinking of something or imagining [[01:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=4791.36s)]
*  something or creating something, right? Because imagination is just where creativity does bad in [[01:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=4797.28s)]
*  practice, right? That's it. And next thing you know, you would be imagining something and you [[01:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=4804.48s)]
*  would daydream or you would come up with a neat idea or you would come up with a dream or a goal [[01:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=4812.48s)]
*  or a realization, something that you needed to take care of that you hadn't. [[01:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=4821.04s)]
*  But that all happened because you had that open space, you had that time, you had that imagination. [[01:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=4825.84s)]
*  Imagination did that. Now, the second we get a little bit of free time, we go to something. [[01:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=4830.88s)]
*  We go to a phone, we go to a TikToks. You go to something, you do a vaping, you do a looking at a [[01:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=4836.16s)]
*  titty, you do a something. You do a something because you can't handle that uncertainty, [[01:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=4843.76s)]
*  what's next? What's next? But all that used to be next was imagination. [[01:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=4849.84s)]
*  And we don't have that anymore. We've replaced it with, let's just say, [[01:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=4860.8s)]
*  we're not going to have that anymore. We're going to have to replace it with imagination. [[01:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=4864.16s)]
*  And we don't have that anymore. We've replaced it with, let's just watch other, [[01:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=4869.04s)]
*  let's just watch others or let's find something to take up this moment. [[01:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=4876.5599999999995s)]
*  So I'm sorry, I don't even know where I trailed off there. What was I saying to this guy? [[01:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=4884.16s)]
*  Well, he was originally asking about staying motivated when life changes so much so fast. [[01:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=4887.76s)]
*  So you got to get that moment for yourself sometimes. You have to find it, right? [[01:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=4894.24s)]
*  Because yeah, that imagination would give you fun ideas. It would make your life fun, [[01:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=4901.76s)]
*  interesting. You'd be able to conceptualize. You'd be able to get a scope of your own life. [[01:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=4906.08s)]
*  So that kind of helped sort things. Now we're just always in the experiential mode. So we're [[01:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=4912.16s)]
*  not doing enough of the sorting to give us a good view of things. [[01:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=4918.96s)]
*  And when you don't have a view of things, that can lead to depression. You're like, [[01:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=4924.64s)]
*  oh, I don't know what I'm doing. Yeah, because I'm not giving myself time to know what I'm doing. [[01:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=4927.12s)]
*  I'm just doing. So sometimes you need a little bit more time to know what you're doing to [[01:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=4933.2s)]
*  get a look at things if things are too hectic. But yeah, I think to stay motivated, [[01:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=4939.04s)]
*  I think more than ever, we're at a time where you have to come to your own rescue. [[01:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=4948.0s)]
*  You know, the dark arts of algorithms and screens and attention seeking advertisement. [[01:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=4956.24s)]
*  You're depressed. Don't you want these fucking Cadbury eggs? That shit is at an all time high. [[01:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=4968.0s)]
*  And you got to see you have to sometimes you have to come to your own rescue. [[01:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=4977.68s)]
*  And that's the worst thing we want to hear. [[01:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=4983.36s)]
*  Because I want somebody to blame for how I'm how I'm how I'm feeling. I want somebody to blame. [[01:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=4987.36s)]
*  I don't want to buy. I don't want to have to put it on my, you know, [[01:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=4998.48s)]
*  you know, I don't want to have to put the cleats on me. [[01:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=5002.799999999999s)]
*  I just want to look at the shoe marks on me and blame them on say, oh, you know, [[01:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=5009.679999999999s)]
*  Deborah did that. Jonathan did, you know, but I don't want to have to get up and make my [[01:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=5014.719999999999s)]
*  own prints in the world. So I think some of it can be that, you know, parents do get divorced. [[01:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=5020.639999999999s)]
*  A lot of times when you get out of high school, they've been waiting to get divorced. [[01:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=5027.839999999999s)]
*  So as much as that can be tough on you, I think try and recognize what their lives have been like, [[01:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=5033.04s)]
*  maybe just hypothesin. But recognize that they might have held on for an extra three years [[01:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=5037.2s)]
*  because you were still in high school as a child. So I don't know, there's a lot there. But even if [[01:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=5044.08s)]
*  you have awareness, you're calling and thinking about what do I do? You know, how do I stay [[01:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=5051.28s)]
*  motivated? What was the last party asked about? What do you ask about that? [[01:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=5056.959999999999s)]
*  Just not being able to like waking up, not knowing the motivation. Yeah, it was, you know, [[01:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=5063.28s)]
*  parents got divorced, broke up with his girlfriend in college. Yeah. Yeah, you got a lot going on. [[01:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=5068.48s)]
*  So I think recognize that and give yourself a little bit of space. Yeah, you might not wake [[01:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=5077.44s)]
*  up with the with the with us since a purpose every day. But if you do start to develop one [[01:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=5081.12s)]
*  for yourself, man, it's going to be helpful. And you can here's something that I've learned [[01:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=5086.48s)]
*  recently from a fellow buddy of mine. And this is my buddy Thomas that used to own gray block pizza. [[01:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=5090.72s)]
*  And they were over there 1811 Pico Boulevard on the way to the beach gray block. Get that hitter. [[01:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=5096.96s)]
*  That was the original sponsor of this podcast. And he told me the other day. [[01:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=5104.400000000001s)]
*  He said, Hey, man, and they make the blue cube baths. Now he sold the one company [[01:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=5110.56s)]
*  and went from doing pizza pies to doing ice plunges. And he's a he's the fella that gave [[01:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=5114.96s)]
*  me that beautiful ice plunge at the house. That blue cube. But he said, Hey, man, you can each [[01:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=5120.4800000000005s)]
*  day when I wake up, I decided if the world is for me or if it's against me. And that's [[01:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=5128.24s)]
*  that's pretty powerful. Because right there, you're going to get a little bit of sense of purpose. [[01:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=5137.68s)]
*  But having a good sense of purpose is so key, man. [[01:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=5145.68s)]
*  And I believe the world is for you. I believe that the world is for us. [[01:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=5151.52s)]
*  I really do. I think that there's predators out there. [[01:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=5157.92s)]
*  You know, there's dirty lungs out there with damn trumpets. Time the trumpets to their mouths. [[01:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=5162.64s)]
*  But that don't mean that we can't fight baby. That's what I'm saying. [[01:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=5169.84s)]
*  And I think having a sense of purpose is key, man. And is the world for me or against me? [[01:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=5174.64s)]
*  Because if I say the world's against me, then that's how my day is going to go. [[01:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=5181.28s)]
*  This world is against me. But if I say, man, the world is for me, the world wants me to do well, [[01:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=5185.52s)]
*  the world wants me to do better. The world wants me to see something else. [[01:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=5192.08s)]
*  The world wants me to do well, the world wants me to do better. The world wants me to see someone [[01:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=5196.16s)]
*  and smile at them. The world wants me to let someone go if they do something wrong. Not real, [[01:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=5200.8s)]
*  like look, not crazy. If they do something, they get your shit, get their shit, [[01:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=5206.4s)]
*  you know, or go get your shit back. That's what I mean. But yeah, the world is, it's for me. So [[01:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=5210.8s)]
*  anyway, I believe that the world is for you. I believe that and every day you might not succeed [[01:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=5220.08s)]
*  in some way, but over time you can. I believe that you can. So I just pray that you have some [[01:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=5224.88s)]
*  sense of purpose, man. I pray that I do too. Every day I don't, but more often than not, [[01:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=5230.72s)]
*  I feel like I do. And I'm grateful for that. But if you're struggling, man, if you're going [[01:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=5236.56s)]
*  through something, man, just don't feel like you're alone. There's people thinking about you. [[01:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=5242.64s)]
*  There's people you can't even see or feel in the distance that care about you. [[01:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=5246.88s)]
*  So let's get out of here the way we came in. Sorry, this is alone, but I hadn't been, [[01:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=5255.68s)]
*  gotten to spend time with you guys in a little while. And this was important to me. I'm going [[01:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=5259.52s)]
*  to take a week off at some point in the coming weeks. And so I'm going to start to figure that [[01:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=5264.88s)]
*  out. But you guys be good to yourselves, baby. Let's go out the way we came in on Eddie Nine Vault, [[01:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=5269.36s)]
*  Little Black Flies. [[01:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYiQxHM0L-w&t=5275.36s)]
