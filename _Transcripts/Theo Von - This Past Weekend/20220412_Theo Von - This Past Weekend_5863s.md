*  today's guest, Mr. Kyle Dunnigan. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=76.24s)]
*  Dude, remember my fight idea we haven't done yet? [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=106.24s)]
*  What was it? Were we gonna fight? No. Who would win? I'm fast. I would win. You're stronger, [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=116.8s)]
*  but I'm faster for sure. I'm also, I can get down low and come up huge. Like I get low and. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=124.16s)]
*  Like, what do you mean? Like one of those like, like, like one of those lizards that like does [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=130.88s)]
*  that big trick. Yeah. I have a very long torso and I can just suddenly you'll be like, how do you [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=135.2s)]
*  get way down there and then pop up huge? I would win. You'd be surprised. I. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=139.51999999999998s)]
*  There's two parts of me that wants, you know, one that wants to [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=148.88s)]
*  figure it out a little. When we hugged a little while ago, I felt like I would win in a fight. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=154.16s)]
*  I mean, I don't know if soft muscles is a real thing, bro. Is that? Yeah. Like wagyu beef. Oh, [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=160.39999999999998s)]
*  yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I felt that way. Yeah. I definitely felt a sort of, uh, [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=171.6s)]
*  definitely something that had been caged, you know? Yes. Yes. Well, you're wrong. Okay. Um, [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=179.35999999999999s)]
*  I'm very dense actually. Really? Yeah. Just genetically I have a dense muscle structure. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=185.52s)]
*  Have you had your marrow tested or not? Yeah. Dense marrow. Have you, have you had your marrow [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=191.76000000000002s)]
*  tested? Yeah, man. Oh, that's miserable, huh? Why'd you have it tested? I think I was having [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=196.4s)]
*  some chronic type of thing and so they tested it, but that kind of stuff's miserable. Yeah. I [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=203.44s)]
*  have this thing called them a liar. I never had it tested. Do you ever get punched in the face? [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=210.4s)]
*  Yeah. Can you take a punch or do you sort of get your bell rung? You're lost. It hurts, [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=215.52s)]
*  but it also depends on how I am. If I'm ready for it, um, I think I can kind of do okay. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=222.16000000000003s)]
*  I have no idea. Like I might have an iron chin or just paper. I have no idea. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=228.48000000000002s)]
*  I'm curious. And there's only one way to find out. You know, you never know until you get [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=233.84s)]
*  punched. What's that? I'm sorry. Yes. Should I get earplugs? No. Our idea was we were going [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=237.36s)]
*  to match up celebs, be celebs and do our own pay-per-view kind of thing. Well, you saw that [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=245.2s)]
*  Aaron Carter's fought Lamar Odom. I didn't see that. Did that already happen or it's going to [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=252.79999999999998s)]
*  happen? It already happened. Let's bring up a clip of that if we can. Let's go to the clips. Um, [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=258.71999999999997s)]
*  but there's this big money in this and then me and you, we commentate on it, whatever, [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=263.84s)]
*  we bring our expertise to the table. Oh, I like it. Who would be a good match? That's what we're [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=268.08s)]
*  talking about. Cause we have comedians like, you know, they have little fights, kind of like [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=273.36s)]
*  rappers or whatever. You just go, you sort of preamble with a fight and then you sort of [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=276.88s)]
*  announce they're going to actually physically fight. Yeah. And you can just keep it on mute. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=282.0s)]
*  Let's see if we're good at being commentators as we do this. There comes Lamar Odom into the ring. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=288.96000000000004s)]
*  Now he's and, Oh, and there's Aaron Carter. Look at him. He's kind of bouncing. Oh, there's a height [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=294.08000000000004s)]
*  difference. It's intense. This reach is just not fair. Well, you see Carter, there is nipple high [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=299.2s)]
*  on that brother. He actually is fighting a man who was in the hospital. Uh, didn't he have a conco... [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=304.24s)]
*  He went into some kind of coma, right? Both these guys have overdosed. Come on. This is not fair. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=310.47999999999996s)]
*  And there's a, Oh, and they hug at the end. That's like when you hug me, he feels this soft man. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=317.68s)]
*  So obviously they must've showed the highlight there. Are there any highlights from that bout? [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=324.4s)]
*  That seems like an awful fight if that was the highlight. Lamar got the nod there. Um, [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=330.08s)]
*  who would be a good match? I think maybe what about machine gun Kelly versus Kelly Slater? [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=336.24s)]
*  Oh, that'd be cool to just match names. Yeah. Like that. Or versus Megan Kelly. Oh yeah. And I think [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=341.12s)]
*  Megan Kelly might win. They both have the same body style. Yeah. I did her show last week, which [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=347.76s)]
*  I never thought I would do her show, but when someone just asked me, I always just say yes, [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=352.48s)]
*  that's my policy. Oh wow. Um, and then she did this thing per very nice, but when people try to [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=356.4s)]
*  improvise, you know, it's, it's not easy. She doesn't like it or what happened? No, she, they [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=364.15999999999997s)]
*  didn't do this thing, which is, of course this is what she would do, but she's, she'd be like, what [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=369.2s)]
*  is, uh, Jeff Goldblum think of the war in Ukraine? So you have to sit there and on this, on the fly, [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=372.23999999999995s)]
*  right? Like Jeff Goldblum monologue about the Ukraine. That's funny. I mean, it's like an [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=380.15999999999997s)]
*  impossible, you're supposed to give something they call it. Yes. And when you improvise, [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=383.52s)]
*  you'll be like, Hey, I saw you at the burger place. You, uh, had that giant cat with you. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=388.48s)]
*  Yeah. I've given you something. Yes. And he, the cat has malaria. Yeah. You've added yes. And yeah. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=395.04s)]
*  But you don't, you don't ask an open ended question. How do I know this? The groundlings. Yeah. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=401.92s)]
*  I went to two classes. It sucks. I went to two classes there and the teacher was a native [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=408.0s)]
*  American woman. I remember Karen. Yeah. I had Karen. Yeah. I'm a mama. Yeah. Yeah. Pretty cool, [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=412.56s)]
*  man. They're nice, but that place, because who's more from the earth than the, or actual groundlings [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=420.56s)]
*  and native Americans and the name ground. You think that's all tied together? I wouldn't be [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=425.68s)]
*  shocked. I mean, it, it, I wasn't shocked when I got there and it's like, this is the groundlings [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=430.4s)]
*  and your teachers, native American. It was like it for me, it made perfect sense. I thought, [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=434.32s)]
*  but it was my first experience. I feel like right when you get into Hollywood, everybody goes to the [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=439.91999999999996s)]
*  ground. Yeah. It seems like that's your way onto SNL or something, but then you get there and then [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=443.91999999999996s)]
*  they don't even pay. These shows are sold out every night. They're sold out. They don't even [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=448.56s)]
*  give you gas money. Yeah. Give me $5. It's the sold out theater. Yeah. That's really, I don't know why [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=453.52s)]
*  they don't revolt there. It could tell a Judaic at a certain point. It really gets a little like, [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=459.52s)]
*  uh, yeah, they just take, yeah, there's not. Yeah. No giving. Give a little bit of gas money. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=464.0s)]
*  I think what, um, I was going to open a place next door called, like I wanted to become a [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=470.16s)]
*  multi-billionaire and just open the Skylings next door and pay everybody like a hundred thousand [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=475.2s)]
*  dollars a week and just take all their talent. Like what now? And if, if the Skylings, if people [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=480.16s)]
*  airlifted into it and people came, uh, there was no parking. You just landed on the roof. You had to [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=486.72s)]
*  get everyone is a helicopter to be expensive. Well, I'm a billionaire. Dude, what happened to [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=491.68s)]
*  COVID bro? Well, it's in China now. Last I heard it. What it's in China now, but how can a disease [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=499.04s)]
*  that is everybody has it or can get it just be only at certain spots. That's what I don't understand. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=507.2s)]
*  Like was malaria like picky choosy like that? I honestly have, I'm the worst person. I have no [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=513.04s)]
*  information. I don't understand any of it. I don't know. I know this variance peeled off or [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=520.24s)]
*  something. I had it once. I don't know which one I had. I think I had the Delta thing or something. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=525.36s)]
*  Wasn't that, wasn't that bad for me? But yeah, it's just weird how it disappeared. Yeah. And it's [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=530.08s)]
*  funny because in the 19, what is it? 19, I'm doing Trump hands in like 1919 or whatever, when they [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=537.92s)]
*  had the other one. Terrific. They had that one took like two years. It doesn't matter. Like how [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=543.6800000000001s)]
*  much you have in terms of technology or what we've gained knowledge, it still needs two years to get [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=549.04s)]
*  out of here. Yeah. Yeah. It had a great PR run. Whatever it had a great publicist, the whole thing. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=555.12s)]
*  It felt kind of masterful, but it does feel, I mean, it feels like now that it's completed, [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=562.3199999999999s)]
*  it feels way more like a lot more of a facade than it really was if it could just disappear. Right? [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=566.7199999999999s)]
*  Well, I'm again, don't listen to me, but I think what happens is, you know, it mutates and it gets [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=573.12s)]
*  weaker as it, it seems to get weaker as it mutates. And so that's what happened. I know a guy, he was [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=579.0400000000001s)]
*  in my house and he died early on. And I, it was like right away, this is here and a guy and he was [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=584.24s)]
*  dead. And so I, I immediately was terrified of it. Oh wow. You know, when he was 50 years old, [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=590.0s)]
*  he was an old guy. And was he thick? Was he smoking? Was he doing dope? No, he was pretty straight, [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=594.88s)]
*  narrow guy. And he worked near like a smoke stack or anything. Like, was there any like [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=601.44s)]
*  far away from smoke stacks? He wasn't, didn't seem sickly. Oh, um, he was, he was in that band, uh, [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=605.52s)]
*  you know, Stacey's mom, that guy, Adam Schlesinger. Yeah. And he was in my house, like a couple of [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=613.44s)]
*  months before that. And he was just dead all of a sudden. So I was wiping down my tuna can of tuna. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=619.6800000000001s)]
*  We were at the grocery store and just wiped it down. I was really paranoid in the beginning. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=626.24s)]
*  You never gave, you never feared it. I mean, I was just, at first I didn't understand it, [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=629.92s)]
*  but then once I had friends that people started dying, I was like, something's going on here. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=635.04s)]
*  But I just felt like the best course was probably just to let it run, let it go. I don't know if all [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=640.9599999999999s)]
*  the stuff, it just felt, always felt very bizarre to me. And then how you, how I could be in Tennessee [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=647.1999999999999s)]
*  and it's wide open and you come here and you're like, Oh my God, it's like a slave planet here. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=653.6800000000001s)]
*  And then the numbers weren't that much worse. Although I will say, I guess when you're in a city, [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=660.0s)]
*  it is going to spread easier because you're more packed as millions, millions of people packed [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=664.8000000000001s)]
*  together. So I guess that makes kind of sense. It would be more in the cities, but it didn't seem [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=668.8000000000001s)]
*  like it was, um, no place was really spared really. Yeah. Well, it just didn't seem like it, how, [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=673.9200000000001s)]
*  like how would they let me fly from one place where people are just rampant? I know it's still [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=680.64s)]
*  like that. You go places like put a mask on, you're like, all right. And then you sit down, [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=684.64s)]
*  like you can take your mask off some airlines, you gotta like, like lower your thing to chew [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=687.92s)]
*  and then put it back up when you're done chewing. And then other airlines are like, [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=692.08s)]
*  we don't give a fuck here at Delta or whatever it is. I kind of like that. The up and down, [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=694.72s)]
*  that part I kind of like a little bit. You have a little more privacy on the plane. And as long [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=699.92s)]
*  as you get a snack, you get, it's definitely makes you feel more like a, like a, somebody that's [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=703.36s)]
*  grazing though. You know, you're like, oh, if I get some food, then I'll be fine. You know, [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=709.44s)]
*  see, here's why I don't like it. And this is like just self-centered stuff. I look, [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=713.6s)]
*  some people look better with a mask on, but, but like, this is my month. This is my money zone. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=718.24s)]
*  This is where I look really good. Oh yeah. You do have like kind of like an, like teeth, [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=722.96s)]
*  strong lips and everything else kind of falls apart, but this is where I bring it back, [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=726.8800000000001s)]
*  you know, so I can be like a five or I don't know what number I am, but no, you're not a five, bro. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=731.2s)]
*  I think it's nice to say I'm a five. What you are way more, you are better than a five, man. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=736.8s)]
*  I've seen fives, man. And also most people are a five. Yeah. I feel like I'm, [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=744.16s)]
*  so you're better than that. I appreciate that, but I think I'm probably pretty average looks wise. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=750.0799999999999s)]
*  It's hard to say. I think if you go for a good run, right? You have maybe a couple, you challenge [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=756.3199999999999s)]
*  yourself with some, maybe even a spicy food or something or, you know, uh, you know, I see you [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=763.28s)]
*  eating a steak or something. You're an eight just by eating a, just by the whatever. If you go for [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=769.52s)]
*  a good run, you show up sweaty. You kind of like that John Kousaki sort of, I'm funny. You have [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=775.76s)]
*  pretty good clothes. They give good shoes and stuff, which I think brings up a little bit. Like I [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=780.8s)]
*  gotta, I think Mike, my clothes game brings me down with I maybe wore nicer stuff. It might help. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=784.8s)]
*  I think you seem like the guy in like the beginning of a movie before he's going to like get it all [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=791.36s)]
*  together. Okay. I just downloaded an exercise app this morning. Was it fitbot? No, it was fit coach. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=795.84s)]
*  Oh, there's some new ones out. Yeah. But yeah, I got these boots, man. These Roojo boots and they're [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=802.64s)]
*  nice. You know, this is ostrich. Is that right? Yeah. Ostrich. Yeah. Are they bumpy like that? [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=807.04s)]
*  Oh yeah. Is that just what their feathers come out or something? Yeah. Cause the feathers come out. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=814.96s)]
*  And the crazy thing is I believe that they send you also the feathers with, so it's almost like a. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=818.24s)]
*  Wait, what do you mean you believe? Didn't you get them? Yeah, but I did. There was like a separate [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=824.5600000000001s)]
*  little package with each one that I didn't open up, but someone said that there's some company [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=828.16s)]
*  that sends you the feathers also with the boots. I don't want that. I don't know. It's kind of like, [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=831.92s)]
*  at least you're taking, it's almost like the guy that kills the animal and uses it all. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=837.6800000000001s)]
*  You know, it's like it. That's why you like use these feathers. I think if they do that, [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=841.6800000000001s)]
*  I kind of like the concept of a company saying, okay, you want this leather belt. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=847.44s)]
*  Here's also the hoofs. Here's the horns. Here's the, you know what I'm saying? Like [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=851.44s)]
*  put a responsibility on the person who's going to wear. Okay. Okay. So then you can say, yes, [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=856.5600000000001s)]
*  I wear leather, but I use the entire animal. Yes. Yes. You know, I have a wallet made out of a, [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=865.9200000000001s)]
*  you know, you know, duck bladder or whatever goat bladder. I have, you know, you know, I have this [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=872.08s)]
*  little weed carrying case made out of like a hollowed out horn or something. Like I just feel [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=879.36s)]
*  like then if you did that, then you, they can't Trump you by saying, oh, you're, you're, you're [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=883.2s)]
*  where that's a, that's a really interesting thought. And like a carton of eggs comes with beaks. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=888.0s)]
*  Yeah. Like there's room in that carton to just stuff like the, [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=892.88s)]
*  you could stack 12 beaks right on there for, you know, I don't know. Actually, I do know. I think [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=895.9200000000001s)]
*  they can have a ton of eggs, man. So it could just be one beak. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=900.4799999999999s)]
*  How do you feel about different colored eggs? Like, do you feel like, are one healthier? I feel [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=903.8399999999999s)]
*  like the all white eggs aren't healthy. Is that just, I just make that up. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=907.76s)]
*  I mean, I will say that in the brown cartons, there's a little more crime. If you know what [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=912.0799999999999s)]
*  I'm saying, bro, I will say that. But I mean, I'm just, I don't know this, you know, people [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=916.88s)]
*  graffiti a lot of shit, but what I'm saying is that the, uh, the white ones do look a little [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=922.0s)]
*  bit more like they kind of put them together as opposed to they were actually hatched. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=927.6s)]
*  If you get that hatched batch, you have bring up hatched eggs, please. Fresh hatched. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=933.2s)]
*  Right there. And there we go. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=941.6s)]
*  Yeah. That's, oh yeah. That's gross. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=947.52s)]
*  Yeah. If you can look at that, if you can look at that, you can see, uh, and some of them even [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=951.12s)]
*  have some green ones. Yeah, they get, they get really funky. Yeah. It's almost like the colors [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=957.04s)]
*  of tic tacs. That's they're based on. Um, what percentage of, do you think there was some though, [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=963.28s)]
*  like a lot of fear created by the media around COVID? Oh, no doubt. Yeah. I mean, they grab onto [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=971.68s)]
*  something and they just run it and run it over and over again. It just saying something over [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=980.0799999999999s)]
*  and over again. Yeah. Uh, is, is just, it just worms into your brain. You know, they just go, [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=984.48s)]
*  okay, we'll do this for 10 minutes. That's what happens. I don't watch them. You know, [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=992.08s)]
*  I just stop watching. I think a lot of people, their ratings are way down. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=995.12s)]
*  It's horrible. Yeah. I think Fox news has the best ratings I know, but I don't know. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=998.96s)]
*  It's all, I mean, it's just, I don't know. I don't watch it. Who even goes to their television, [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=1004.24s)]
*  like at a certain time to see, so you know what I'm saying? Like I don't even think that happens [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=1008.48s)]
*  anymore. But you know, what did happen was they just found some alien stuff. Um, they just [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=1013.2s)]
*  declassified a bunch of aliens. Is this true? I heard that they're getting people pregnant. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=1018.48s)]
*  Was that the thing it said? Um, I don't know. Can you bring that up? I don't believe in aliens, [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=1022.48s)]
*  really, but, uh, not really because I just, what bothers me is if you're going to go across the [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=1028.64s)]
*  galaxy, it's very large distances. Okay. When you get there, you're just going to hide. I just feel [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=1034.24s)]
*  like you'd want to be like, we're here. You know, can you just imagine their beings like us? I mean, [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=1040.96s)]
*  they're creatures of the universe. And if you're traveling this far, why are you hiding? And then [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=1047.68s)]
*  what weird experiments are you doing? Right. It doesn't seem to add up to a logical. Well, [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=1056.16s)]
*  I think they used to do the experiments when they were trying to figure out what was going on, [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=1062.0s)]
*  if there was anything happening here. To me, I think it's almost like you ever have somebody [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=1065.52s)]
*  take you to one of those, uh, local zoos, you know, the drive-in parks, a drive-in zoo. No, [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=1069.76s)]
*  you ever had that? No. In Robert, Louisiana, we used to have this place called, um, [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=1075.84s)]
*  I think it was Larry's zoo or something. Larry's post-s, uh, Larry's. Yeah. One Larry, but, [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=1080.64s)]
*  and they had all types of animals there, you know, and they say it's all types, but it's like a mule [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=1091.6s)]
*  and they would like paint, you know, paint, do stripes on it or diet skin, you know, to zebra. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=1097.04s)]
*  But they would have at least one giraffe. They'd have one, uh, antelope, you know, [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=1102.56s)]
*  they'd have a couple animals that were, they'd have like a big, big cat or something in a cage [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=1107.84s)]
*  and like keep it far away where you couldn't get close to it, but they would say it was like a [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=1112.72s)]
*  dangerous animal. Oh, would you, they were saying they would paint them so they would be like other [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=1115.76s)]
*  animals? Just zebra. Zebra was the only one that ever, they ever did that. I went to the circus [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=1119.52s)]
*  once they had a goat and they said, they said, come see the first living unicorn. And this, [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=1123.44s)]
*  as a, from a child, they just put the goats things. They kept tying them together. So it's really, [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=1128.0800000000002s)]
*  it was goat, two goat horns. They spun together over like years. We went to one thing in a [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=1132.3200000000002s)]
*  middle school and this monkey starts, uh, pledging himself. It was like a window and everyone starts [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=1138.3200000000002s)]
*  laughing and, ah, and then he climaxes and everyone goes, wow, like that. And then, and he's looking, [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=1144.0s)]
*  you know, monkey looking in the eye. He takes it, puts it in his mouth. So it went from like, [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=1151.76s)]
*  ha ha to, ah, to like, ah, and then the teacher tried to get everybody out of there. When you're [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=1157.12s)]
*  in eighth grade, that's the funniest thing you can possibly say. And did he swallow you think, [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=1163.76s)]
*  or did ever at that point, everybody was out, you're probably like locked in. Yeah, it was [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=1167.6s)]
*  probably like are now a pin. He gave it a taste. Yeah. He wasn't, did it look like it was the first [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=1171.76s)]
*  time he'd done it or did it look like he had done? This is a practice. It looked like a first time [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=1177.44s)]
*  he saw everyone's reaction to the fact that he jizzed and then he was like, what else? He was [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=1183.52s)]
*  just, he felt the bug, like the performing bug. And he's like Charlie, that was crazy. [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=1189.2s)]
*  Yeah, dude, that's insane, man. I remember, uh, and I've told this story before and R.I.P. this one [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=1197.52s)]
*  fella that I grew up with. Um, we were in a hot tub, right? When I was a child, somebody had a [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=1204.24s)]
*  birthday party. Yeah. And everybody was excited. Nobody had had a hot tub. So people are over there [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=1210.48s)]
*  and Louisiana is Dane, you know, it's insane. The whole state is hot tub. So it's insane to get a [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=1217.1200000000001s)]
*  hot. It's like, it's already hot and wet. Oh, well, yeah, it's just like, you know, somebody's doing [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=1223.04s)]
*  a crawfish boil in one part of the yard and they're literally boiling and then you're sitting in a hot [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=1228.48s)]
*  in a nut. It's just the whole, it's already, it's a hot tub of a state. So anyway, we all go over [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=1232.88s)]
*  there. It's going to be a sleepover and, uh, and there's just one fella who'd been ejaculating. [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=1239.92s)]
*  Nobody knew in the hot tub. No, no, no. Oh, just on his own time. And nobody knew it, right? He [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=1245.68s)]
*  nobody, he hadn't said anything and maybe he might've hung out with older people. He was a rodeo boy. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=1252.88s)]
*  Wait a minute. I'm confused. He masturbated on his own time. [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=1257.9199999999998s)]

*  So what happened next was this. So we're all in the hot tub. Everybody's, you know, [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=1274.56s)]
*  kind of just joking around, talking about baseball, maybe singing hat or, you know, [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=1278.6399999999999s)]
*  ribbing this one fella about his birthday. And that fella ended up dying years later, [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=1282.8s)]
*  but this one fella named CJ, he's under the water and he's been pleasuring himself. Right. [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=1287.68s)]
*  And none of us know we'd never even seen it. How old are you? Huh? You're probably 10 maybe. And [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=1295.44s)]
*  he was maybe 13 or 14. He'd been held back a couple of times. Oh God. And I remember he even had a, [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=1301.28s)]
*  he was, he was like, he had shorts on and a belt buckle, which is fucking insane. Right. He was [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=1306.08s)]
*  like a real rodeo boy. Well, anyway, he pulls his wiener out and he, he brings it out of the water, [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=1310.8s)]
*  like just like lock nests in it, right? Right out the water and just starts spraying into this hot [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=1316.6399999999999s)]
*  tub. And we didn't know what was going on. Right. So this one fella named Will, you know, God bless [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=1322.0s)]
*  him, man. God bless his soul. He grabs onto it cause he didn't know if something was happening to him. [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=1327.44s)]
*  Like his body was leaking out of himself. Like he was going to, it was going to keep going until [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=1332.6399999999999s)]
*  it was nothing left him. He had put tourniquet on it. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Like tie it off. [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=1336.64s)]
*  So he just grabs it to stop it. Right. And the kid punched him in the neck so hard, dude, that it was [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=1341.68s)]
*  just, it was so many immediate things at once. And it was just like, well, he really grabbed his [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=1350.48s)]
*  cox to help him. He was saying like, let me stop this. To save him. Yeah. It's like, if you saw [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=1356.96s)]
*  somebody bleeding or somebody got, you know, somebody macheted somebody and you had to help [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=1361.68s)]
*  them. And how confusing you're trying to help someone. They punch you in the neck. And we, oh, [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=1366.3200000000002s)]
*  and what none of us knew what was going on. What a crazy, like, I don't know. Was it 13 seconds? It [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=1370.0s)]
*  was probably a very fast thing. It was insane though to just have that much go on. And then [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=1375.2s)]
*  you're all just in this hot water and then there's semen in there. There's just, oh God. And you don't [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=1380.8s)]
*  even know what it is, dude. Oh, we had no idea, bro. You're just touching it. Like, what is that? [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=1386.24s)]
*  You got out. Oh, people didn't know if it was like liquid ghost or what it was, you know, [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=1390.8s)]
*  people were shocked. I remember this people just like, you know, mouth open people, like someone [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=1396.08s)]
*  guy got, he couldn't even move. Was there, you know, like tag him. Like he got into a game of [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=1402.56s)]
*  freeze tag. He didn't even know. Like just with like, just like, the shock of it all. Yeah. [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=1407.44s)]
*  Was there consequences for this 13 year old pervert? Not at that time. I'm sure I think [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=1412.32s)]
*  at that point people were afraid. Nobody wanted to rat the guy out. So he went totally unsubmerged, [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=1420.24s)]
*  masturbated, submerged and then came out of the water. Oh no, he was just sitting there. We're all [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=1426.72s)]
*  chatting. Oh, so he's like wanking. But he's in there. Yeah. Oh my God. So he could have been [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=1430.48s)]
*  homosexual as well. You know what I'm saying? It's all boys there, but he was also a boy. If he was [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=1435.1200000000001s)]
*  a man, it would have been way weird. But since he was a boy, I think it keeps him out of that, [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=1439.1200000000001s)]
*  that pedophile. It's always interesting. Like the ages where the government has to cut off, [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=1444.16s)]

*  Republican? Why are there two teams? I'm sure there's a reason that I understand, but [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=3182.16s)]
*  can't we just have a guy and then have people that like have issues, issue to issue? [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=3186.64s)]
*  I think what we used to have that. What's that? What is that? That's what politics used to be. [[00:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=3193.12s)]
*  Like everybody kind of had a guy, but you kind of supported whoever the president was. [[00:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=3197.8399999999997s)]
*  And then I think, I don't know what that is. That kind of changed. It's really interesting. I don't [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=3202.96s)]
*  know. I don't know if it was just so much of like the power of social media and the media, like [[00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=3207.52s)]
*  pitting us against each other with like different clips. Cause that's what really does it. [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=3211.92s)]
*  That people see a clip and then they, that's that they latch onto it. [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=3216.08s)]
*  But even before the media, there was Democrat Republicans who are like, you're this or that. [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=3220.0s)]
*  And then like you have pressure to stay with your team. Like there should be any of that. It should [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=3225.12s)]
*  be just like also the way we elect the president should be, I would like to change the rules of [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=3228.96s)]
*  that. Yeah. Well, I think a lot of it's kind of archaic, you know, it's old news. They're doing [[00:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=3235.84s)]
*  shit like, you know, 13 original colonies kind of stuff. They need to evolve it a little bit. [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=3240.8s)]
*  We should big brother the presidents. Like you get people, first you like a sort of a [[00:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=3246.96s)]
*  intelligence test, then you do like a psychology test. Then you do, you know, [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=3253.28s)]
*  vet them completely, all this stuff. And then you put them all together for like a month. [[00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=3257.6800000000003s)]
*  And we just watched them survive and go, this guy brilliant. He can handle pressure. That guy. [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=3261.36s)]
*  Yeah. That's what we do. Have Julie Chan interview. I'm like once every two weeks. [[00:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=3268.48s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. Check in. I mean, to be a successful politician, you have to, you have to lie. You [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=3272.2400000000002s)]
*  have to be a liar. Right. Yeah. But you get to know who people are. When you see them for an [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=3277.76s)]
*  extended period of time, you start to be like, oh, this guy's like that. This guy's like that. [[00:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=3283.52s)]
*  And in tough situations. I mean, same thing with a bachelor. The bachelor should not be them on [[00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=3289.36s)]
*  vacation. It should be them like having to do their taxes or like just them in some, in a closet [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=3293.36s)]
*  for a while or they can't shower late for a flight or there's only cold water this week. [[00:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=3298.8s)]
*  This challenges you're late for a flight. That's really good. There was this one of those [[00:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=3303.84s)]

*  They get off this gondola and they're like, let's explore like fucking idiots the wrong way. [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=3320.56s)]
*  So they get on the wrong side of the mountain. The gondola leaves without them. They can't find [[00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=3325.44s)]
*  their way back to the gondola. Now they're just like trenching through just vast wilderness. Okay. [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=3330.0s)]
*  And who's leading? Does it say a man or woman? It's a man trying to be a man. Okay. And she's [[00:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=3335.52s)]
*  there. And then she says she wakes up in the morning and she doesn't want her breath to be bad. [[00:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=3341.2s)]
*  You know, their, their lives are in danger. If you're still trying, you're on this date still. [[00:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=3345.2799999999997s)]
*  Oh, that's true. The date is still going on. Yeah. It's like maybe we get rescued and like, [[00:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=3348.64s)]
*  I don't have bad breath and gross smell like shit. So now they just like, they finally find this like [[00:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=3352.7999999999997s)]
*  tent. They run to it like a tent. Maybe there's a hiker and there's just a skeleton. They're like, [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=3360.08s)]
*  like a dead guy. Okay. And he's a experienced climber guy and he's got a journal and the [[00:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=3365.44s)]

*  No, that's how mad they were and annoyed because you need you to survive. They were like, [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=3384.3999999999996s)]
*  go over there. I hate you. And that was a TV show. This is a real, the show was like, [[00:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=3390.08s)]

*  all the vegans come running. What's going on? You killed these trees. That's the toughest job [[00:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=3479.28s)]
*  being a firefighter. Like when these fires happen and they have to go in there and then it can [[00:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=3485.84s)]
*  blow your direction. You're just engulfed. You're sucking in that soot all day. Yeah. They drop [[00:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=3491.0400000000004s)]

*  water comes out and it kind of just sprays out, put them all in giant water balloons. Then it [[00:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=3501.92s)]
*  explodes on the ground. Is that a good idea? I think it's a great idea. Or one giant water balloon [[00:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=3508.48s)]
*  it splashes on the water. Sort of a mist because a mist hits the water that hits the fire. Yeah. [[00:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=3514.32s)]
*  It's interesting, man. It's interesting to see how to know which one would be what, you know, [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=3520.4s)]
*  that's real interesting. Brilliant though. That guy just started a forest fire. Yeah. And simple. [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=3526.48s)]
*  And they probably build it for it. The worst part though, he's probably still paying for it. [[00:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=3532.16s)]
*  He's still paying for that day. He's in jail. God. Yeah. I guess you gotta let him off a hook. [[00:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=3535.28s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. Do you see, we had a question that came in. Let's get back to that question. Back [[00:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=3540.8s)]
*  to the questions. I, oh, okay. Here's a lady. Oh, there she is. Beautiful young lady. Hi, Kyle. I am [[00:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=3546.88s)]
*  one of your biggest fans. I'm seriously obsessed with you. You're amazing. Such a brilliant comedic [[00:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=3555.84s)]
*  mind. And thank you. That's just the flattery portion. But I do have a question, which is, [[00:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=3563.92s)]
*  I'm curious about how you construct your sketches because they always feel, [[00:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=3571.28s)]
*  you know, these like outlandish concepts, but they never feel like too cartoonish. And I don't know [[00:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=3576.48s)]
*  how you do that with some of these, some of these characters that you create. But I'm curious because [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=3583.04s)]
*  I do feel like you have mastered the sort of language of subtlety in your comedy, as well as [[00:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=3590.24s)]
*  being really over the top. And I was curious, like, how do you know when the sketch is complete? [[00:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=3594.4799999999996s)]
*  Because I feel like there is an art to that. And it seems like you are really good at knowing sort [[01:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=3601.2799999999997s)]
*  of how long it needs to be and when the joke has sort of run its course. So yeah. Thank you. There [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=3607.7599999999998s)]
*  you go. And then is there any way to answer this about sounding like a total douchebag? [[01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=3615.52s)]
*  I don't know. Like analyzing your comedy so it's hard to win. It is. And we can't even take this out [[01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=3620.48s)]
*  if it's not. Oh, no, that's a sweet question. It's a very sweet question. And she seems very sweet. I [[01:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=3625.92s)]
*  yeah. Well, I'll tell you that the one thing I do do, which I don't do do, that I don't think [[01:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=3633.92s)]
*  other people can because I shoot so cheaply. Yeah. I will like shoot something, I have an idea and [[01:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=3640.96s)]
*  shoot it like raw and like bad and I'll sleep on it and I'll watch it the next day and be like, oh, [[01:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=3647.44s)]
*  that doesn't need to be like that. And I have like a fresh thought. I also ask if I'm having [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=3654.32s)]
*  trouble with something. This helps with a lot of things now is you sort of like give it to your [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=3658.96s)]
*  subconscious to figure out and go to bed. I think a lot of, you know, because you really, [[01:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=3666.56s)]
*  your ideas kind of pop into your conscious. Like it does come from your subconscious, you know, [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=3674.08s)]
*  the thoughts. Yeah. Your brain's really a great thing. We forget that. Yeah. And just let it run. [[01:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=3678.56s)]
*  I think like trying to intellectualize things. I don't really get good stuff out of that. It's [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=3684.08s)]
*  usually the, not as creative stuff. And then in terms of, I edit way down, I try to take [[01:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=3688.16s)]
*  anything not needed. Sketch takes a lot of time. I take a lot of time, like something that would [[01:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=3696.3199999999997s)]
*  take me like 15 hours or when I do the fresh press, do these like eight minute shorts, [[01:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=3703.6s)]
*  those take like over a hundred hours of editing and whatever rework. And you like to do it all [[01:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=3709.7599999999998s)]

*  that moment where you look down and your body stops climbing? That's what I want to know. This is the [[01:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=4278.16s)]
*  variables involved in your scenario are, are there's a huge gap. I mean, there's so many variables [[01:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=4284.24s)]

*  thread. Okay. Is it a rocky terrain? Is no, you're just on a ladder, a ladder. You're a steel ladder. [[01:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=4331.4400000000005s)]
*  I would say maybe like a mile, like probably get a mile up without making it ring. No, dude. I don't [[01:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=4341.360000000001s)]

*  Look how fast I'm not even moving my head. You just gotta move your limbs quickly. Would you be [[01:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=4365.360000000001s)]
*  scared you would hit your head on one of the rungs and that would ring it? Would you climb with your [[01:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=4372.160000000001s)]
*  face out to the side? I would probably bring it back a little, tuck the chin. I got a, I got a thing [[01:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=4375.84s)]
*  like that would really blow your mind. I'd put the bell in my mouth. If it's like dangling a couple [[01:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=4381.92s)]
*  inches, I'm going all the way. But then you have one little breathing mishap or this or that and [[01:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=4387.68s)]

*  I just feel really uncomfortable just going up to a stranger. It's just weird to go up to a stranger. [[01:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=4408.56s)]
*  It's weird. But that's all getting married is, is just going up to a stranger. That you've known for a while. [[01:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=4412.4800000000005s)]

*  office. And then you, then you hook up one night and you've known each other for six months and [[01:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=4430.96s)]
*  that's good. Yeah. Then you get married. Yeah. Not this nonsense we do. And then also they've seen [[01:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=4434.8s)]
*  your perform. That's a weird. Yeah. Have you ever sent like a DM to a celebrity or just to a woman? [[01:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=4440.72s)]
*  DM'd. I've DM'd, but I don't think out of the blue, like, hey, I saw your pictures. I've never done [[01:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=4449.360000000001s)]
*  that. Yeah. I've done like, hey, I saw you somewhere. Like as a lie, you'll say that? No, [[01:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=4456.24s)]
*  then I really did see them somewhere. Oh, okay. Yeah. But they didn't write back. Oh, [[01:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=4462.96s)]
*  maybe they didn't see it. I saw it. You're a catch dude. You got all, you got everything going for [[01:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=4466.4800000000005s)]
*  you. I really think that. Well, that's nice of you, man. I think you do 81. You bet one of us isn't a [[01:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=4471.92s)]
*  fucking woman, dude. Dude, we'd be fucking, dude. Are you kidding me? Dude, we'd be in a relationship [[01:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=4476.400000000001s)]
*  long term. We'd be fucking right here, dog. You'd meet my mom, dude. Yeah, dude. She'd tie little [[01:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=4484.0s)]
*  strings around me and keep me in a room like this. My mom would love you. Dude, I get so worried [[01:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=4490.8s)]
*  about just where the world's heading. Are you worried about it? Yes and no. I feel like I've had [[01:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=4496.88s)]
*  such a good run. I'm kind of like, okay. Do you know what I mean? Right. But I'm talking about the [[01:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=4503.2s)]
*  next gen, next two gens. Yeah. Like I feel bad, but I kind of don't care about, I kind of don't care. [[01:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=4508.08s)]
*  I probably if I thought about it, I wouldn't care, but I don't think about it at all. [[01:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=4514.08s)]
*  I mean, it's funny how the news puts something in front of you to care about. Every night there's [[01:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=4517.6s)]
*  a billion children that go to, billion people go to bed hungry. Yeah. You know, but then we decide [[01:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=4521.36s)]
*  like this is a march for this or this now the Ukraine thing, all very important stuff, but it's [[01:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=4527.28s)]
*  like there's always, there's never a march for starving children. There's never, there's always [[01:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=4531.76s)]
*  some horrible things happen. It kind of numbs you out. Like what are we doing? What is CNN telling me [[01:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=4536.96s)]
*  I need to be worried about today? Cause there's horror everywhere, which is the horror we're going [[01:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=4541.6s)]
*  to focus on now. It was like, you know, black lives matter for a while. Then it went to COVID [[01:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=4546.0s)]
*  and now it's on Ukraine. And it's like, okay, there's going to be a next thing. People are [[01:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=4550.96s)]
*  getting burnt out of it. I think. Do you think that Ukraine or COVID all of the whole thing, [[01:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=4554.56s)]
*  like, Hey, this news, fear the value of getting all this information is. [[01:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=4558.72s)]
*  We don't care. We don't care, but at the same time we are addicted to it. So that's the tough [[01:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=4566.88s)]
*  part. Well, that's the thing where people you get on a team, you feel like it's part of your [[01:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=4573.6s)]
*  identity. You're like, you know, you know, I'm part of this cause, which is good. You know, it's all [[01:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=4576.64s)]
*  like good stuff to help problems, but shouldn't like the number one cause every day be like [[01:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=4581.4400000000005s)]
*  there's starving children dying. Like that should be our number one top story. Then we'll go, [[01:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=4586.72s)]
*  okay, it's other thing, but we're, you know, that's not how it is. Yeah. Okay. And I wonder, [[01:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=4591.120000000001s)]
*  like people don't even care about things like Santa that much or anything. No one cares about [[01:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=4596.4800000000005s)]
*  Santa anymore. No one talks about him. Isn't that crazy? Yeah. Like he's Matt comes and gets [[01:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=4599.76s)]
*  everywhere with presents. Yeah. Are you worried about the future? Yes. I would assume since you [[01:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=4604.72s)]
*  asked that question, you're worried about it. Yeah, I guess I am. I'm just worried about, [[01:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=4609.84s)]
*  it used to feel really neat to be human and I don't know if we as a society value it enough [[01:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=4614.56s)]
*  more than the people in or the people in control value it enough as much as they value [[01:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=4626.56s)]
*  like power and money. Well, and so they're willing to sacrifice everything. [[01:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=4631.360000000001s)]
*  They're willing to let it really whittle away. You know, I think the underlying problem to all that [[01:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=4636.240000000001s)]
*  is, is we don't face death. It doesn't, it sounds incongruous. It doesn't seem like that tracks, [[01:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=4641.76s)]
*  but the fact that we are the first species where we know we're going to die. Like, of course you [[01:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=4652.4s)]
*  have to put that species on medication. Like if you just went to another planet and like, here's [[01:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=4660.16s)]
*  a species that just found out they'd have to be very religious and it's just too psychologically [[01:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=4663.5199999999995s)]
*  upsetting. And then you, you have this energy, you're pushing that down. You got to focus it [[01:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=4669.28s)]
*  on something else. Like we do cultures like ours that idolize celebrity are generally the most [[01:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=4674.48s)]
*  unhappy, you know, and it's generally the most, they most push away death. I mean, those two things [[01:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=4681.759999999999s)]
*  are equally correlated. There's other cultures that they bring the dead out and then it's a whole [[01:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=4686.4s)]
*  thing for a long time. And they're, they're less stressed out in general and they don't like [[01:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=4690.879999999999s)]
*  understand, you know, celebrities much or revere it. It's kind of like an immortal thing. We think [[01:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=4696.5599999999995s)]
*  about celebrities. It's like this way of like, see, we live forever and everything's so incredibly [[01:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=4701.44s)]
*  temporary. Yeah. We don't really rat. We don't really tap into the reality of it. We create this [[01:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=4707.679999999999s)]
*  kind of pseudo reality that of life through celebrity or like of longevity through celebrities. [[01:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=4714.08s)]
*  Is that what you're saying? Yeah. I, I, I, I'm kind of torn because it's also like, yeah, we should [[01:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=4722.24s)]
*  distract ourselves. It's such a, I don't know, go back and forth. Yeah. It's really, you're on a [[01:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=4726.4s)]
*  roller coaster and then you're like told at the end is a brick wall and you don't know when it's [[01:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=4731.679999999999s)]
*  going to come and have an enjoy yourself. Yeah. I was like, that's like kind of where we're having [[01:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=4736.08s)]
*  to deal with. And so we're on pills. Yeah. And watch. Do you think that, um, [[01:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=4740.5599999999995s)]
*  Oh, I was going to ask you this. Oh, this is what I thought about aliens visiting the [[01:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=4748.96s)]
*  planet. I thought that aliens just come by. It's almost like when your mom's like, I'm going to [[01:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=4753.28s)]
*  take you to the, um, I'm going to take you to the, the local zoo or whatever, you know? Yeah. And [[01:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=4758.48s)]
*  alien kids are like, fuck mom, I don't want to go to that dump. You know? And it's like some, [[01:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=4766.24s)]
*  sometimes there's still people going over to see earth. It's like, they're so advanced, but every [[01:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=4770.16s)]
*  now and then like some shitty family brings their kids over like, well, well look, every, you know, [[01:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=4775.28s)]
*  Mars is full, you know, they got a line over at Neptune. You know, dad couldn't get tickets [[01:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=4780.72s)]
*  to Saturn. So we're going to run them over here. Way better than those. Right. I agree. But I think [[01:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=4784.88s)]
*  in, in, in, in alien world, they're solar system. Right. So they're like, oh, fuck mom, we got to [[01:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=4790.16s)]
*  go all the way over to earth and we drive all the way there. And the parents are like, or fly, you [[01:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=4796.72s)]
*  know, in their, in their flying drive, you know, driver. And then they get there and like, oh, [[01:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=4801.6s)]

*  Yeah. This guy doesn't, you know, this guy hates Santa. Like it's all like this guy over here is [[01:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=4817.4400000000005s)]
*  uncle Albert. Like mom, this place is a fucking dump. You know, we got to get the F out of here, [[01:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=4822.16s)]
*  mom. All right, we'll leave. Let me at least burn this lady's womb over here. Just to fucking let [[01:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=4829.04s)]
*  them know we were here. And then they send out one little torch flame and they jet. I've seen the [[01:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=4835.04s)]
*  tic-tac videos and the, and I don't know what it is. And I definitely know I don't have all the [[01:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=4840.56s)]
*  answers. Here's what I think it is. Okay. I think it's a multi-dimensional thing. Things popping in [[01:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=4846.16s)]
*  my guests, not like people visiting. Cause it's just so far away. Right. That it, and then not to [[01:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=4852.4s)]
*  contact. It seems like more of like an anomaly because you know, there, there's a lot of evidence [[01:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=4858.08s)]
*  that there's like a multi-dimensions, right? Like, you don't know where gravity, there's a lot of [[01:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=4864.8s)]
*  gravity missing that they're like, maybe that's folded into dimensions or something. Yeah. I [[01:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=4868.88s)]
*  don't know anything about this, but I'm just going to believe that. No, man. Look, I think you're [[01:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=4873.04s)]

*  one. The database includes more than 1500 pages, UFO related material. I am. Do you believe they [[01:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=5075.6s)]
*  ever found something and hit it? That's, I'm just going to ask you a point blank. I don't want to [[01:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=5082.0s)]
*  beat around the bush anymore. All right. No, I don't. I think they found some military like advanced [[01:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=5084.96s)]
*  stuff, but I don't know. I would say this is a guess. I don't know. I just don't think it's likely [[01:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=5091.52s)]
*  that a spacecraft made of material flew, you know, at least four and a half light years closest solar [[01:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=5097.2s)]
*  system, which we're not getting any radio signals from that. We're not getting any radio signals [[01:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=5106.64s)]
*  from anything in our view. Okay. So it has to travel hundreds of light years, which I mean, [[01:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=5111.28s)]
*  you take, you shoot a light at the laser at the moon. It takes like a second to get second and [[01:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=5118.32s)]
*  a half to get there. Right. It took us, I don't know, like a week to get there going 18,000 miles [[01:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=5125.76s)]
*  an hour. Yeah. Now for a hundred years, go that fast. And then you finally get to, and you can't [[01:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=5130.4800000000005s)]
*  even go that fast because your mass will be infinite. So you have to go close to it. That's [[01:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=5137.68s)]
*  why I think it's jumping through wormholes or something else. Right. Okay. So you're saying [[01:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=5142.16s)]
*  there's some, uh, the distance, if you really get it, there's some tectonic synesthesia going on. [[01:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=5146.72s)]
*  Exactly. Just some interstellar tectonic interstellar tectonic. You're a smart guy, man. Um, [[01:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=5151.76s)]
*  I wonder if we covered everything. Was there any other good question that came in for Kyle? [[01:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=5157.679999999999s)]

*  Um, or do you have someone else that you would rather lampoon? Um, yeah, that's my question. [[01:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=5197.36s)]
*  Gang gang. Gang gang, man. Could you imagine if Trump and Biden went head to head again? Could [[01:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=5206.5599999999995s)]

*  yeah. It's a very real question. Will he live? I mean, I've never been more concerned about [[01:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=5219.5199999999995s)]
*  the health of a president. Unbelievable. He doesn't even seem like a well grandfather. [[01:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=5223.5199999999995s)]
*  Yeah. He'd be worried about grandpa. Like I've had grandfathers that seem kind of well, [[01:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=5228.96s)]
*  you know, like he doesn't seem that like that right now. Yeah. Biden does not seem well. [[01:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=5234.48s)]

*  So if, but what are they going to do? Not have him run again? That's what they would do probably. [[01:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=5251.4400000000005s)]
*  And then I've never heard the president, a president make this sound during a speech. [[01:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=5255.52s)]
*  What if Biden dies off? Will you have a funeral for you? The character, what will you do? [[01:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRkzoWKNlIs&t=5262.4800000000005s)]
