*  Budgetary things this and that casting we have to agree on so I rarely I never gone into it like this where it's just me [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zs1X92HVRO0&t=1653.74s)]
*  And you and that's good. There's some some tough part about but it's overall the best because [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zs1X92HVRO0&t=1660.14s)]
*  We put it up we're going in [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zs1X92HVRO0&t=1666.9s)]
*  It's such a complicated process though [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zs1X92HVRO0&t=1668.98s)]
*  Almost too much because usually there's someone that cover this and you can kind of oversee it [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zs1X92HVRO0&t=1670.98s)]
*  but to get into everything about pre-production and budget and [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zs1X92HVRO0&t=1675.3400000000001s)]
*  Casting and locations and all the union stuff. We got to know that's where it gets hard. And now we've gotten to the hard part [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zs1X92HVRO0&t=1679.3400000000001s)]
*  We got it. We shot it through the fires through all the stuff [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zs1X92HVRO0&t=1686.3200000000002s)]
*  very tough very tough to get through a movie and then [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zs1X92HVRO0&t=1690.06s)]
*  There was so many things that were tough. I always say after movie. I'm not doing this again [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zs1X92HVRO0&t=1693.8200000000002s)]
*  It's too hard and everyone thinks I'm you know, huge pussy, but it's more it's mentally tough. It's hard [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zs1X92HVRO0&t=1697.5s)]
*  You got to memorize stuff. You're driving all day. You're getting out there dark and it's such a luxury to do a movie that [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zs1X92HVRO0&t=1701.9s)]
*  You can't complain to anyone you I can complain to you, but we we're in it together [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zs1X92HVRO0&t=1709.3s)]
*  So we get it but and you can tell other people movies, but regular people go [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zs1X92HVRO0&t=1713.78s)]
*  You know they actually bust their ass right so we're we're like pretending to be people that work hard [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zs1X92HVRO0&t=1721.3s)]
*  That's our that's us in a movie. So we're bus boys [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zs1X92HVRO0&t=1727.1599999999999s)]
*  So anyway, you have to give you just long enough to polish the gun that you have in your trailer [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zs1X92HVRO0&t=1730.4799999999998s)]
*  And then before you can use it on yourself. Yeah, like hey, we need you back on. Yeah, it's always like where are they? [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zs1X92HVRO0&t=1734.7199999999998s)]
*  I'm walking with number two or here's number one. Yeah, I go for a walk. They just follow me [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zs1X92HVRO0&t=1739.9199999999998s)]
*  Yeah, they walk out of your set, you know, you walk around the trailer and you're like [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zs1X92HVRO0&t=1744.6799999999998s)]
*  And you're always miked and you're always it's all you know, and it's fucking freezing. I thought it'd be too hot [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zs1X92HVRO0&t=1747.8799999999999s)]
*  So anyway, we finish it and now it's rough-cutted and now [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zs1X92HVRO0&t=1753.64s)]
*  The hard part is just getting it to a point [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zs1X92HVRO0&t=1758.4s)]
*  Where we think it's good and you're not wasting jokes [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zs1X92HVRO0&t=1762.52s)]
*  Yeah [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zs1X92HVRO0&t=1765.3200000000002s)]
*  like a lot of things we did had like Theo is very good on the set of we're actually good together because I [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zs1X92HVRO0&t=1765.8000000000002s)]
*  Think you're great [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zs1X92HVRO0&t=1771.8000000000002s)]
*  And if we have a scene and we do it then we just start goofing around a couple before we leave [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zs1X92HVRO0&t=1772.68s)]
*  Get a few extra jokes and so which one of those do we use? [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zs1X92HVRO0&t=1777.5600000000002s)]
*  It's very hard to this is funny for one reason this is funny for another and the rest of your life people will remember [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zs1X92HVRO0&t=1781.16s)]
*  One joke and they'll never see the other three and you go fuck [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zs1X92HVRO0&t=1786.4s)]
*  Do we pick the right one for that that for someone who's indecisive like me and you are kind of too that [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zs1X92HVRO0&t=1789.5600000000002s)]
*  It's hard to do and then yeah, you just got to pick one lock it down [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zs1X92HVRO0&t=1795.2s)]
*  And then we'll probably I think our next step will show it to like [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zs1X92HVRO0&t=1799.4s)]
*  20-30 people because you really get a feel [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zs1X92HVRO0&t=1803.0s)]
*  For where there's a dead spot where there's something that works [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zs1X92HVRO0&t=1806.44s)]
*  Yeah, you could have honest friends look at it [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zs1X92HVRO0&t=1809.16s)]
*  Yeah [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zs1X92HVRO0&t=1811.3200000000002s)]
*  And I have friends and and friends are always gonna start by saying they like it and then but I haven't had fucking one person [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zs1X92HVRO0&t=1811.8000000000002s)]
*  Look at it yet. I'm saying I'm too scared. I [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zs1X92HVRO0&t=1817.3200000000002s)]

*  Yeah, and then that'll tell us a lot will be like, oh my god [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zs1X92HVRO0&t=1848.92s)]
*  This is way funnier than we thought they're laughing at this stuff instead of that laugh [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zs1X92HVRO0&t=1851.8400000000001s)]
*  I didn't see that coming like a cutaway and then they go [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zs1X92HVRO0&t=1855.5600000000002s)]

*  I mean black sheep was sort of the next summer and it was sort of [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zs1X92HVRO0&t=2505.82s)]
*  The same type of movie we had we should have just kept it Pete Siegel and just done it again [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zs1X92HVRO0&t=2511.46s)]
*  He couldn't he wasn't available. It just would have kept track of like kind of how it was but I did like black sheep [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zs1X92HVRO0&t=2517.86s)]
*  We had another movie that we were talking about at the very end and would have been great [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zs1X92HVRO0&t=2524.7s)]
*  Yeah, I mean would I have liked to have like a run-and-gun buddy to goof around he would have been all over the place [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zs1X92HVRO0&t=2530.32s)]
*  He would have been working with everybody. I mean [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zs1X92HVRO0&t=2536.92s)]
*  even at that point toward the end because you know, he's almost more famous now because everyone looks back and but when you're in it and [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zs1X92HVRO0&t=2539.36s)]
*  He's just getting famous but still all the big hosts that would come in would like go right to him [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zs1X92HVRO0&t=2546.0800000000004s)]

*  He would have done a lot of stuff with Adam, I mean he loved Adam and always thought he was great so [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zs1X92HVRO0&t=2557.82s)]
*  Sandler you yeah. Yeah, he was very tight with Adam and I was just lucky to be in a couple with him [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zs1X92HVRO0&t=2563.54s)]
*  But he would have been out there doing everything. I remember when he was in coneheads [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zs1X92HVRO0&t=2569.2000000000003s)]
*  we all were in cone even Adam was in coneheads and Lauren it was sort of a an [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zs1X92HVRO0&t=2572.82s)]

*  Ellen and [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zs1X92HVRO0&t=2585.14s)]
*  Somehow still didn't work that well, but I loved being in it and he was in and he had a pretty big part [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zs1X92HVRO0&t=2586.46s)]
*  He was funny. Look at him. There he is. Oh, he looks so handsome. Did you get to keep the cone from that? [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zs1X92HVRO0&t=2592.3799999999997s)]
*  No, but you know what? It's it that will barely fit up your butt. If you oh [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zs1X92HVRO0&t=2597.2599999999998s)]
*  She's really pretty by the way that we have Michelle Burke [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zs1X92HVRO0&t=2604.22s)]
*  This is after they took a photo of Farley and they take it so strong that he it blows his hair back or something [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zs1X92HVRO0&t=2608.02s)]
*  Yeah, that's funny shit but accurate yeah, so that was a blast so I would say the answer is [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zs1X92HVRO0&t=2614.06s)]
*  Would have loved to keep doing stuff and just have them around to hang out with yeah [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zs1X92HVRO0&t=2619.66s)]
*  Yeah, obviously to have him be alive, but do you think that you would have been able to do a Tommy? [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zs1X92HVRO0&t=2624.14s)]
*  Yes, and these all these scenarios he's alive [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zs1X92HVRO0&t=2628.62s)]
*  You know, I can be great no if he's alive [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zs1X92HVRO0&t=2632.62s)]
*  You have to add that caveat and what if you had to do Tommy boy to what what would the plot even have gone? [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zs1X92HVRO0&t=2634.66s)]
*  Into you think Tommy boy to electric boogaloo, you know there I was pitched a Tommy boy to which was our [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zs1X92HVRO0&t=2639.46s)]
*  Kids are together and our kids are but this is I was pitched it two years ago [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zs1X92HVRO0&t=2646.9s)]
*  And I'm like, I just can't find a scenario with no farley [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zs1X92HVRO0&t=2651.7s)]
*  It's not they used the whole movie even if it has a good title Tommy boys in the title [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zs1X92HVRO0&t=2657.06s)]
*  But it would be too much of a sellout. I can't imagine I mean [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zs1X92HVRO0&t=2663.02s)]
*  No one could do that we're thinking to do it with CGR use one of his brothers to do it you know [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zs1X92HVRO0&t=2666.5s)]
*  It was just like it was his it was our kids and it was about them [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zs1X92HVRO0&t=2670.5800000000004s)]

*  You know, yeah [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zs1X92HVRO0&t=2690.38s)]
