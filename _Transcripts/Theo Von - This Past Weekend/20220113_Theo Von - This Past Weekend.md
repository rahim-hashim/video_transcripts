*  About doing breath work. Yeah, and I didn't know anything about it and so I was like well, what is it? [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=135.94s)]
*  You know mm-hmm, so what is it? [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=142.3s)]
*  Okay, uh well, yeah, I started breath work sort of at the beginning of the pandemic [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=145.62s)]
*  I just love I love learning and like a really curious person and I took a few classes and sort of my mind was blown [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=150.94s)]
*  And then later on I I took a course a certification course just because I wanted to learn more about it [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=160.18s)]
*  I never ever thought I would teach it or use it or anything [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=167.29999999999998s)]
*  But basically it's like holotropic breathing and [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=170.16000000000003s)]
*  Holotropic yeah, and it's like can you move your mic down just a little bit so it's not a freer face [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=176.08s)]
*  Yeah, okay. Is that better? Can you see yours? Okay? Okay? [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=180.64000000000001s)]
*  and it's like a two-part it's a two-part technique as you know through the mouth and [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=184.4s)]
*  You breathe deeply into the belly and then a chest breath on top and then you know easy exhale [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=190.60000000000002s)]
*  Okay, so I go so it's inhale through the mouth. Yeah all through the mouth nothing through the nose, okay? [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=197.85999999999999s)]
*  so stomach and then chest [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=205.57999999999998s)]
*  Did exhale yeah? Yeah, and then you just try to keep a rhythm through the whole thing and it just um [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=208.57999999999998s)]
*  You know it alkalizes your blood in a different way [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=215.78s)]
*  Then you're used to and all sorts of crazy shit happens [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=221.45999999999998s)]
*  So do you know what happens because the first time that we did it you and I did it yesterday [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=225.57999999999998s)]
*  We've done three sessions. Yeah, and [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=230.34s)]
*  And thank you for that. It's been really interesting. Yeah, dog [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=232.5s)]
*  the [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=236.82s)]
*  Yesterday yeah my hands everything gets real hard right like I can't even like move my hands it almost feels like I'm [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=238.38s)]
*  Like if you see a dead body or something yeah, they call it lobster claws [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=247.78s)]
*  It's tetany and it's just because you know there's a different amount of co2 in your blood than usual [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=251.9s)]
*  Yeah, you pull that up from your usual [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=260.3s)]
*  Breathing okay. Yeah, so it's a big difference in how much co2 is in your body than your regular state of breathing [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=264.44s)]
*  And so your hands go like that, but it's not nothing is wrong with that [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=270.38s)]
*  There's nothing that's gonna happen and is it poisonous because we used to sleep at my buddy Jeff's house, and they had a [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=274.5s)]
*  Co2 leak I guess in his house or something and we would sleep for like literally 36 hours [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=281.22s)]
*  I'm glad you're still alive. Yeah. Um yeah. Yeah, definitely. He's alive also [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=288.22s)]
*  That's really good, but I as that's that that's is that co2 is that [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=293.74s)]
*  No, that's I mean that's an external co2 gas [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=299.5s)]
*  This is just [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=303.78s)]
*  Produced within your body so you're safe [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=305.02s)]
*  But you know like if it is it is sometimes a sign that you're going too hard like you're being too forceful [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=307.53999999999996s)]
*  Especially on the exhale like if you get too much of the tetany yeah, yeah, okay [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=314.82s)]
*  So let's bring it up. I just want to be able to see what it is just some there you go [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=320.02s)]
*  If you have experienced cosmic breath work you may have experienced tetany tetany is characterized by cramping tightening tingling [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=324.5s)]
*  Paralyzing or numbing sensations of the hands and or feet and even the face oh wow so yeah [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=332.24s)]
*  I do remember now my face got and my neck started to feel a little bit like hard and tight [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=338.04s)]
*  Yeah, if this does occur during cosmic breath work note that it is very common and should not be feared, but what's happening? [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=342.22s)]
*  What's causing it? It's just like a dramatic increases of co2 into your butt [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=348.6s)]
*  But I don't mind it like when I'm doing breath work. I just know I kind of like it because I know it's working [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=353.48s)]
*  It's sort of like when you're at the gym. Yeah, and you know you feel like Botox like a little yeah [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=359.4s)]
*  I mean what I just what I love about it [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=365.47999999999996s)]
*  I just didn't even know that your body could feel these ways or that you could get to this stage just from [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=368.35999999999996s)]
*  Breathing right like I feel high after like I don't know [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=374.56s)]
*  Well, I don't know how many drugs you've done, but like it feels high like it's really good. Yeah, I've done it [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=379.44s)]
*  Almost I haven't done cry I've never I have never done crack. I was honest. I always wanted to smoke crack, but um [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=386.64s)]
*  I've never wanted to but who knows but I've never smoked crack before but um [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=393.0s)]
*  Some of my buddies had but I've never gotten into it [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=398.32s)]
*  But anyway, yes, so so yeah cuz I didn't realize that so your butt yeah, I did feel after yesterday [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=402.64s)]
*  I felt really high. I just felt really like I [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=407.56s)]
*  I [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=411.2s)]
*  Don't know what I felt like I definitely felt altered like in an altered state yeah, and the first time I did it [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=412.44s)]
*  I mean, I just like it. I don't know what happened [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=418.71999999999997s)]
*  That was different the first time but it literally like I was at the end like ball it like just like [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=422.71999999999997s)]
*  There was such a release of like I don't know. What is that? What happens? [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=428.28s)]
*  Well Colin and I were talking about it before and he was saying he cries every time and it's like [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=433.15999999999997s)]
*  You can go into a session feeling great, and then it'll unlock something just like the energy [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=439.8s)]
*  whatever you know hurt or [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=446.96s)]
*  Pain is in your body that you're not even aware of your conscious mind [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=450.16s)]
*  So I cry a lot of times when I do it, and it's just like every time. I'm so surprised [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=454.84000000000003s)]
*  It's crazy. Yeah, I heard the first time I did it [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=461.16s)]
*  I yeah [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=463.72s)]
*  I was like and then I had to go to breakfast after with somebody and so I was like and I kept moving them [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=464.44s)]
*  Brackets back like 15 minutes. I'm literally sitting in my hotel room like and I just like I just couldn't help [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=469.52s)]
*  But it's had all these feelings and everything was so like raw it just felt like it's like raw meat [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=475.59999999999997s)]
*  Totally you know yeah, and then I had to go on Jocko willing [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=481.0s)]
*  Who's like a Navy SEAL guy to do his podcast that day? [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=484.4s)]
*  And I walk in there like the complete opposite of a Navy SEAL yeah, I was like I was oh [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=487.08s)]
*  It was very it was a tough day to be in front of like the toughest guys [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=495.04s)]
*  I think I told you that they'll like expect to be really raw after I mean sometimes the sessions aren't that deep like [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=499.56s)]
*  I'll have one and I'll be like really wanting to have some yeah like [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=506.24s)]
*  Excavating experience, and it's just not that but then sometimes it really fucking hits you yeah, it blew my mind [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=511.84000000000003s)]
*  I didn't know that something like that could happen. I didn't know [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=518.92s)]
*  I just shocked me. I didn't know that that that much of you could have that much of a release [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=522.6s)]
*  Yeah, I didn't know it either. I was stunned what what led you to even want to learn about it. Oh [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=528.56s)]
*  Well one. I'm just a really curious person. I love trying new things [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=535.2s)]
*  especially [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=541.28s)]
*  you know with my body or [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=542.8s)]
*  spirituality or [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=546.08s)]
*  You know [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=547.52s)]
*  Healing or wellness as I get older I take a lot better care of myself [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=548.6800000000001s)]
*  especially with comedy and traveling so much and [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=553.6s)]
*  everything [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=556.6800000000001s)]
*  But yeah, I started reading a book [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=558.08s)]
*  It's a famous one called the body keeps score and it's basically the premise is about how trauma is stored in our bodies and [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=560.44s)]
*  So when I kept getting recommended breath work because you bypass your conscious mind like I've been in talk therapy forever [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=568.32s)]
*  Yeah, so it's not good a lot of times well [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=576.3199999999999s)]
*  It's just like you're a lot of times you're not getting like you can talk about things without feeling anything oh [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=578.8s)]
*  Interesting yeah, and the feeling part is what? [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=585.92s)]
*  Makes you able to pass through something I agree. I need to have the feelings about things [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=589.3199999999999s)]
*  So it's like when someone's giving me information that never helps me [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=594.36s)]
*  It's like my therapist where I work best with therapists that are able to like trick me into having a moment where I have a feeling [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=597.4399999999999s)]

*  Well, I think the act of comedy itself is extremely masculine thing [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=1344.6999999999998s)]
*  You're walking on stage and and you're like yeah what I have to say is [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=1349.78s)]

*  Yeah, you know [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=1377.06s)]

*  Online specials and social media and all this stuff, but like before I started comedy [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=1396.1799999999998s)]
*  I was maybe aware of five comedians [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=1400.98s)]
*  yeah, and they're only the top five bigot like you're not really aware of the [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=1403.1799999999998s)]
*  Comedy landscape right and so I don't think people really have been exposed to that [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=1409.58s)]
*  many female comedians [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=1415.46s)]
*  And I don't like to think about it because I don't want to have that perspective [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=1417.1s)]
*  I don't think it's helpful for me. Yeah to be like no no one's gonna. You know whatever I'm a pussy, but um I [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=1422.06s)]
*  Do notice it sometimes like online [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=1430.1s)]
*  Where you'll see like YouTube comments or something and you're like oh the rest of the country only thinks men are funny [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=1432.82s)]
*  Just naturally it's just like a misogynist thing yeah, but also who gives a fuck about them you have your own audience [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=1440.1s)]
*  Whatever yeah, I think I mean well finding your own audience is key [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=1447.06s)]
*  I mean I think different places I I think [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=1450.12s)]
*  And I don't know if it's the rest of the country thing. I don't know it's like [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=1454.28s)]
*  It always seems like I here's what I think sometimes as when I think about male and female comedians I [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=1458.52s)]
*  always men it always seems like [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=1466.1599999999999s)]
*  They are and maybe this is just because I've seen this in television and film over the years, but they're like the goofball [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=1469.28s)]
*  they're the [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=1476.0s)]
*  The fuck you know they're the bat bumbling [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=1478.0s)]
*  You know yeah, I know you mean and so you don't mind if something happens to the bumbling [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=1481.44s)]
*  You don't mind if that guy steps in a fire slips on a banana peel [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=1488.08s)]
*  For me the thing that always and this was the same thing about you watching UFC women. I didn't like it at first [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=1492.64s)]
*  I didn't like it because it felt like I didn't think all these people shouldn't be able to do this, right? [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=1499.12s)]
*  I think anybody should do whatever they want it just was like I always thought of women as like mom [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=1505.28s)]
*  Yeah, exactly and like a sister right so when you think about oh man my sister [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=1510.64s)]
*  You know it it's a male instinct versus your sister's getting in a fight [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=1515.14s)]
*  Yeah, help or like and then comedy I always felt like was such an uncomfort. I think also so it was like man [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=1518.6200000000001s)]
*  This is so uncomfortable. You don't want a woman doesn't need to go through this [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=1526.32s)]
*  My dad said like I should put my [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=1530.2s)]
*  Woman walking on stage. I should put my coat down over like you know yeah [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=1532.44s)]
*  So that she was a gentleman step in the state you know or step in the the so I think there's a lot of that [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=1536.0s)]
*  I don't know if it's that for me was never that women shouldn't do this [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=1541.8400000000001s)]
*  But I did always I think and it wasn't a choice. I made no it's an unconscious bias like for you [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=1547.52s)]
*  You're saying it's like a certain fragility that you're worried about [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=1553.98s)]
*  Yeah, I just felt like why do we like why do women have to do why do they need to? [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=1558.96s)]
*  Endure this [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=1565.12s)]
*  That's literally what my dad said to me like when I first started [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=1566.56s)]
*  He's like you are one of the smartest people I've ever met [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=1570.6s)]
*  Why are you choosing to put your life in a basement with drunks and fuck-ups? [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=1573.68s)]
*  But I was like fair fair point. You know but also it's just like it is what it is [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=1580.08s)]
*  It's like a like my I think what you're saying is totally real like cuz I feel that way that I'm received that way in Orange County [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=1585.84s)]
*  Cuz they cannot fathom that a woman would not my own [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=1592.76s)]
*  Focus and priority would not be to be married with three kids right now, right? [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=1597.8799999999999s)]
*  And like my family's never seen me my brothers have but my my parents have never seen me do comedy before [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=1602.8s)]
*  Wow or any of my TV stuff either well [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=1608.6399999999999s)]
*  Here's something also that happens a lot of women start doing comedy, right? [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=1611.8999999999999s)]
*  And I'm probably gonna receive hell for this because it's a very it's a generalization [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=1615.5600000000002s)]
*  Here's something that I sometimes feel could be realistic, and I don't know here we go um [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=1619.64s)]
*  And they and then the first thing they do is beat this woman drum [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=1625.88s)]
*  Instead of beating the comedy drum. You know it's like [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=1632.16s)]
*  You mean offstage [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=1637.0s)]
*  Yeah, kind of it's like I'm a female like somebody will be doing it a month [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=1638.88s)]
*  And they're big and they're just like I just start getting into like this [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=1642.4s)]
*  I'm a and I think maybe it was a kind of a fad that happened for a while it was like [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=1646.76s)]
*  And maybe women needed to meet maybe they need to do that to make sure that they're seen in like a in like a male [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=1652.16s)]
*  dominated [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=1657.92s)]
*  environment you know but I feel like sometimes uh [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=1659.0s)]
*  People will lean so much on any whatever it is that makes them [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=1663.1200000000001s)]
*  Like oh, I'm southern or I'm a woman or I was on fire you know you see some guy [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=1667.2s)]
*  And he's got skin grafts. He's like I was on fire. You know that's his big thing, and he's like you know [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=1671.96s)]
*  Fire shows you know we're doing everybody who's on been on fire ever you got to be on you know you're on the fire lineup [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=1676.64s)]
*  Only yeah, you know victim like you know like somebody neck brace line. You know it's neck brace night. Yeah fucking [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=1681.68s)]
*  And I don't think it's a bad. I'm not saying it's a bad thing. I don't know what I'm saying exactly [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=1690.04s)]
*  I guess I'm saying some people attach themselves so much to something that they [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=1693.64s)]
*  Forget that what they're doing is that you we still have to do the thing yeah, I mean I feel two ways [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=1701.46s)]
*  I'm not saying that about you. No. I don't think you're okay. Never even seen me do comedy. Yeah [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=1707.0s)]
*  I wonder if that's true or not. I don't think so [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=1712.28s)]
*  but yeah, I I [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=1716.84s)]
*  Want to be aware of shit and sometimes I can feel things like a lot of times [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=1720.12s)]
*  When I'm in a green room [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=1726.04s)]
*  I mean less now that I'm like more known [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=1727.24s)]
*  But like immediately when you walk in a green room if it's like a older comic or famous comic [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=1729.6s)]
*  They think that you're the girlfriend of another [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=1735.44s)]
*  But like that's not something I'm gonna get upset about but I can feel it immediately when I walk in or [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=1739.48s)]
*  When I'm on stage like you know comedy though is a meritocracy like it's an instantaneous [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=1744.36s)]
*  Reaction if you're not good. It's very apparent right now [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=1752.0s)]
*  I'm like yeah [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=1756.08s)]
*  I think so but then the industry also started with just where they're just picking people because of things and [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=1757.3999999999999s)]
*  That I think is certainly loosened up. I think some of the meritocracy of it. Yeah, that is a [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=1762.8799999999999s)]
*  True like it's much more diverse and in TV and everything and movies and opportunities and stuff [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=1768.4399999999998s)]
*  And I think that's a good thing. I don't think people should you know necessarily get something [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=1775.6799999999998s)]
*  For [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=1783.76s)]
*  without [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=1785.0s)]
*  handing value, but I like the diverse perspective, but [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=1786.24s)]
*  Yeah, I don't know. Yeah, I think it's good because I do think it's good in the sense that it helps like [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=1791.48s)]
*  It does help diversify things some you know it's like it helps like [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=1798.36s)]
*  Plant seeds and people who maybe they also need inspiration [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=1803.8s)]
*  They're young in their career [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=1806.8s)]
*  It's like maybe a face you wouldn't normally get to see because things are so if things are so often the same way [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=1807.72s)]
*  You know it gives different people opportunities. I think it's less [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=1813.4199999999998s)]
*  less [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=1818.32s)]
*  Caught stand-up is less driven by that then you know say television right just Hollywood in general [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=1820.32s)]
*  Yeah, like you see I'll see these lineups or whatever and I'm yeah, that wasn't the [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=1826.46s)]
*  Designing factor yeah [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=1831.94s)]
*  Yeah, it's interesting it's interesting cuz I wonder yeah [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=1837.78s)]
*  Why do I sometimes feel like or what are some of the things that make me feel like it's a man? [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=1840.42s)]
*  Sport or that it makes I think yeah, I think those are the things for me about that. It's like there's some [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=1845.46s)]
*  Fragility to it that you don't want it's like a I mean I don't know you well [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=1851.66s)]
*  but you seem like the [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=1856.06s)]
*  Area of comedy that you roll in is hyper masculine and the people that you're friends with [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=1859.66s)]
*  Yeah, I [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=1866.98s)]
*  Guess so yeah, I mean I have some female comedian friends. You know um [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=1868.74s)]
*  But I guess yeah, I mean I guess more of my comedian friends are probably man probably yeah, I mean that makes sense [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=1874.54s)]
*  Yeah, are more years women you think [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=1879.94s)]
*  No, I have like a mix. I mean I always say like I don't really like being a woman [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=1883.1000000000001s)]
*  Though the best part about being a woman is female friendship like my [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=1889.94s)]
*  girlfriends in comedy are it's just like the best thing in the world because we're not really like it's such a [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=1895.46s)]
*  It's such a distinct [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=1903.3400000000001s)]
*  Way of life that many people don't understand and especially like growing older as a woman [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=1905.8999999999999s)]
*  People can't really understand like why you would want to do it [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=1912.3s)]
*  So it's like you're really understand each other in a way that other people don't right, but um no [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=1915.74s)]
*  I love all my guy friends, and yeah, you're interesting. It's so there's also so few people that do it yeah [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=1920.4599999999998s)]
*  There's when you think about it like even when you said like there's you know [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=1930.06s)]
*  Like five minutes until you get into comedy and then you realize so many people have no nothing about comedy [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=1933.1s)]
*  Totally you're like in the world so you know you start to like but then there's so many people have no idea [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=1938.3799999999999s)]
*  About like they couldn't live like Chris right they would just name Chris rock like yeah, Eddie Murphy. You know they would yeah [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=1943.94s)]
*  They wouldn't know Robin right yeah, you know they have one point of reference like a lot of my girlfriends [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=1950.58s)]
*  And I joke about it, but like so many people will be like and they'll be trying to compliment you [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=1957.8999999999999s)]
*  But it's fucking rude [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=1963.8999999999999s)]
*  They'll be like you're like a more funny Amy Schumer or like a less funny Amy Schumer whatever it is [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=1965.1s)]
*  They're just comparing you and it's like you could just say good job, right? [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=1970.6999999999998s)]
*  Bitch yeah, people don't know how I mean I think some people also they just don't know that much [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=1975.06s)]
*  You know like you're saying if they're trying to give you a comment some people are bad at compliments [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=1979.9199999999998s)]
*  It's always like backhanded or whatever [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=1984.1399999999999s)]
*  But it's the point is that they have one woman and she has blonde hair right and so they immediately [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=1986.3799999999999s)]
*  They're like I have to make that association, and I have to tell it directly to this person. Yeah. Yeah [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=1991.54s)]
*  Yeah, I wonder what is it what is that in people that makes them that makes us feel like we have to do that sometimes [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=1996.5s)]
*  I [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=2002.98s)]
*  Think it's just because you want to try to feel connected you want to try to share something you know [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=2004.46s)]
*  It's interesting is if an old person says it you'll give them less grief than you would if like a young person says it [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=2009.68s)]
*  Yeah [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=2015.08s)]
*  That's how I try to think about like online comments [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=2016.32s)]
*  You know like if you see a crazy person yelling in the street [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=2019.2s)]
*  Where they're like you're fucking whore you know what I mean, and I'm like I didn't take that in [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=2023.68s)]
*  Well, I was just like that person's out of their fucking mind right, but if you see [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=2027.88s)]
*  But that's why I cheat them like oh, they're not well. They're commenting on a person. They don't know [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=2033.32s)]
*  They've never met who would do that take the time in their day to do that yeah [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=2038.68s)]
*  Yeah, who'd I see the other night? Oh Jessica Michelle Singleton is so funny. Have you seen her perform? Yeah? [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=2042.96s)]
*  I like Jessica Jesus Christ dude. It was one of the best sets. I've seen in so long. Oh, that's so nice [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=2048.66s)]
*  Yeah, so sweet, too. She's such a good person. It was oh it was so funny man [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=2053.6s)]
*  Yeah, maybe feel like damn [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=2059.16s)]
*  It was just really really impressive um [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=2061.6800000000003s)]
*  I [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=2063.8799999999997s)]
*  Wonder why else I've ever thought like that [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=2065.48s)]
*  Maybe because also when I was growing up they didn't have like I guess you had I'm trying to think of female comics [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=2067.48s)]
*  That I saw growing up Joan Rivers [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=2071.6s)]
*  Yep, Joan Rivers Paula Poundstone. Yeah, I remember um [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=2074.08s)]
*  Roseanne who I loved who was like probably one of my favorites [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=2078.9199999999996s)]
*  They've always had a good deal of female comedians though I [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=2083.48s)]
*  Guess like they didn't use that many comedians that people knew about yeah, Sarah Silverman [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=2087.04s)]
*  Yeah, yeah [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=2092.52s)]
*  I think Hollywood's always done a decent job of putting up [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=2094.28s)]
*  Probably a like pretty diverse group except when it gets outside of black white and female [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=2098.32s)]
*  After those I feel like it kind of fell off. I mean now it's different I [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=2104.56s)]
*  Think now things have been changing and going in a great direction, but like the women before me [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=2110.08s)]
*  They always said like you know [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=2116.88s)]
*  They could be better than some dudes and clubs like around the country wouldn't headline them because they said like people wouldn't come [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=2119.32s)]
*  You know so it's like based on like but then who's that is that anybody's fault though? [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=2126.2000000000003s)]
*  Is that just business like you can't business, but it's fucking dumb because it's not based on [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=2131.32s)]
*  Necessarily on talent like when you see like Lori Kilmartin when you watch Lori Kilmartin [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=2137.4s)]
*  She's like one of the best joke writers in the country and she just [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=2141.98s)]
*  Murders and to think of like a mediocre dude headlining over her is sad right you know what I mean right? [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=2145.0s)]
*  but I think a lot of that goes to like [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=2152.52s)]
*  just business it's the same as like [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=2155.08s)]
*  like you could put a ton you could lay you could put a [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=2158.12s)]
*  Lineup and diversify it all you want right but in the end if it doesn't sell take people aren't buying tickets to go [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=2161.84s)]
*  See it like if the if the people aren't buying tickets to go see it then no the market is dumb [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=2168.58s)]
*  right [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=2174.64s)]
*  So yeah, yeah in the end. It's like yeah, it just has to be so meritocracy [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=2176.8s)]
*  It doesn't always figure out I guess then does it no meritocracy is what I mean is just on stage where you're like right? [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=2180.84s)]
*  Okay, we'll see who's good. Who's not oh, I've seen tons of you over the years they get opportunities because of like nepotism [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=2188.04s)]
*  religion [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=2195.92s)]
*  You know like a certain friendship that kind of stuff just happens. I think it happens in all walks of life [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=2197.84s)]
*  You know yeah [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=2203.46s)]
*  Like you see but that's also the thing that makes you keep fucking going like if it if you showed up and just walked in [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=2206.1800000000003s)]
*  We're like hey, I'm here, and I'm funny. Yeah, just because I'm black female was in a fire [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=2213.0s)]
*  You know died and came back to life. I love how you keep saying [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=2219.6600000000003s)]
*  Was in a fire as if that was someone's thing. I'm just thinking different. Oh, it certainly is man [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=2223.7400000000002s)]
*  They got all these shows. It's like I saw one one show it was like [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=2228.82s)]
*  I [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=2232.22s)]
*  Haven't been going to these shows you've been going to it's just some of the things I get you know I get a link or something [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=2233.46s)]
*  Hey, check out this and it's all like [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=2238.7s)]
*  Like not a not victims of fliction well like a fliction night [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=2241.2999999999997s)]
*  I said publicly do not ask me to do your all female show that it's like [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=2245.96s)]
*  Ladies of laughter or some shit. I'm like that is so fucking humiliating [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=2252.42s)]
*  Why don't you just call it look at these clams yapping like I cannot I mean like I cannot [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=2256.78s)]
*  Fathom that shit. It's so embarrassing well here. Here's it so that here's something that happens. I think a [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=2264.38s)]
*  lot of men also for me, I remember like I was so it was so tough sometimes like [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=2270.34s)]
*  Who was I talking about one time? Oh? [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=2276.86s)]
*  Nikki glazed when I first heard her act it reminded me for some reason of my mother specifically [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=2280.02s)]
*  And so I like couldn't listen or comedy the beginning because there was just some weird [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=2284.52s)]
*  Correlation between like her and what my mom sounded like to me growing up right? Yeah, it's not that way now [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=2288.84s)]
*  I mean, and she know I've taught. It's just been like a funny thing, but [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=2295.0s)]
*  And I'm sure maybe girls women in weird ways right and girls probably do the same to guys I bet yeah [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=2299.72s)]
*  well, and there's also just a thing of like you know [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=2305.62s)]
*  It's good to be able to do well in front of everyone [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=2309.58s)]
*  But there are demographics that are gonna be not more naturally drawn to you and your material and who you are and what you're talking [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=2312.38s)]
*  About like I don't like right which is totally fine, and that's yeah [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=2318.5s)]
*  Like the other night. I did a show at that comedy jam jam in the vans [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=2322.7s)]
*  So and they we had if there was a comedian on the line up who's a female comedian right she says to me [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=2327.42s)]
*  Then the crowd was pretty diverse [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=2333.3399999999997s)]
*  She comes up to me after the show she goes I I just want to say I saw your crowd very diverse group [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=2335.6600000000003s)]

*  I'm attached to anybody is it because it limits your options. No, I don't think that that's it [[00:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=3471.2200000000003s)]
*  I think it's like some I mean [[00:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=3477.86s)]
*  I'm sure there's been times where well obviously maybe I did what didn't want to be in a relationship or something [[00:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=3479.98s)]
*  But I think for me when I was young like the only thing I felt like I had was the way you saw me like I [[00:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=3484.94s)]
*  was always like hyper managing like my [[00:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=3492.54s)]
*  Like I'd hated where we lived I hated our financial status [[00:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=3496.78s)]
*  I didn't like our family we had no family set up all these things that I had no control over [[00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=3500.46s)]
*  Yeah, that fucking mate just were like maybe so angry or uncomfortable and then [[00:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=3505.18s)]
*  The only thing I could control was how you saw me like when you saw me [[00:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=3511.4199999999996s)]
*  Yeah, you saw me so it was like I was constantly trying to manage this image of like I would take different buses to different neighborhoods [[00:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=3514.8599999999997s)]
*  And then fucking walk them this weird shit [[00:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=3522.46s)]
*  But then I always like was I think it was like [[00:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=3523.98s)]
*  Well, if I have somebody else attached to me and they do something weird or uncomfortable or whatever [[00:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=3527.14s)]
*  Then that's gonna be a reflection of how you see me it was just too much of a liability [[00:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=3531.5s)]
*  It's cuz it's all an outward focus [[00:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=3536.14s)]
*  Right like I'm concerned with what people yeah, I get that like I think that's something that's so natural [[00:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=3540.5s)]
*  especially as like teenagers and that whole time period and and then as you get older that's something I'm really focusing on we talked about [[00:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=3547.46s)]
*  in breath work, but like I [[00:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=3555.06s)]
*  Really want to not look outward and that's I stop I really have been [[00:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=3557.14s)]
*  Negotiating my relationship with Instagram too because I feel that's all looking outward [[00:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=3563.54s)]
*  Yeah, I'll black out and like lose an hour just like watching fucking Instagram stories and I'm like, this is hell [[00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=3568.34s)]
*  This is um, this is not like an intentional thing. I don't want to know what these people are fucking doing [[00:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=3574.38s)]
*  This is literally hell on earth. I'm afraid of being on my fucking deathbed and being like I didn't live life [[00:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=3579.42s)]
*  I was just looking at Instagram stories. Yeah [[00:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=3585.58s)]
*  And so I and like now also I'm really trying to think about like [[00:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=3589.9s)]
*  especially it is hard when we do this thing where you are really putting yourself out there to be seen and [[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=3596.94s)]
*  That's can be different. It's hard to be vulnerable in like a public [[01:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=3602.62s)]
*  Life like this and so in my mind one thing I'm working on is just maintaining my energy [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=3607.94s)]
*  No matter who I'm around like nobody is above me right nobody is below me who whoever they are [[01:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=3613.26s)]
*  Yeah, so that I'm not like outside myself. Oh, I see what you're saying [[01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=3620.1400000000003s)]
*  So it keeps everything in this ground where it's all like it's gonna be the same no matter what so that's a lot more manageable [[01:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=3624.94s)]
*  I'm not trying to impress anyone and I'm not trying to look down on anyone, right? [[01:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=3630.42s)]
*  That's like the state that I'm trying to hear. Yeah girl. That's a real tightrope. Yeah, I mean it's good [[01:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=3635.42s)]
*  No, it's a great. I love it practice right now be around like really big fucking people and [[01:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=3641.54s)]
*  They're just a person. Yeah, and I'm also around people like I [[01:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=3647.62s)]
*  Don't want I want to be regular with them. I want to treat that person [[01:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=3652.74s)]
*  That's like but like not wherever I am so exact fucking same. Yeah [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=3656.38s)]
*  Sometimes it's hard dude. They had this guy and like in a park next to our [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=3662.66s)]
*  My place out here and he was like playing this drummer all night. He does not a drummer right so that's a real [[01:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=3666.6200000000003s)]
*  That was a lot, you know [[01:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=3673.6200000000003s)]
*  Yeah [[01:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=3677.94s)]
*  Kind of but it kind of like it not during business hours, you know [[01:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=3679.1400000000003s)]
*  So sometimes it's hard man and just trying to treat everybody well and not fucking throw limes at that guy. Oh, yeah [[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=3682.06s)]
*  I know I will now I'll be like [[01:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=3687.54s)]
*  Aware of my impatience because you might be a highly sensitive person [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=3690.68s)]
*  Yeah, just 20% of the population. Is it really I identify unfortunately to my [[01:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=3695.48s)]
*  Humiliation as one of those people. I don't want to be a highly fucking sensitive [[01:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=3701.7999999999997s)]
*  You know, but I was this audience is probably highly [[01:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=3706.04s)]
*  That's my audience. Actually, it's like no, I mean highly sensitive or [[01:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=3708.64s)]
*  to environment noise, you know, oh, yeah, I am he sent [[01:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=3713.3599999999997s)]
*  Like all sorts of things like I really am that and it it doesn't [[01:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=3719.16s)]
*  It'll come up and I'm like, I'm gonna fucking kill this person. Yeah, but then I'm like, no, no relax [[01:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=3726.16s)]
*  How can you surrender? How can you just allow this reality to be since you have no control of it? Anyways? [[01:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=3730.7599999999998s)]
*  Yeah, that's true. But sometimes you gotta fucking put the hammer down. It's impossible enough sometimes not to put the fucking hammer down [[01:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=3737.5s)]

*  You know [[01:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=3984.04s)]
*  I think as you start to see like a lot of like as we get further away from like any type of faith and religion [[01:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=3984.8s)]
*  And religion or any like a lot of you do not have a real strong sense of faith [[01:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=3990.68s)]
*  I don't think these days [[01:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=3995.48s)]
*  So I think when you get like out there like that then you start to have people look at conspiracies more [[01:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=3996.56s)]
*  They want they're looking for something people always looking for something [[01:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=4001.4s)]

*  Yeah, like you know Judeo-Christian God or what? Yeah, I mean I believe in God [[01:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=4011.8799999999997s)]
*  I believe in a higher power and for me I use God is that is the sidewalk for that for me [[01:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=4017.32s)]
*  Yeah, so I think different people use different things, you know, yeah, I mean I've tried on many different things. Yeah. Yeah [[01:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=4023.1200000000003s)]
*  But now I just think of God as like [[01:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=4030.48s)]
*  divine loving intelligence [[01:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=4033.92s)]
*  Like completely divorced of all religion though religion. I don't know at this point doesn't really seem [[01:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=4035.88s)]
*  Like it for me like when I think of the Catholic shit, I'm just like that's fucking insane [[01:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=4042.92s)]
*  Like how are these folks not arrested ever? Yeah, like what do you mean? [[01:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=4049.36s)]

*  You know a lot of people want church. They are also brought up in churches. So it's like a comfortable place [[01:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=4103.08s)]
*  You know one of the things I love about churches like you go and you see like kids are playing together [[01:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=4108.32s)]
*  It's fun. It's like a fun place families get together. Yes. It's it's a family oriented thing. That's the thing [[01:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=4112.88s)]

*  Yeah, they would be has so much more integrity if they shipped all those fuckers to jail to Australia [[01:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=4127.32s)]
*  They said were they put them in jail. They said we are cleaning out our [[01:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=4133.599999999999s)]
*  Bravo, you know like Hollywood could do the same thing Hollywood was just a fucking critic to fucking create. It's definitely [[01:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=4141.24s)]
*  our coworkers [[01:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=4149.04s)]
*  Great. I love saying hello to them all the time. Hello at my place of work. It's really good [[01:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=4151.96s)]
*  But do you yeah? [[01:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=4158.759999999999s)]
*  Do you think it brings but then I think that just goes back to this how much like there's just a damaged element to being human [[01:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=4162.32s)]
*  100% is it is [[01:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=4171.12s)]
*  Humanity and look even the best person on earth has done horrible things. Yeah, John Legend the best person on [[01:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=4173.48s)]
*  And like and that was a joke, but yeah, I mean everybody's a piece of shit. You can't not it's not a piece of shit [[01:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=4181.96s)]
*  It's just like but everybody has shit on them. It's come of course everybody has shit on their shoes and some people in their shoes [[01:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=4188.24s)]
*  Yeah, it's it's really confusing and like I try [[01:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=4194.88s)]
*  One of the things I'm really working on is like not taking things personally. Yeah, just trying that on and [[01:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=4199.84s)]
*  It's hard cuz you're but it's like when I as I'm setting this intention [[01:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=4206.96s)]
*  I'm seeing it more clearly that like when someone does something to piss me off. Yeah, they're not even thinking about me [[01:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=4211.88s)]
*  They're fully viewing it through their own fucked up lens or whatever pain they're going through. You know what I mean, right? [[01:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=4218.64s)]
*  Yeah, right and we've also gotten so in our own world that that's the only lens we even have anymore [[01:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=4224.14s)]
*  So you're not even looking at things as a two-way street [[01:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=4228.66s)]
*  I noticed a few years ago when the elevator would open people would get in [[01:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=4230.7s)]
*  It used to always be yeah, it was always people got out first you wait [[01:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=4235.24s)]
*  It was just a natural thing and then now people get in. Yeah as it's like yeah, it's all kind of I [[01:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=4240.92s)]
*  don't know it's hard to know if it's [[01:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=4250.36s)]
*  it's hard to know if how much of what we are [[01:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=4253.68s)]
*  like suffering from or will suffer from if [[01:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=4257.0s)]
*  if it's like side effects of like [[01:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=4260.96s)]
*  Society or if it's just like this this flaw inside of us, I don't know. It's all of it. It's too much [[01:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=4263.820000000001s)]
*  It's not a flaw. I would encourage you to think of it differently [[01:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=4271.5s)]
*  What I like, you know the guy learned breathwork bro [[01:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=4276.78s)]
*  he divine healing as just [[01:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=4280.34s)]
*  when I love about it is because it takes all the pathology away and just a healing is just like [[01:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=4283.06s)]
*  Giving love to the places that hurt. Mmm, you know instead of like broken illness like that [[01:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=4289.0199999999995s)]
*  all these like things that we think are flaws or our brokenness or like make us unlovable and [[01:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=4296.46s)]
*  That is something I love about breathwork because it's so pure. It's just something [[01:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=4305.139999999999s)]
*  giving your God-given like natural structure putting it to use and [[01:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=4309.66s)]
*  Remembering the divinity of who you are. Mmm [[01:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=4315.86s)]
*  Yeah, it's a lot do you think that like [[01:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=4321.66s)]
*  But if we didn't have like flaw if we didn't do you think we ever get to a place where it's all evened out or [[01:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=4326.5s)]
*  It's just always this constant [[01:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=4332.0199999999995s)]
*  No, because that would be [[01:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=4334.259999999999s)]
*  Perfection and perfection doesn't exist. Yeah, and like trying for that is pain like, you know [[01:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=4337.9s)]
*  when you get into a [[01:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=4344.94s)]
*  Like of course you want to be stable and you want to be feeling good a majority of the time [[01:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=4346.42s)]
*  But I think the definition of mental health is [[01:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=4351.299999999999s)]
*  Being able to feel the full spectrum of emotions in a healthy way [[01:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=4355.099999999999s)]
*  Yeah [[01:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=4360.299999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I would say that that's probably sounds pretty fair to me. I would like that [[01:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=4361.86s)]
*  Yeah, but like when we like when I think then you get into spiritual bypassing which is like toxic positivity [[01:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=4366.78s)]
*  Which isn't like actually addressing how you feel or whatever [[01:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=4374.38s)]
*  As some way of like enlightenment and the fact is we're just all human, you know [[01:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=4378.9800000000005s)]
*  Yeah, I thought being human would be easier kind of no [[01:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=4384.9400000000005s)]
*  No, cuz everyone's dealt like whatever cards are dealt and I think it's just like our cosmic lessons on earth [[01:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=4389.22s)]
*  Yeah, I think for some reason I felt like it would be easier. Um, I feel like [[01:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=4396.7s)]
*  It looks pretty good from from where I'm sitting oh [[01:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=4401.6s)]
*  Thank you. I did wash my hair two days ago. I meant your life. Oh [[01:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=4405.92s)]
*  Yeah, no, my life is yeah, I think it doesn't matter. It's always like what you are [[01:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=4411.72s)]
*  Yeah, I don't know. I felt like I [[01:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=4417.72s)]
*  I always felt like if I got to a certain level of like doing well in my job or [[01:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=4420.88s)]
*  Maybe then I would [[01:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=4426.72s)]
*  Then everything would be okay [[01:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=4429.12s)]
*  I think I had this preconceived notion in my head that like all these other things that I worry about or fear [[01:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=4430.84s)]
*  Yeah, are these discomforts will disappear? [[01:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=4436.400000000001s)]
*  So when I started to have some success and that didn't happen, I think I was like kind of like there was a part of me [[01:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=4438.68s)]
*  I didn't even know this motor was running that expected this. Yeah, you know, then it was like, oh, you're still just [[01:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=4445.68s)]
*  you know with with [[01:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=4451.4400000000005s)]
*  Your weights, I think that's completely [[01:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=4454.08s)]
*  Natural thought like we're all looking for something to save us whether it's like success love [[01:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=4457.64s)]
*  Whatever it is. Yeah Botox or orthotics. Um [[01:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=4465.12s)]
*  Yeah, but I think like wealth and money and success [[01:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=4470.200000000001s)]
*  Really just brings out even more of what is already there. Yeah [[01:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=4474.68s)]
*  I'm sure it makes a lot of other things easier [[01:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=4479.56s)]
*  Well, Mark Norman said it best about having a little bit of money [[01:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=4482.76s)]
*  Here's what makes easier if you are cold or something and you're at like a gas station or something [[01:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=4485.12s)]
*  You don't have to like you know, you don't to look at the price of the sweet. You're like, okay [[01:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=4489.76s)]
*  I just can get this sweatshirt, you know, like little things like that are kind of nicer [[01:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=4493.12s)]
*  Like do I need like what how much is this lunch? [[01:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=4496.76s)]
*  It's like it saves you a little bit of time and having to look at some price tags [[01:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=4499.72s)]
*  If it's something big like a car or something, you're gonna look but like for the right, you know [[01:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=4502.5199999999995s)]
*  It's like that kind of stuff is a little bit nice [[01:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=4506.36s)]
*  You don't have to think about the cost of like, you know, really a meal maybe or something, you know [[01:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=4508.48s)]
*  Yeah, those things are kind of a little bit nice to have to have happen maybe [[01:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=4512.5199999999995s)]
*  So take me so I tried ketamine therapy was one thing that I tried like in the past [[01:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=4517.24s)]
*  Seven months maybe how many times I did six times. It was six six sessions [[01:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=4521.679999999999s)]
*  You sit with a therapist in a room [[01:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=4526.719999999999s)]
*  Yeah, and they fill you up and then you you know are talking with this therapist the psychiatrist the whole time [[01:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=4528.5599999999995s)]
*  Yeah, you're kind of going through things and like sharing and I [[01:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=4535.36s)]
*  Found that that was really interesting. I felt maybe for like trauma [[01:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=4539.719999999999s)]
*  like one specific trauma or something did you go deep in that I [[01:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=4543.759999999999s)]
*  Sometimes I was off the wall. I mean I was like in another [[01:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=4549.48s)]
*  Echelon, did you find it helpful? I found it helpful some I got to have some moments like I got to [[01:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=4553.0s)]
*  Spend time with my dad for like about 45 seconds, which was pretty cool [[01:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=4560.92s)]
*  Yeah, just to let him know that I loved him. I felt like he never knew maybe [[01:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=4566.08s)]
*  Wow, and it felt real like it felt as real as this sitting here talking. Yeah, that's really beautiful [[01:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=4569.28s)]
*  So to have something like that happen where it's like I got to see my mom when she was a little kid [[01:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=4575.04s)]
*  Which was pretty powerful. I felt like [[01:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=4580.639999999999s)]
*  You know [[01:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=4584.28s)]

*  We was more just doing like regular [[01:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=4602.84s)]
*  A big direction that people are going in with therapy and healing is just like going back to your inner child [[01:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=4607.12s)]
*  Yeah, cuz they say like your entire subconscious [[01:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=4614.48s)]
*  Blueprint for the rest of the your life is developed from zero to seven years old Wow [[01:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=4618.14s)]
*  So whatever goes down then is really [[01:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=4623.22s)]

*  That place is all about your inner child like you got to go to build a bear and get like a little child [[01:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=4651.9800000000005s)]

*  I don't even know what? [[01:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=5250.74s)]
*  Taking DMT would probably be very similar to the ayahuasca experience. I bet it's really hardcore [[01:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=5253.26s)]
*  But what the purpose of it is is the tough thing. I don't really know exactly [[01:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=5258.22s)]
*  I would like that made me realize, you know, I've done mushrooms and stuff [[01:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1YPEXDlsg&t=5261.42s)]
