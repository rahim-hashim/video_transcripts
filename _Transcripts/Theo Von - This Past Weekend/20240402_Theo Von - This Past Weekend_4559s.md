*  He was into fighting and stuff, and he was all ate up and everything. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=262.48s)]
*  Oh, damn. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=265.92s)]
*  And he really just became my best friend. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=266.56s)]
*  Really? [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=270.88s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=271.2s)]
*  Because a lot of people are scared of pit bulls. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=271.52s)]
*  And he was a little timid at first just because of what he went through. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=274.56s)]
*  And me and my dad was like, man, he went through war. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=277.84s)]
*  You know, and at that time, it was during the early 2000s when a lot of things, [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=280.08s)]
*  a lot of events had happened. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=286.47999999999996s)]
*  In the Middle East? [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=287.59999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, in the Middle East. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=288.56s)]
*  We named him Baghdad. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=290.32s)]
*  And another one was Ice. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=293.35999999999996s)]
*  Oh, now Ice seemed like he'd been into some other stuff. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=294.79999999999995s)]
*  It was a she. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=297.12s)]
*  It was a she. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=297.67999999999995s)]
*  Okay, I'm just saying, Ice seemed like he might have got off into the drug game. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=298.4s)]
*  We got her from a kid. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=302.08s)]
*  From a, is it little or a kitty? [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=303.59999999999997s)]
*  I think it was one of them. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=305.91999999999996s)]
*  We got her from a kennel. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=307.2s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=308.55999999999995s)]
*  So she was a puppy. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=309.52s)]
*  And we had her and she was feisty. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=310.96s)]
*  Really? [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=313.59999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, she was feisty. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=314.0s)]
*  A lot of these, yeah. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=314.88s)]
*  A lot of women, females are overall. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=316.0s)]
*  And that's fine. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=318.32s)]
*  Look, they gotta be feisty, man. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=319.84s)]
*  It seemed like you might have, did y'all have a cat or not? [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=323.59999999999997s)]
*  You don't see a lot of, did y'all ever own a cat? [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=326.0s)]
*  I'm not a cat guy. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=329.84s)]
*  One of my best friends, he's a cat guy. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=331.03999999999996s)]
*  Uh-uh. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=333.28s)]
*  You don't see, I think you don't see a lot of brothers with cats either, to be honest. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=334.56s)]
*  Honestly, growing up, I used to see a lot of stray cats because in the house I grew in, [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=339.92s)]
*  we had a lot of rats in the bottom of the house. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=344.0s)]
*  So cats, they would come and get them rats. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=347.36s)]
*  It was really like, I was a big fan of Tom and Jerry. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=349.28000000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=351.76s)]
*  Like that show. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=352.08s)]
*  And I had real life Tom and Jerry moments. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=352.8s)]
*  The cats. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=355.36s)]
*  We had Pitbull straight up in the back. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=356.48s)]
*  We had the cats running through. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=358.0s)]
*  Like they was alley cats too. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=359.12s)]
*  They were some bad because them rats, they was big. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=360.72s)]
*  They was small. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=362.4s)]
*  Damn, you're down living on Noah's Ark, bro. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=363.04s)]
*  That's how they danced over there. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=366.32s)]
*  It was a lot of species multiplying. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=368.0s)]
*  I'm trying to tell you, cockroaches, everything. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=370.24s)]
*  Oh, at night you've turned it, yeah, you turn the lights off. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=372.24s)]
*  You hear some romantic music going. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=374.64s)]
*  Man, what? [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=376.32s)]
*  You notice, and the animals are figuring it out, baby. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=376.8s)]
*  One of the most memorable things was the light bugs. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=380.4s)]
*  Do you remember light bugs? [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=382.4s)]
*  Did y'all have light bugs? [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=383.2s)]
*  I feel like they're extinct, bro. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=384.32s)]
*  I haven't seen any light bugs lately. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=385.52s)]
*  I think there's so much light now that's in the cities because in the day they didn't have as [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=387.04s)]
*  much, you know, like especially if you're in the country, you're in a smaller environment. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=390.8s)]
*  There's not, you're not, people aren't running around with so much lights everywhere. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=394.4s)]
*  You might have a porch light, maybe like a flood light by the garage. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=397.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=401.2s)]
*  So right off in the distance you would see them. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=401.59999999999997s)]
*  But now I think also when you're in a city, if you see a light bug in a city, he lost. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=403.52s)]
*  He got to be lost. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=408.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=409.84s)]
*  You know? [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=410.23999999999995s)]
*  I mean, he ain't. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=410.71999999999997s)]
*  He probably did. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=412.32s)]
*  He probably got hit by a windshield or something. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=413.03999999999996s)]
*  I guess. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=415.03999999999996s)]
*  Got knocked off and now he lost in the city. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=415.59999999999997s)]
*  That'd be a good movie, wouldn't it? [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=418.08s)]
*  A lost light bug, but they call them fireflies. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=419.59999999999997s)]
*  Like I never knew, understood it. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=421.76s)]
*  The lost fly. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=423.2s)]
*  But I think fireflies are maybe the ones that are out there popping off. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=424.0s)]
*  They shooting, bro. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=427.2s)]
*  I think light bugs are the ones that's out there really spreading the word. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=428.0s)]
*  I feel like. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=432.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=433.2s)]
*  Because a light bug was amazing when you were a kid and you saw a light bug. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=434.16s)]
*  Yeah, it was. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=437.28s)]
*  Because you didn't think it was anything in the dark and then you're seeing like literally [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=437.92s)]
*  and they like glow and they come back, they go dark and glow and like you end up following [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=442.16s)]
*  them. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=446.24s)]
*  It's like, you know, it's like at a kid, you know how you practice slow motion stuff. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=446.32s)]
*  It's like you would mimic the light bulb just going slowly, just seeing them just fly. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=450.24s)]
*  And they move like so subtle. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=454.08s)]
*  It was. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=455.68s)]
*  And then they disappear and you run back and tell your parents and that's when your mom [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=456.08s)]
*  usually like say to the dad, I think he's been smoking. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=459.36s)]
*  Well, it was so many, like we get flooded with light bugs. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=464.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=467.36s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=467.52s)]
*  We had to watch out for the rats and the cats, but yeah. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=467.92s)]
*  I remember they had, cause we would try to catch them in a jar. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=471.36s)]
*  If my grandmother would let it would give us like a little jar, like a mason jar, whatever [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=474.0s)]
*  we try to catch them in there. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=478.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=479.6s)]
*  But then they die. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=480.16s)]
*  If you don't put the air in it. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=481.04s)]
*  Yeah, they die. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=482.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=482.8s)]
*  We just catch them in our hands and let them go. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=482.96000000000004s)]
*  We ended up squishing them and it'd be sad, but some of my younger cousins, they would [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=485.28000000000003s)]
*  just take the light out of there. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=490.24s)]
*  Like, like this kid just pulled out this. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=491.52000000000004s)]
*  Oh dang. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=493.6s)]
*  Somebody grew up to be an electrician probably. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=494.24s)]
*  Most likely. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=496.40000000000003s)]
*  Cause that's it. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=497.6s)]
*  I mean, that is intense behavior. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=498.16s)]
*  To pull the light out of it. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=500.08000000000004s)]
*  I don't think they had a lot of electricity. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=501.68s)]
*  Okay. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=504.40000000000003s)]
*  I think they pulling their soul out with the light. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=504.72s)]
*  If something's flying around and they just got about half a watt on them. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=506.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=512.72s)]
*  Put it on top of your head like, I had an idea to take this from you. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=515.68s)]
*  Oh, that's wild, man. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=520.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=522.56s)]
*  I love stuff like that. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=522.8s)]
*  I loved being like a child and like, cause every experience was so new. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=524.24s)]
*  Everything when I was a kid was new, man. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=529.1999999999999s)]
*  That's one thing I really miss. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=531.4399999999999s)]
*  Like you just so innocent. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=533.84s)]
*  As a kid, like not much heartbreak, not much real failure. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=535.4399999999999s)]
*  You know, everything is just a new experience to you. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=539.28s)]
*  Like you always know, like if I fall down, I'm getting right back up. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=541.4399999999999s)]
*  I'm continuing to play. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=543.68s)]
*  I feel like when we were young, like everyone was outside. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=545.12s)]
*  You know, it wasn't like a video game time or anything like that. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=547.76s)]
*  Like we was outside playing. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=551.36s)]
*  We didn't know other people were getting into fights. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=552.48s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=554.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=555.12s)]

*  I'm excited to have an opportunity to be at a, you know, a story franchise and, [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=670.88s)]
*  and, and, and bring them hope. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=675.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=677.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=678.24s)]
*  How do you, what is like the process as that happens? [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=678.56s)]
*  Like, like how do you find out that you're going to go somewhere else? [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=682.0s)]
*  What's that process like? [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=686.8s)]
*  It's like a, [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=688.16s)]
*  do you hear about it first or it really is a surprise? [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=688.96s)]
*  It's like a vetting process. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=691.36s)]
*  Well, you, you know, you got, you got some type of inclination. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=692.56s)]
*  Like when you've been in place for four years and you haven't like moved up in the light, [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=695.04s)]
*  look at it as a company, you haven't moved up in a company and year by year, [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=699.2s)]
*  like you moving down, like eventually, like they, you about to get replaced or you about [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=703.2s)]
*  to be out of there or like they're not going to invest in, invest in you or they don't think [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=707.6s)]
*  that you worthy of an investment, you know, so you go and look for other opportunities. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=711.68s)]
*  And the best thing is when opportunity presents itself to you, because then you can grasp it. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=716.5600000000001s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=721.44s)]
*  When you are in a position where like you are starving for opportunities, [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=722.0s)]
*  like that's a little bit more challenging, you know, so this one in this case, man, [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=725.28s)]
*  it was a, it was a great opportunity with, with Cleveland and, you know, you got agents and you [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=728.48s)]
*  have a relationship that you build with these coaches and GMs, general managers of the team. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=734.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=738.72s)]
*  And, and that- [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=739.2s)]
*  You feel good about it there? [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=740.08s)]
*  Yeah, I feel, I feel good about it because how I view it, like, bro, it's the opportunity, [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=741.2800000000001s)]
*  it's the opportunity to impact, it's the opportunity to increase, [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=745.9200000000001s)]
*  it's opportunity to better myself, you know, and I know I'm a strong component of like, [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=748.4000000000001s)]
*  like change is what you make it, bro. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=754.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=756.48s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? Sometimes we need that, that shift, that paradigm shift to like challenge [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=756.96s)]
*  us to put us in a new environment, you know? [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=761.84s)]
*  Hmm. Yeah. I feel that a lot, man. I feel that even as like there are moments in my own life [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=763.6800000000001s)]
*  and career where things have been going well, and then there's moments where things feel like [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=768.88s)]
*  they haven't, my perception of things is that they haven't been going well. And, man, sometimes I get [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=774.56s)]
*  scared of how I behave when things aren't going well, or the feelings that come up, the fears that [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=781.04s)]
*  like take over how I operate or, yeah, I'll get into like, not as much a desperation mode because [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=786.72s)]
*  I've had some experience with some of it now, but I do get into, yeah, the first thing to leave is [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=795.68s)]
*  my faith or confidence that things are going to be okay a lot of times, you know, because it feels [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=802.4s)]
*  scary. Well, I think like the fear, the fear part is that's what, that's what grabs you, you know, [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=807.3599999999999s)]
*  that's what puts you in that fight or flight stage. But when you, you said faith, like faith is the [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=813.28s)]
*  first thing that you should hold on to because faith is really the things that you believe in [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=817.68s)]
*  that you have not seen. Like typically when you experience pain is something that you have [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=821.76s)]
*  experienced, you've seen it, it's happened to you. And I think that's why I'm always in this position [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=825.6s)]
*  because my faith allows me to hope for more, to want more, right? And like, and to dig in even deeper, [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=831.52s)]
*  you know, I feel like when you are like, when you think of a seed, right, if I look at a seed, [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=840.0s)]
*  like let's, let's, let's do it. Let's do an acorn. It's just like you look at an acorn, but it's a [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=845.6s)]
*  seed, it's a good seed too. An acorn is turned into oak trees. You know what I'm saying? Did you [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=851.28s)]
*  know that? That's a good point. Right. So that seed, but for that seed to grow into what it needs to [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=855.28s)]
*  become, it has to, it has one, it has to break. Like that seed has to be broken, right? And then [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=860.9599999999999s)]
*  it has to get rooted. So before it sprouts up, it has to go down into the earth and establish a [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=866.64s)]
*  foundation. So when you think about challenges, right, it's telling you, like it's the Lord telling [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=872.88s)]
*  you like, Hey man, like we're gonna have to have a shift. You got to get rooted in the real foundation, [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=877.36s)]
*  which is me, right? Which is the Lord, which is Jesus. Right. That's your foundation. And before [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=882.24s)]
*  you can grow up, right, you're going to have some little seedlings, like you're going to have a [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=888.24s)]
*  little cracks in here. You might have a little bird trying to come and snatch you out. But through [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=891.6800000000001s)]
*  that trial, right, you're going to be able to turn to this beautiful oak tree and you're going to be [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=897.04s)]
*  able to be fruitful and give to others through your testimony, through your experiences. And when you [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=902.08s)]
*  view it from that perspective, now that fear isn't as frightening. Yeah. No, I feel that. And when we [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=907.44s)]
*  talk about like, like as kids, the reason we're feeling is that as kids, because we know we're [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=914.72s)]
*  going to get another opportunity. We know, okay, if we get scrubbed on the football field, okay, we [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=919.84s)]
*  got tomorrow. Right. You know what I'm saying? But as adults, those little pains that we get, you know, [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=924.64s)]
*  those little failures, they eat at us. And we start asking, we start questioning ourselves like, [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=930.56s)]
*  wow, like are they better than me? Or like, am I missing something that I used to have? But as a [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=935.5999999999999s)]
*  kid, just like, man, I'm proud of the moment. Like we out here again. Yeah. We live and local. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=942.56s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? Like I'm here. But as adults, it's those conditions, man. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=946.8s)]
*  Yeah. The conditions change because when you're a child, you really have so much [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=951.68s)]
*  blind faith. Don't you? Even if you don't, even if as a kid, you don't perceive it as faith in a [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=955.28s)]
*  higher power, you just feel it as faith that you're going to have another opportunity that [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=960.4s)]
*  you've got the next day. Wow. It's really crazy how much that changes over time. Cause yeah, [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=964.88s)]
*  it's the conditions that change. And then it's, um, it's choices and decisions, especially as an [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=970.24s)]
*  adult. As a, as a kid, you don't like you making decisions, but you're making decisions off of [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=975.52s)]
*  default, right? As you get older and as you get more intentional with your work, like you work [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=980.72s)]
*  your tail off and you got a strategic plan to what you're doing. Like it's some people that [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=987.12s)]
*  think they're working, but they don't, they're, they're just working off default, like off of [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=991.68s)]
*  every day. Like I'm waking up, I'm going to work. They're not designing nothing throughout their [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=995.52s)]
*  day to actually have an impact on their life that they've been given. Yeah. That's kind of [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=1000.08s)]
*  interesting. Some people don't have the opportunity. Some people, they just don't want to accept the [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=1006.08s)]
*  challenge probably either. Sometimes you need a little bit more, a little bit more gravitas. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=1011.68s)]
*  And that's what you can have when you elevate your morning with Tommy John, second skin underwear, [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=1018.88s)]

*  having won a Heisman trophy, like how, how, and having been a, a starter that has [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=1156.8799999999999s)]
*  all types of accolades, interesting and powerful in the NFL. What is it like to be a backup [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=1164.8s)]
*  quarterback? Like what is, what do people not know about being a backup? That's some of the [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=1172.8s)]
*  tougher things, probably. I think the, one of the most challenging things is like you have to prepare [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=1176.9599999999998s)]
*  as if you're the starter. Because the thing about the quarterback is, it's only one person. They get [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=1180.8799999999999s)]
*  every other position has depth. Like they have someone else that's aligned with them. That's [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=1185.76s)]
*  doing essentially the same thing that they're doing. There's only one person on the field [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=1190.64s)]
*  playing quarterback, right? And there's three people, maybe four in a room. [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=1195.3600000000001s)]
*  So all those people in the room are prepl, are preparing for that specific role. [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=1200.0s)]
*  Right. That's why, cause yeah, other, other jobs don't have a backup. Like you don't have like a [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=1205.3600000000001s)]
*  backup mayor sitting in the next room. He's in there signing documents and it's like cutting [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=1209.2800000000002s)]
*  ribbons, you know, practicing cutting ribbons with big scissors, right? You know, or you don't [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=1215.0400000000002s)]
*  have a backup waiter, you know, like if your waiter's doing, you know, and he's in a parking [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=1219.44s)]
*  lot, he's just running fake food out to people. You know, yeah. So that pressure isn't right there [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=1223.2s)]
*  with other jobs. No, it's not, but it's, it's, uh, you know, pressure is for the unprepared. [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=1228.96s)]
*  That's why you got to stay prepared, like in any role that you, but specifically as the backup, [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=1234.24s)]
*  you got to prepare like you to starter. You know what I'm saying? That's why I'm always going to [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=1238.96s)]
*  view myself as a starter because I know like it happened to me, it happened to some of the greatest. [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=1242.48s)]
*  You are one play in the sport that we play from your career being over, from you losing your job [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=1247.92s)]
*  or you becoming irrelevant. Oh Lord, baby. You know what I'm saying? Like that's like, that is [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=1255.28s)]
*  the sport that that's the business that we in. That's the sport that we play. So I approach all [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=1259.76s)]
*  that with gratitude, bro. Like I'm grateful for each day. I'm grateful to prepare, right? Like [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=1264.32s)]
*  I'm going to support whoever is in front of me. I'm going to support all my teammates, but brother, [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=1268.8s)]
*  I know what's real and what's real is any moment, anytime, any place, anything can happen. [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=1272.88s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? Oh, any time. [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=1280.64s)]
*  Man. Yeah, I guess that's so true. I see. Do you see other people don't keep that same energy? [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=1286.0s)]
*  Like, is it a, cause perspective is so much a life I learned is about perspective, man. [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=1291.2s)]
*  If you could show up really with a gratitude and really with the perspective that there's possibility [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=1297.2s)]
*  at any moment, that changes everything. You become a beacon. You become a light [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=1302.24s)]
*  bug for other people at that point. Well, we call it to be, you know, the light of the earth, you know? [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=1307.36s)]
*  So I think when you in that role, it's not your job to see like, are they doing what I'm doing [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=1315.44s)]
*  or am I doing what they're doing? It's your job to see, man, how can I perfect what I'm doing to [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=1322.72s)]
*  encourage somebody else to perfect what they're doing so they can be their best self? Wow. You [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=1326.64s)]
*  know, like, and I think that we get so much like, because we all compete, right? We all, we all [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=1331.2s)]
*  chasing this, this rat race. We all chasing something that's greater than us. Right. But [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=1336.48s)]
*  a lot of times we, we're so busy looking at other people running their race and sort of focusing on [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=1340.56s)]
*  the race that you got to run. And I think one thing that I've learned through experience, because [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=1347.2s)]
*  experience, like experiences through like certain conditions, circumstances, and facts, [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=1352.32s)]
*  like that's what creates perspective. You know, that's what gives people that wisdom, you know, [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=1357.2s)]
*  because they went through something. Oh yeah. And that's why, you know, I always, I'm always [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=1361.6000000000001s)]
*  hanging around, you know, like you saw, you saw, I call my granddad, I'm always hanging around people [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=1367.04s)]
*  that are, that are wise and older because their experiences are, it's freaking gold, bro. Oh yeah. [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=1371.92s)]
*  Like they've been through so much stuff and they've overcome so many different things. Oh yeah. Bro, [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=1377.6000000000001s)]
*  the slowest way to learn is through your experience. So why not pick somebody else's [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=1382.8799999999999s)]
*  brain? Why not learn or hang around somebody that's an old, old head? Senior citizen, yeah. [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=1388.08s)]
*  Bring a couple owls with you. Senior citizen, yeah. That's the person. You know what I'm saying? [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=1392.3999999999999s)]
*  I do that all the time. Yeah. Get you a couple owls, baby. That's what you need, you know? [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=1395.9199999999998s)]
*  My wife, she a rice owl. Oh, she went to rice? Yeah, she went to rice. Yeah. Oh wow. I saw, [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=1401.12s)]
*  oh yeah, Ellis, you beat them the other day. I saw them in the women's game. They did. But for rice, [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=1405.6s)]
*  though, I think rice just happened that they got to play LSU. I mean, look, they're a starch. Yeah, [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=1409.6s)]
*  that is true. You know what I'm saying? A lot of people, they used to be in a recipe and suddenly. [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=1414.6399999999999s)]
*  Right, you know what I'm saying? They actually in the mix, you know? When you get gumbo, you [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=1420.48s)]
*  ain't thinking about the rice, you're thinking about the gumbo. Oh, the game has changed. That's [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=1425.76s)]
*  the super bowl for them if they end up in a gumbo. Right, it is. You got to play with Drew [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=1428.8799999999999s)]
*  Breeze for a season, right? And Drew, I got to meet Drew one time, right? So Drew Breeze is an [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=1435.04s)]
*  intense dude, man. He's locked in. You know, you could see that he, you know, it was at a dinner [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=1441.84s)]
*  party and you could see while he's talking to me behind me, he sees the whole dinner scenario. [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=1447.2s)]
*  You know, like he sees like, you know, the waiter is in the flat, you know, the bus boy gave up on [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=1453.84s)]
*  his route early. The strong safety is rolling silverware. The maitre d is out of position. [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=1460.16s)]
*  You could see he's got a lot going on, you know? What do you get to learn from like somebody that's [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=1466.16s)]
*  that, like a hall of fame? Like what is the difference in being around somebody like that? [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=1472.24s)]
*  I think one thing about Drew is like he was very observant. He was very detailed and he was very [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=1478.64s)]
*  intentional with everything that he did. Like, so he had a mission for everything that he was doing. [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=1483.76s)]
*  It was on purpose. So real purposeful. Yeah. So I knew what his intent was for each day because he [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=1488.64s)]
*  knew what his, he was, that's how he led. He led by example. He led by, you know, showing you like, [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=1495.6000000000001s)]
*  this is what I'm about. Either you're going to join or you're going to get left behind, right? [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=1500.5600000000002s)]
*  And I think that's why people follow him because they knew his direction. But I think just sitting [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=1505.1200000000001s)]
*  back from afar, learning just the X and O's, being able to see the relationship with him [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=1511.2800000000002s)]
*  in his long time head coach, Sean Payton, but also reading books about Drew Brees, understanding the [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=1517.44s)]
*  perspective, understanding that he went through one of his most challenging times, you know, [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=1523.6000000000001s)]
*  when they won the Super Bowl, you know, I'll let you look up what happened, but he had certain [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=1528.64s)]
*  circumstances, conditions, and facts that happened in his life, even in his NFL career early on in [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=1536.88s)]
*  his career, a team didn't believe in him. So he continued to grow. He didn't point fingers, [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=1542.8s)]
*  blame anybody else. He continued to overcome the naysayers, you know, and he set that standard [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=1550.6399999999999s)]
*  every single day. And like, and when you're around someone like that, like you gain that perspective [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=1557.28s)]
*  and like, and that was a year that actually, like, I was so grateful for that year to sit behind a [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=1562.32s)]
*  Hall of Fame quarterback, learn how he moved and everything, because me and Drew Brees are two, [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=1567.84s)]
*  like we are two separate, like he is from one side of the block, I'm from the other side of the block. [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=1573.6799999999998s)]
*  So being able to be around him every single day and just be in his presence, you know what I'm [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=1579.52s)]
*  saying? See how he living, you know what I'm saying? You know, with Drew Brees, you know? [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=1586.0s)]
*  What you snacking on, Drew. You know what I'm saying? Like, what you got him a rice crispy treat over that? [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=1590.56s)]
*  And one of the greatest things like that I learned by Drew Brees is like, he helped me with food [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=1595.76s)]
*  because his meals used to look so bad. I used to question like, are we in New Orleans? Like, [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=1601.84s)]
*  we don't got no chef that can cook Drew Brees. Some that look better than this. Yes. You know [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=1610.0s)]
*  what I'm saying? Like, but he was so strict with the way he ate, you know, he was so intentional [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=1615.04s)]
*  with everything that he did. And I was like, okay, that's the sacrifice that's allowing you [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=1619.84s)]
*  to be the elite of the elite. You know what I'm saying? Those are the disciplines that you're [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=1625.52s)]
*  willing to take to be in the city like New Orleans and not eat the stuff, you know what I'm saying? [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=1630.1599999999999s)]
*  Not put that stuff in your body. Like, bro, no seasoning, like at all. I don't even think, [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=1636.1599999999999s)]
*  he probably used salt and pepper once. Oh Lord, that was probably on Christmas Eve. You know what [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=1642.56s)]
*  I'm saying? They come with everything. You know what I'm saying? I know. Imagine. Yeah. [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=1646.72s)]
*  Not even, oh. But no, he was an amazing, amazing human being. Get him a spice rack for Christmas. [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=1651.04s)]
*  Yeah, for real. Changes a little. But you're right. That level of commitment though, [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=1656.8s)]
*  because also a lot of salt gets into your joints and stuff like that, especially as you get older, [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=1661.3600000000001s)]
*  it gets, that's a thing that happens to people, you know what I think. But yeah, I guess interesting [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=1665.3600000000001s)]
*  to see that just that level of commitment and the amount of commitment we feel like we have to make [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=1669.92s)]
*  to ourselves. Cause some people hold themselves to such a high standard that if they don't make [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=1675.36s)]
*  a certain amount of level of commitment to themselves, then they don't feel complete. [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=1679.52s)]
*  Some people may hold themselves to a different standard and it's fine, whatever your standard is, [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=1686.08s)]
*  but we all have this level, I think of where if we hold ourselves there [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=1690.32s)]
*  and we meet ourselves there, then we feel complete, you know? Yeah. I think it's, I know it is, [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=1694.9599999999998s)]
*  it's great to challenge yourself and to push new limits and go to different heights, you know what [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=1702.4s)]
*  I'm saying? And be tough on yourself, but you also got to give yourself some grace. That's where that [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=1707.1200000000001s)]
*  balance come in. You know what I'm saying? You can't be your worst enemy and your biggest fan. [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=1711.8400000000001s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? That's how I get. You know what I'm saying? I turn into my worst. Yeah, [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=1719.6000000000001s)]
*  it's like I'm trying so much, I end up being my worst enemy, bro. But you being two different [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=1724.56s)]
*  people. You know, I feel like we talk to ourselves more than anybody else talked to us. Yeah. So you [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=1728.96s)]
*  got to give yourself that grace, man. You got to speak life into you more than anybody else is [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=1734.8s)]
*  going to be speaking life into you because I guarantee you somebody else, they care about [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=1738.4s)]
*  themselves more than they care about you. Yeah. So if you down in you all the time, [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=1743.1200000000001s)]
*  how's that going to make you feel down, depressed? Oh my goodness. Now I got to do this. Now I got to [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=1748.64s)]
*  do that. Now I got to revert to this versus like, man, like, okay, I didn't fail. Okay. I'm not the [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=1753.76s)]
*  only person to fail. You know what I'm saying? Okay. How I get about it is, you know, who I need [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=1759.28s)]
*  to talk to to get about it is, you know what I'm saying? Like my lawyer, usually, hopefully we won't [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=1763.68s)]
*  have to get to know legal. That's what he's trying to stay out of. I'm just talking about self esteem. [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=1770.08s)]
*  Like what Cat Williams said, it's called self esteem. You know what I'm saying? Like, come on, [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=1779.2s)]
*  you got to lift yourself up, man. You got to give yourself life. That's a good point. Huh? Yeah. I [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=1784.24s)]
*  think I wonder, yeah, sometimes it's hard for me to see what the conversation I'm having with myself [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=1789.92s)]
*  is. Does that make any sense? Yeah, that makes a lot of sense because we like, I say it like this, [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=1794.96s)]
*  why do we give other people better advice than we give ourselves? I know it's like we, [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=1801.44s)]
*  we counsel ourselves out because we don't listen to ourselves. So when we not listen to ourselves, [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=1805.28s)]
*  how do we expect to hear ourselves when we in this funk or we in this like this, this, this, [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=1810.6399999999999s)]

*  kid. We having an anxiety attack or we spazzing out, you know, all of us have those moments, [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=1830.48s)]
*  but the ones that are able to, you know, look at those moments, reflect on those moments and [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=1836.0s)]
*  build off those moments and not let those moments destroy them. Like the ones that end up being [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=1843.04s)]
*  successful. It's interesting, huh? So much of that war is really, it's a peace talk, but you have to [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=1847.68s)]
*  bring yourself to the table. That's the tough, I just have, sometimes I have tough times in that [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=1853.76s)]

*  verses, trust in the Lord with your whole heart and lean on it to your own understandings. [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=1886.56s)]
*  Acknowledge the Lord in all your ways and he shall direct your paths. You know what I'm saying? [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=1891.28s)]

*  but then there is that fear that comes with it. It's like, how do I manage the fear while I'm doing [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=2168.72s)]

*  Yeah. Cause a lot of times, man, there'll be opportunities and I get so fearful. I stand [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=2206.88s)]
*  there like this, like Barry Sanders, and then I don't pick nothing. He went, he went standing. [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=2210.6400000000003s)]

*  could get both of them and see and find the right one. Um, when you were growing up, I know I've [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=2234.0s)]

*  condone a father might be in the house. The dad might want to be in the baby life and the mama [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=2427.0400000000004s)]

*  something out of nothing. And I think we get so caught up in the, uh, oh, pity part is like, yo, [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=2475.44s)]
*  you ain't have a dad in your life. Oh yeah, bro. I'm with you. Like my dad and when they my life [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=2483.36s)]

*  we didn't have a daddy in our life or our mama was crazy to us? Or are we going to say like, [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=2498.88s)]
*  look, my, my situation was not, it wasn't ideal, you know, but I, but I know through those, [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=2504.72s)]
*  through those circumstances, through those experience that I've grew and I've gained a [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=2512.64s)]
*  lot of, uh, knowledge. I gained a lot. I went through a lot of pain and, but at the end of the [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=2516.88s)]
*  day, I'm going to be the one to decide, you know, my fate is my, is my response. My emotions are my [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=2523.12s)]
*  responsibility. My actions are my responsibilities. Now I might have certain conditions, facts and [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=2531.12s)]
*  circumstances that may have led to some of them decisions, but at the end of the day, [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=2537.76s)]
*  it's still my responsibility because when you get out of that childhood, when you get out of that [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=2543.36s)]
*  kid stage and you an adult, ain't nobody looking at you like, Oh, he must have had a dad or father [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=2548.5600000000004s)]

*  I'm going to grow up. For real. That's what it is. Yeah. That's a great point, man. I think there's [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=2558.48s)]
*  aspects of my life where I've like, I think I was like a late bloomer too, like realizing a [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=2563.68s)]
*  lot of stuff and getting past like a lot of childhood stuff, but I certainly feel like I'm [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=2568.4s)]
*  at a point now where I want to grow up more in some areas, you know, and I pray that's what I [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=2573.2799999999997s)]
*  pray about each day. I pray that God makes me more willing to, uh, advance in some of these places [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=2578.0s)]
*  and to let go of some resentments and help like soften some of the, uh, discomfort that I have [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=2584.4s)]
*  in places. Cause sometimes there's things that are still hooking you to your past, you know? [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=2590.88s)]
*  And it's like, uh, sometimes it's hard to get, you know, like when you have like a, you had a boat [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=2595.28s)]
*  dock and you got the things tied up and some drunk guy tied the one and he tied a damn Christmas bow [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=2599.52s)]
*  on it or something. You can't get, sometimes it's like, I got those. I really believe we have [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=2605.6s)]
*  certain curses that are on us that were put on us through our family, through generations, you know, [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=2610.08s)]
*  of them, you know, living a life. But I also believe in that, that bondage, that true peace. And [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=2617.2799999999997s)]
*  you know, again, let's talk about our faith. Let's talk about accepting our Lord and Savior, [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=2623.7599999999998s)]
*  Jesus Christ, man, and being separated from all that bondage and realizing like it is my life to [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=2628.64s)]
*  I am free from everything that I feel like is holding me back to go do what I need to do for [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=2634.4s)]
*  this world, for me. And I know it's tough, like- [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=2642.24s)]
*  No, no, I know you're not saying it's possible for everybody easily, but it's something we have to [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=2645.8399999999997s)]
*  hear. And that's why I'm listening to you say it. I'm happy to hear it today. It's a message that [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=2650.16s)]
*  I need to be reminded of. And I think that's why you're even saying it right now. And we're in the [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=2657.04s)]
*  same space. Cause yeah, I need to be reminded of that. That how long do I want to sit and look at [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=2661.68s)]
*  the chains instead of look out the window? You know, like how, you know, like at a certain point, [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=2667.04s)]
*  even my eyes are tired of looking at those chains. It's truly perspective. Like we, man, [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=2672.88s)]
*  so I'm every year, Black History Month, like I want to learn something new about Black history. [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=2679.04s)]
*  Obviously being from the South, like my image on slavery and Jim Crow laws in the dirty South is [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=2685.12s)]
*  just this gruesome image, like white versus black, like, man, they hated us and like, I can't believe [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=2690.72s)]
*  they look at it. They act like it's not that far. They act like it's a hundred years from now, [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=2697.2000000000003s)]
*  but it's very recent. But I got this respect if I was watching this masterclass about African [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=2702.32s)]
*  American history, Black history on masterclass. And when my perspective was changed from all the [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=2710.6400000000003s)]
*  great things that African-Americans have accomplished, besides all of the treacherous [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=2717.44s)]
*  things that African-Americans went through, I started to see again, that light that's inside [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=2722.72s)]
*  of me, like, wow, like I possess this. Man, yes, my people were enslaved. Yes, my people went through [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=2728.0s)]
*  some terrible circumstances. They went through a rough time, but man, look at how my people [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=2734.08s)]
*  overcame. Look at the love. Look at the power. Look at the victory that came from all that. [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=2740.0s)]
*  You came to a world where you were enslaved and now we walk around free. We walk around doing [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=2746.16s)]
*  whatever we want to do. Go down Bourbon Street and see if you could sense anything. You know what [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=2753.2799999999997s)]
*  I'm saying? It's just wildness. And it's truly- Yeah, I get jealous of Black community sometimes [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=2760.72s)]
*  because they got the best origin story. Like, I always liked the, like, if you look at a superhero [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=2766.08s)]
*  or something, you got to have that origin story. And it's easy for me to like, I'm not going to say [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=2771.44s)]
*  like, oh, what a unique origin story. Cause obviously I know that there's tons of things [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=2777.84s)]
*  that I don't even understand in it. I don't even understand like when somebody looks in a, takes a [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=2782.48s)]
*  23 and me or something, they can't even, or they don't even know past where their grandparents [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=2788.4s)]
*  are from. I don't know what that feels like. You know, I don't know what it feels like to be in a [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=2792.08s)]
*  place where you showed up as a commodity. You know, like I don't have, I don't know any of what that [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=2796.72s)]
*  really feels like, you know, but I do think it's a, there is something interesting about having a, [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=2803.3599999999997s)]
*  an origin story that you can derive if you're able to start to turn a corner in your perspective [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=2813.2799999999997s)]
*  while still acknowledging the past, but to have it be one of looking forward. [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=2822.64s)]
*  Right. Well, I think you got to acknowledge the past because that's how you learn. That's how you [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=2830.8799999999997s)]
*  grow. But also believe that when you, when you have acknowledged the past, you got to, you got to think [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=2834.48s)]
*  about ways that you can change it, right? Not think of like, at first I was so into like, okay, this is [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=2842.0s)]
*  me. Like you did this to me. Like, this is why I'm behind and my dad ain't living in a [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=2849.04s)]
*  multimillion dollar house. Like I'm behind the eight ball, right? We don't have generational wealth [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=2855.36s)]
*  because we couldn't have generational right. Right. But now I look at it as like, man, like, okay, [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=2859.36s)]

*  to be Mormon, I'm wondering. You know? Or does he, you know what I'm saying? Does he really want to [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=3252.7999999999997s)]

*  my brain is bad today. Joseph Smith. Yeah, you can go see, like, the campus, the Mormon campus and [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=3282.96s)]
*  everything. It's beautiful. It's stunning over there. Um, Jamis, when you look at guys like, [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=3290.32s)]
*  Caleb Williams has caught a lot of flack this year. I think more than to me, it feels like just as a, [[00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=3297.92s)]
*  like a, just a fan, uh, it feels like he's caught more flack than anybody, a starting quarterback [[00:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=3303.92s)]
*  in a long time who's going to come out of the draft. Um, they recently, they're talking about [[00:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=3309.92s)]
*  him for having a pink phone case or just his, uh, or just, or fingernail policies. It seemed like a [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=3315.92s)]
*  level of scrutiny that's, it's almost gone overboard, man. I think, like, to whom much is [[00:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=3324.08s)]
*  given, much required. And when you are, um, when you are in a position, uh, as he is, and when you [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=3330.16s)]
*  reach a level of excellence that he has attained as being an excellent college quarterback, it just [[00:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=3337.2799999999997s)]
*  comes with the territory, you know? And I think in, like, if I was in his shoes, I know what it's, [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=3342.96s)]
*  I know what it's like to be scrutinized like that on a whole different spectrum. Uh, and you have to, [[00:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=3348.48s)]
*  you have to focus on who you are. Uh, you have to get closer to the people that's around you. [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=3354.32s)]
*  You gotta, you gotta push through that now. Like, I don't, I don't know about the fingernail [[00:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=3359.44s)]
*  policies and the lipstick and stuff. Like this is, this is life, you know? Uh, look, we've all been [[00:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=3363.52s)]
*  to, yeah, we've had, have all had a moment or something. Like this is, look, this is live or [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=3368.8s)]
*  whatever. I know he can play football and I know that, uh, character is what you do when no one is [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=3374.48s)]
*  looking. So I just, I pray that he is focusing on his character and that in football ain't everything [[00:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=3382.4s)]
*  for him. Right. And I, and I know he'd been to Oklahoma. I was an Oklahoma fan. I grew up an [[00:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=3389.12s)]
*  Oklahoma fan. Really? Yeah, I really did, bro. Why though? Because Oklahoma beat Florida State in [[00:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=3393.36s)]
*  2000. That's championship. Oh, so you just, that's how you got on. Florida State was my daddy team. [[00:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=3399.44s)]
*  So I was just like, I was one of them bandwagon. I just jumped on. I was like, boom, sooner ever [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=3404.88s)]
*  since then, you know? So that's why I like Baker Mayfield, Kyle Murray. Like, dude, I love Baker, [[00:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=3409.2799999999997s)]
*  bro. Bro, is there anybody more fun to cheer for than Baker? I feel like. Man. Baker is a dog. [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=3413.52s)]
*  I think he is a, he is a beast, man. He will not be denied, man. I mean, the opposition had him at, [[00:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=3420.0s)]
*  like, it's almost a rap. It felt like, but then he's like, nuh uh. He out. He out. And now look at [[00:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=3427.04s)]

*  Yeah. I feel like he's one of those guys that everybody, if you don't support Baker, I don't [[00:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=3443.7599999999998s)]
*  understand where you're at. Yeah. You know? Yeah. Just that pressure. But do you feel like the media [[00:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=3447.68s)]
*  is at a place where it's just, or it's just always going to be like that? It just feels like this [[00:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=3451.68s)]
*  year, like they've gone crazy on him. Like who cares? Like it's a young guy trying to be a good [[00:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=3455.04s)]
*  quarterback. Man. And like these are kids that they're scrutinizing, but in, in, in the common eye, [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=3461.2s)]
*  you can be a kid, but if you're a celebrity, you a grown man. Right. And like, and now everyone's so [[00:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=3471.36s)]

*  Yeah, I know that is true. It's interesting. Um, what else did I want to think about? Yeah. [[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=3596.56s)]
*  I guess just being in a new place. Have you gone to Cleveland yet and picked out a home and everything? [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=3603.04s)]
*  Man, I went to Cleveland. Uh, uh, I haven't picked out a home yet, but it was like, it was [[01:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=3606.72s)]
*  really like I opened it. It was like, cause people, people rip on Cleveland a lot, you know, [[01:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=3613.28s)]
*  they do. And it's a beautiful city, but like, obviously when we talk about Cleveland, they say, [[01:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=3617.76s)]
*  it's cold. It's going to be cold up there. And when you come from Tampa in New Orleans, like it [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=3622.6400000000003s)]
*  don't really get cold here, you know, and then it was cold maybe in the freezer section at Rouse's. [[01:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=3626.0800000000004s)]
*  That's it, bro. But it was one of the moments where like I'm, I'm getting my physical, you know, [[01:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=3631.28s)]
*  and it was cold when we got there. But, uh, her name was Julie. She'd say, yo, it's snowing. [[01:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=3635.92s)]
*  I was like, it's snowing out here in March. I ain't never seen no snow in March. So I sent the video [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=3642.4s)]
*  to my wife and I was like, Hey baby, look, it's snowing. And she was like, I am not a kid, [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=3648.4s)]
*  Jamis. You don't have to tell me it's snowing. I see it's snowing. It was like, I don't want to [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=3653.6800000000003s)]
*  see no snow right now. I want to see a beach. I was like, all right, you got it. You know, but I [[01:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=3657.84s)]
*  guess they're going to talk about the cold. Back to the drawing board. No, for real. Like you started [[01:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=3663.28s)]
*  all over again. That's a husband's job. He's just like, start all over again. You know, I just, [[01:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=3667.2s)]

*  It was very scary for me, man. But that's my high school sweetheart. And like, man, you're talking [[01:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=3687.2s)]
*  about fear. Like commitment to one person is that is fear, you know, because your life is in their [[01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=3692.4s)]
*  hands and their life is in your hands. So when you're maneuvering and when you have all these [[01:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=3701.2000000000003s)]
*  different experiences that's coming at you, you have to be strong, man. You have to be strong and [[01:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=3707.36s)]
*  know like this is my priority. This is my love. Like this is my first love, right? Whatever can be [[01:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=3714.0s)]
*  attractive to my eyes or anything outside of that. Like it doesn't, I don't condone that, [[01:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=3720.0s)]
*  you know, and plus my girl, like she an OG, man. Like she was like really the dream. Like I was a [[01:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=3725.28s)]
*  football player and obviously I was an athlete in high school and she was a hooper. Like, you know, [[01:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=3730.88s)]
*  back in the day, love and basketball, that was everything. Oh yeah, that was romantic. My whole [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=3736.16s)]
*  thing was like, man, like I wish I knew how to play basketball so I could have a love and [[01:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=3740.96s)]
*  basketball moment. But boom, like God bless me with a girl that can hoop. That was pretty to have [[01:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=3744.16s)]
*  all these best eyes, like her eyes. I just stare at her eyes and it's just like, [[01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=3749.04s)]
*  what you doing with them eyes? But like when I was blessed with that, man, I was like, my heart was [[01:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=3755.68s)]
*  took. You know what I'm saying? There y'all are right there. Yeah, that's us, man. [[01:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=3763.12s)]
*  And y'all in the water, baby, getting it, huh? That's our house, man. [[01:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=3767.52s)]
*  Oh, that's beautiful, man. My brother, that ain't my brother for real, but that's like my [[01:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=3772.88s)]
*  life coach. He right there. That's your life guard too. He ain't a dang, he ain't a shy, [[01:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=3777.8399999999997s)]
*  that ain't the shallow end, I don't think. It's a step. Okay. And look, and we tried to, [[01:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=3782.4s)]
*  we had him on a brick. So he would be level. He slipped off the brick, you know what I'm saying, [[01:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=3786.72s)]
*  during the ceremony. We was like, all right, man, we know you dedicated. Yeah. Oh, that's cheating at [[01:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=3792.64s)]
*  the combine if you standing on a brick. I know that, man. I don't think nobody was expecting [[01:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=3797.52s)]
*  to get, you know, they pants wet, but I was like, we got to get in the water, like, [[01:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=3804.48s)]
*  because this is what it is. It's water. We got to be flowing, like, we got to be water together. [[01:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=3808.96s)]
*  I love it, man. I like that, man. You just kind of make your choices and that's it for you, [[01:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=3812.96s)]
*  you know? It seemed like your self-confidence is that a unique, is it really unique compared [[01:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=3818.32s)]
*  to other people, man? Yeah. Were you always like that, do you feel like, or was that something [[01:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=3823.04s)]
*  that was kind of built? Do you think it was just a gift that you had? I feel like it's still growing. [[01:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=3826.88s)]
*  I've always been confident in myself, but more importantly, in my faith, you know what I'm saying? [[01:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=3831.44s)]
*  Like, I was rooted in a church, like, oh, Southern Baptist. From when you were little. From when I [[01:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=3836.2400000000002s)]
*  was little, but when I actually started to know God and I started to understand that I'm fighting [[01:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=3841.76s)]
*  from victory, not for victory, like, then I took a different approach to the way that I live. [[01:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=3847.12s)]
*  And I think it's like the accumulation of really who you surround yourself with, like, seeing other [[01:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=3855.28s)]
*  people that's like walking, like firm, that are strong brothers, that ain't like lukewarm, like, [[01:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=3860.96s)]
*  that gives you that confidence, like, that gives you that affirmation to be like, okay, like, man, [[01:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=3866.56s)]
*  I need to, like, what am I doing? Like you said, you question yourself. It's been so a lot of times [[01:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=3870.64s)]
*  where I've questioned myself. It's been some lot of times in the NFL where I just like, man, like, [[01:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=3874.7200000000003s)]
*  like, who am I? Like, what I got going on? You know what I'm saying? But at the end of the day, [[01:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=3879.44s)]
*  I had to dig deep and just be like, okay, like, this is who I am. Right. You know what I'm saying? [[01:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=3884.88s)]
*  Get back to your root to your foundation. What is my foundation? If I don't, if I don't believe in [[01:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=3889.68s)]
*  this foundation that I built, then why did I even build it then? Why you have to, yeah. I'm not here [[01:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=3896.08s)]
*  for no reason. I'm here for a purpose, my own unique purpose. All right. So I got to live it. [[01:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=3900.96s)]
*  Dang, man. I might try out for somebody. You could do it, bro. Yeah, the colts might need [[01:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=3908.08s)]
*  someone. I don't know who needs somebody right now. What do you think about this new rule with [[01:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=3913.3599999999997s)]
*  the hip drop tackle? Do you have any thoughts on it? Yeah, I think, I think it is, they're trying [[01:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=3917.52s)]
*  to make the game safer. But as I've been in the league, you know, I've seen it trend to be more [[01:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=3923.04s)]
*  of a, you know, a player friendly league. I think it takes an incredible amount of discipline and, [[01:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=3929.92s)]
*  and athletic ability as people that are actually making those tackles to avoid making that tackle. [[01:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=3938.24s)]
*  So I think like when you make a rule, like you say, okay, this is the rule. We can't do this no [[01:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=3944.16s)]
*  more. But as athletes being trained to do a certain way, like for years, but for their whole life, [[01:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=3948.48s)]
*  to just get somebody on the ground anyway possible, I think it's challenging, man. And I'm, [[01:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=3957.6s)]
*  and I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm happy for player safety, but at the same time, like I know, like I'm from [[01:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=3963.92s)]
*  Alabama, like we love football. Right. However, if you get, if you run across the middle and [[01:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=3969.68s)]
*  somebody take your head off, that's football. Get back up. Are you okay? Your chest up? Okay. [[01:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=3975.3599999999997s)]
*  What'd you say? How many fingers I got? You know what I'm saying? Okay, come on. We, we about to [[01:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=3980.8799999999997s)]
*  do it again. You know what I'm saying? I'm dropping back in the pocket. Somebody come and slap me [[01:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=3984.48s)]
*  on my head. Like, okay, I want that 15, but like, Hey, like, okay. I see you came to play today. [[01:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=3988.64s)]
*  Okay. Like it's just, it's the brotherhood and it's the light. Like we warriors out there, man. [[01:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=3994.08s)]
*  Like I said earlier, like, man, we want to play away from our career being done, you know? So I [[01:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=3999.12s)]
*  do respect the NFL making this player safety protocol and like doing everything they can to help, [[01:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=4005.2s)]
*  you know, prolong people's careers. But I think it's tough. I think it's tough on the players. [[01:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=4010.88s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. I think it's interesting to see like, and if you keep making things like, I worry about [[01:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=4014.4s)]
*  if you put so much in the hands of the referees, cause there's a lot of people start to say that [[01:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=4020.96s)]
*  a lot of speculation you see of people saying that things are fixed or organized or, you know, [[01:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=4027.36s)]
*  gambling is a lot more just in our everyday life. Now every other commercial is for it. [[01:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=4032.48s)]
*  You know, I mean, we advertise it. It's like, it's everywhere. So I just wonder when you put stuff [[01:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=4037.28s)]
*  more in the hands of the referees too, and give them one more space where it could be a crucial [[01:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=4043.52s)]
*  call in a playoff game next year. What does that look like? You know, how weird is that? You know, [[01:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=4048.56s)]
*  when you look at the field, you know, a lot of times people just see the two teams, right? [[01:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=4054.56s)]
*  Team A, team B. But bro, you forget it's another team out there and they got on black and white, [[01:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=4060.72s)]
*  right? And they're working together. Like a lot of these, a lot of the referees, like when you get [[01:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=4067.3599999999997s)]
*  to know them, like, bro, like they're insurance agents. They're not even doing this year round. [[01:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=4071.52s)]
*  You know, this is a hobby for them to make, you know, six, six, six, for real, six figures just to [[01:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=4076.8799999999997s)]
*  what you're doing. Get on side. You know, I have a mix tape one dude, but yeah, I know they had one [[01:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=4084.3999999999996s)]
*  video, some guy he tapped into the, make the announcement and he played half a track off of [[01:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=4091.3599999999997s)]
*  his mix tape and people were like, well, what is even going on here? It is, is, is you got to think [[01:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=4095.9199999999996s)]
*  about how tough it is first to make in game decisions to police grown men that are playing [[01:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=4100.32s)]
*  at the fastest level. So I got a lot of respect for the referees, but man, like it's a third team, [[01:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=4106.48s)]
*  bro. Like you playing against two teams. You're not just playing against the other team. You play [[01:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=4111.76s)]
*  against two teams because you know, they have the rules and regulations in this day job, but they [[01:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=4115.92s)]
*  can dictate a game now as, as a leader, uh, as a coach or a person of, of influence, like you can't [[01:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=4120.16s)]
*  say we can't, we're not going to allow the refs to dictate this game, but they have a certain level [[01:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=4127.92s)]
*  of authority that can't, if they make a call and they're human, just like us, if it's a mistake, [[01:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=4136.48s)]
*  they ain't finna say, Oh my bad. Like literally look, we write reports out of the game. Coaches [[01:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=4142.799999999999s)]
*  are sending it, sending it in like, this was a penalty. This was a penalty. You'll get a [[01:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=4148.48s)]
*  letter back. This was a penalty. Sorry. I don't know if they said sorry. Like sorry is very polite, [[01:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=4151.599999999999s)]
*  but they're, they're literally be like, this is emoji. Yeah. It's like, that was a penalty. [[01:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=4159.839999999999s)]
*  Move to the next one. Yeah. And he was like, what? We can't get that play back. And it's crazy. [[01:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=4166.56s)]
*  Well, yeah. There was that famous play in New Orleans that happened too. I think this was before [[01:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=4172.88s)]
*  you were here. Whenever there was a passing or against the Rams, it took them from going to the [[01:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtDfwDYtUR4&t=4176.24s)]
