*  Thank you so much for your support. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=34.56s)]
*  Thanks for tuning in. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=37.28s)]
*  Today's episodes are regarding the conflict in Israel and Palestine. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=38.72s)]
*  I've heard a lot about this issue and I wanted to deepen my own understanding. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=43.16s)]
*  I recognize that this is a sensitive topic, but the only way to truly learn is to seek knowledge. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=47.44s)]
*  I decided to have guests from both sides of the aisle, if you will, to help me learn by sharing their views. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=53.88s)]
*  I did this in separate episodes because I'm not a debate moderator. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=61.2s)]
*  And I chose guests who I thought would share their views sincerely, and I think both of them did. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=65.12s)]
*  I'm very thankful to have the opportunity to learn, which is something that they don't even have in some countries. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=71.04s)]
*  Today's guest is a comedian who was born in Egypt and now lives here in America. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=76.92s)]
*  He's also a political commentator, writer and a former medical surgeon. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=81.68s)]
*  He's been called the John Stewart of the Arab world and has been pretty vocal about the Israel-Palestine conflict for years. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=86.96000000000001s)]
*  You may have seen his viral appearance on Piers Morgan. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=94.56s)]
*  We're going to talk about that and a lot more. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=97.72s)]
*  I'm very grateful for his time. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=100.4s)]
*  Today's guest is Bassam Youssef. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=102.64000000000001s)]
*  I'll sit and tell you my stories [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=111.68s)]
*  Shine on me [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=116.68s)]
*  And I will find a song I've been singing for so long [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=120.68s)]
*  Bassam Youssef. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=133.68s)]
*  Yes. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=134.68s)]
*  That's how you say it. Bassam? [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=135.68s)]
*  No, Bassam. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=136.68s)]
*  Bassam. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=137.68s)]
*  Bassam. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=138.68s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=139.68s)]
*  Bassam. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=140.68s)]
*  Bassam, yeah. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=141.68s)]
*  Your student special at the Wiltern. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=142.68s)]
*  Yes. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=144.68s)]
*  On October 4th. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=145.68s)]
*  Yes. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=147.68s)]
*  Okay. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=148.68s)]
*  And what kind of like, so your audience is predominantly, because you're Egyptian. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=149.68s)]
*  Yes. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=152.68s)]
*  And is your audience mostly like Egyptian folks or does all Middle Eastern people come out and support a Middle Eastern comedian? [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=153.68s)]
*  Mostly brown people, 60% Arabs, sometimes 50% and then maybe 20% like Indian Pakistanis. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=160.68s)]
*  And then there's the white. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=167.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=168.68s)]
*  And then you get like between 20 to 30% white people. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=169.68s)]
*  But it's different from each state, from each show. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=172.68s)]
*  So it's been quite a riot, to be honest. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=177.68s)]
*  Yeah, you've been doing comedy because you were a surgeon. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=181.68s)]
*  A heart surgeon, yeah. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=184.68s)]
*  You're a heart surgeon. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=185.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=186.68s)]
*  That's crazy. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=187.68s)]
*  I know. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=188.68s)]
*  Why would you stop doing that? [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=189.68s)]
*  Why would you? [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=190.68s)]
*  No, why do it? [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=191.68s)]
*  Because medicine is terrible. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=192.68s)]
*  It's a thankless job. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=193.68s)]
*  Is it? [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=195.68s)]
*  Yes. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=196.68s)]
*  I've been doing it for 19 years of my life in medicine, 19 years of my life. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=197.68s)]
*  And I say my show, I mean, you do that because that's what's expected of you in the Middle East. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=200.68s)]
*  In the Middle East, you're expected to be one of three things, a doctor, an engineer or a disappointment. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=206.68s)]
*  So I didn't want to disappoint my parents. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=211.68s)]
*  So I did my, I went into medicine and I went there for 19 years. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=213.68s)]
*  I didn't have any kind of aspirations. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=217.68s)]
*  It's like, what do you want to do? [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=219.68s)]
*  I'm just going to do the regular stuff. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=220.68s)]
*  I didn't, I wasn't the guy who's cracking jokes in class or anything. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=222.68s)]
*  Really? [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=226.68s)]
*  No, no. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=227.68s)]
*  A regular guy, just a regular boring guy. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=228.68s)]
*  Really? [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=231.68s)]
*  Just a boring guy? [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=232.68s)]
*  Very boring. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=233.68s)]
*  And then, so how do you realize you're able to be a comedian then? [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=234.68s)]
*  Because that's kind of... [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=236.68s)]
*  I didn't. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=237.68s)]
*  You didn't think at all when you were a kid? [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=238.68s)]
*  I didn't. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=239.68s)]
*  I didn't. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=240.68s)]
*  Revolution happened in Egypt 2011 and I just happened to be like a regular fan for John Stewart. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=241.68s)]
*  And so I watched John Stewart for years and I had this dream of maybe I'll be a writer on a similar show in Egypt. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=249.68s)]
*  So when the revolution happened and I saw the kind of crazy stuff that they've been showing on television. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=255.68s)]
*  So it's like the craziest conspiracy theories ever. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=262.68s)]
*  And that was a revolution in Egypt? [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=266.68s)]
*  Yes. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=268.68s)]
*  So the states from media was running all kinds of crazy stuff. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=269.68s)]
*  So I started doing YouTube videos, making fun of it. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=273.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=276.68s)]
*  Blew up. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=277.68s)]
*  And in two weeks, I had millions of views on my YouTube channel that I just opened. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=278.68s)]
*  I didn't even have a YouTube channel before that. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=284.68s)]
*  And then suddenly every single platform, every single television station won me on the show. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=286.68s)]
*  And now it's a... [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=292.68s)]
*  Now, do a show. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=293.68s)]
*  So I did a show out of nothing. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=294.68s)]
*  And I hired people who was not in the business, people who are like amateurs like me. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=296.68s)]
*  And it became the biggest show in the Middle East. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=301.68s)]
*  And I had 40 million people watching each episode. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=303.68s)]
*  And so how does that end? [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=306.68s)]
*  Did you just... [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=308.68s)]
*  Oh, I was kicked out. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=309.68s)]
*  I had my show canceled a couple of times. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=310.68s)]
*  I had even the signal, the satellite signal jammed a couple of times. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=312.68s)]
*  I had lawsuits. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=316.68s)]
*  I had shows shut down. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=317.68s)]
*  People threatened around me. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=320.68s)]
*  I was threatened. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=321.68s)]
*  And then I... [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=322.68s)]
*  By both regimes. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=323.68s)]
*  I went through three different regimes. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=324.68s)]
*  Oh, wow. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=326.68s)]
*  Military, Islamist military. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=327.68s)]
*  And then they both hated me. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=329.68s)]
*  And that one, it's you. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=331.68s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=333.68s)]
*  When you make fun of people and everybody hates you, it's like, okay, I think you're doing the right thing. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=334.68s)]
*  And I couldn't do the show anymore. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=338.68s)]
*  So I escaped. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=340.68s)]
*  I left Egypt 2014. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=341.68s)]
*  I came here into a very dark era. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=342.68s)]
*  I didn't know... [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=346.68s)]
*  You know, you're more like I was everything. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=347.68s)]
*  And then I came here and I'm nothing, nobody. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=349.68s)]
*  And it was humbling. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=352.68s)]
*  Because I thought, hey, I have a good story. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=353.68s)]
*  I'm a doctor. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=356.68s)]
*  I did comedy. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=357.68s)]
*  I should come here and Hollywood should open its door. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=358.68s)]
*  Nothing. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=360.68s)]
*  Nobody cares about you. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=361.68s)]
*  Like, yeah, you were great in Egypt. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=362.68s)]
*  Now, we don't know what to do with you. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=363.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=365.68s)]
*  So I... [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=366.68s)]
*  I think it's got to be a big transfer. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=367.68s)]
*  I think that's scary. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=369.68s)]
*  That would have to be one of the scariest things, I think, for a comic is going to another country because the entire template of everything is different. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=370.68s)]
*  Like the pentameter of what's funny, like things that people know and don't know, references, all of that. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=378.68s)]
*  And then you're in a whole new space and Hollywood does not care, really. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=385.68s)]
*  It's like you show up. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=388.68s)]
*  They don't care. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=389.68s)]
*  It doesn't matter. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=390.68s)]
*  And you have to understand, I was even a comedian who changed. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=391.68s)]
*  I just been there for three years. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=393.68s)]
*  I just left medicine. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=395.68s)]
*  Did a show out of nothing, became successful. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=397.68s)]
*  So I only had two, three years under my belt coming to America as a comedian in Arabic. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=400.68s)]
*  So I got here. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=406.68s)]
*  So I started doing stand-up comedy and I sucked so bad because it's my second language. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=408.68s)]
*  And also I did... [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=415.68s)]
*  It's not just the language. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=416.68s)]
*  It's the rhythm, the music. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=417.68s)]
*  Each language has its pauses, its rhythm, its cadence. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=418.68s)]
*  And I would write stuff that would be intelligent, but I wouldn't deliver it right. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=422.68s)]
*  So I went into the years of darkness and humiliation. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=428.68s)]
*  And that was here in the US? [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=433.68s)]
*  That's when you first started stand-up? [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=434.68s)]
*  Yes. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=436.68s)]
*  Wow. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=437.68s)]
*  What was your first set at here? [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=438.68s)]
*  I did something in... [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=439.68s)]
*  Oh, the improv, like open mic and it was terrible. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=445.68s)]
*  And I did a few, could open my mics and then I... [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=448.68s)]
*  But here's the trick. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=453.68s)]
*  What helped me is that I was someone with a good story. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=454.68s)]
*  So I didn't go into comedy like right away. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=457.68s)]
*  I won a speaker series. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=461.68s)]
*  I'm a guy. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=463.68s)]
*  I came from the revolution, Egypt. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=464.68s)]
*  So I wouldn't go to talk to universities. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=465.68s)]
*  Like a talk. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=467.68s)]
*  A talk. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=468.68s)]
*  And then with that talk, I would put jokes. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=469.68s)]
*  And then I was like, oh, I have a five minutes. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=471.68s)]
*  Let me try it. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=473.68s)]
*  And then I suck. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=474.68s)]
*  It's like, no, that's not the five minutes. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=475.68s)]
*  Now I have two minutes. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=476.68s)]
*  Yeah, two minutes. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=477.68s)]
*  So I would go back and forth back and forth back. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=478.68s)]
*  And went for years. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=480.68s)]
*  And when COVID hit, I still went on the road because I needed to have any time I can get. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=481.68s)]
*  So I'll go and I would play for five people, six people. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=487.68s)]
*  And it was funny that people knew me from Egypt, from my own country, Arabs and Egyptians would know me. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=491.68s)]
*  And they would see my names like, oh, we have to come and see Bassem Youssef now in their mind. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=499.68s)]
*  Is this guy with this huge show. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=503.68s)]
*  And they come and I'm a struggling comedian. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=504.68s)]
*  And I would see it on their faces. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=506.68s)]
*  They would say, oh, too bad. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=508.68s)]
*  Bassem is a husband. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=510.68s)]
*  Maybe he'll be driving an Uber in three months. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=512.6800000000001s)]
*  Yeah, maybe this is how we make his money. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=514.6800000000001s)]
*  So it was very humiliating for me. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=516.6800000000001s)]
*  And then two years ago, something happened. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=518.6800000000001s)]
*  Started to filling spaces, places have kind of a few souls. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=520.6800000000001s)]
*  And I was like, oh, I'm going to go to a place. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=522.6800000000001s)]
*  I'm going to go to a place. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=524.6800000000001s)]
*  And then I was like, oh, I'm going to go to a place. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=526.6800000000001s)]
*  And then I was like, oh, I'm going to go to a place. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=528.6800000000001s)]
*  And then I was like, oh, I'm going to go to a place. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=530.6800000000001s)]
*  So they answered me at a time of happening. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=532.68s)]
*  Its by accident. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=533.68s)]
*  I was in Baku. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=535.68s)]
*  I was in a gather. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=537.68s)]
*  I was in Baku. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=539.68s)]
*  I was in a gathering when you called me. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=540.68s)]
*  I was playing badminton. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=542.68s)]
*  The club I was running was with M repeatedly, [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=543.68s)]
* 시� is where everybody has had a special stage of badminton [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=545.68s)]
*  gets to their level when it it goes on to big stages in [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=547.68s)]
*  between and after. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=549.68s)]
*  And so it was wonderful. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=551.68s)]
*  This young觥 reconnaissance came into being. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=552.68s)]
*  I've got a few lots of it. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=554.68s)]
*  And with in someHe Fr古, [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=556.68s)]
*  there's a play with a b rashЛley with a lot of fans like [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=558.68s)]
*  what? [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=560.68s)]
*  If I was, if that, if the piece of Morgan thing happened, [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=561.68s)]
*  if that, two years earlier, I wouldn't be good enough. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=565.52s)]
*  And people would come and get disappointed. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=568.68s)]
*  So I think I took my time and I think I'm grateful for that. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=570.3199999999999s)]
*  Yeah, it's funny you said about like your time [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=574.9s)]
*  and how it like, you think you have, [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=576.5799999999999s)]
*  I remember when I first thought I had like five minutes, [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=578.1999999999999s)]
*  I'd be like, I'm the guys, I'm doing, [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=580.4399999999999s)]
*  I got five minutes, you know, calm down. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=581.68s)]
*  But then you realize if you have five minutes, [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=584.04s)]
*  you really only have like two minutes, you know? [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=585.4799999999999s)]
*  It's like when it really, when you cook the fat down [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=587.3199999999999s)]
*  and kind of figure things out. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=590.08s)]
*  Yeah, that Piers Morgan thing was huge for you. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=593.6s)]
*  Yes. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=595.84s)]
*  That was huge. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=596.68s)]
*  Came out of nothing. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=597.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=598.34s)]
*  Came out of nowhere. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=599.18s)]
*  A comedian friend of mine, Amir Kay, connected us [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=600.0s)]
*  and he works with me a lot on the road. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=602.68s)]
*  And this was absolutely, this was just so funny [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=605.16s)]
*  and insightful and ridiculous. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=608.64s)]
*  Yes. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=610.92s)]
*  Did you know it would have that big of an impact? [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=612.04s)]
*  It has 22 million views. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=614.0s)]
*  Yes, yeah. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=615.24s)]
*  That's, I went into that and I was [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=616.48s)]
*  warned by everyone that I know that not to go on the show. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=621.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=624.44s)]
*  Because at the time with October 7th, [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=625.28s)]
*  there was a certain story and a certain perception [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=628.2s)]
*  and no one was allowed to talk outside of the perception. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=631.72s)]
*  It was all one sided. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=634.24s)]
*  And my wife is half Palestinian [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=636.6800000000001s)]
*  and her family, many of them are in Gaza. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=639.5600000000001s)]
*  And they were bombed and she lost many [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=642.76s)]
*  of her family members all through the years, [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=645.76s)]
*  but it became so natural that Gaza gets bombed [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=648.0s)]
*  that it's crazy that this is a part of their life. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=653.08s)]
*  So we don't even talk about it. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=656.16s)]
*  It's like, yeah. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=657.76s)]
*  We don't, I don't even hear anyone about anybody [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=658.96s)]
*  of her family until a bomb goes on. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=661.92s)]
*  And that's not just like the last eight months. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=664.68s)]
*  I'm talking about like years. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=666.92s)]
*  So when that happened and I saw there's, [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=668.76s)]
*  this is one sided and our, my side of the story [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=671.52s)]
*  is not being allowed to talk, [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=674.12s)]
*  but nobody is willing to listen [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=676.16s)]
*  because everybody was hysterical. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=678.12s)]
*  So when he went in and he said, like, how's everybody? [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=679.92s)]
*  How's your family? [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=682.04s)]
*  It's like, well, I know I tried to kill my life, [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=682.88s)]
*  but she's using my kids as human shields. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=684.12s)]
*  So I use the same stuff that they're using [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=686.84s)]
*  because the way that they were justifying [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=689.6s)]
*  the continuous attack was ridiculous. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=693.28s)]
*  One of them was by Ben Shapiro and even DeSantis. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=695.8s)]
*  He said, well, you know, [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=698.36s)]
*  Israel warns Palestinians before bombing them. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=700.48s)]
*  And I was like, oh my God, how cute. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=704.84s)]
*  Wow, wow, wow. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=705.76s)]
*  So said like, if, so if Putin warns Ukrainians, [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=707.52s)]
*  it's okay for Putin to bomb Ukraine [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=710.32s)]
*  because as long as you warn them, that's fine. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=712.32s)]
*  And I find it's like, and I thought like, [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=714.68s)]
*  I think Israel became so effective of warning them [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=716.8s)]
*  that they actually be like warned them [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=719.44s)]
*  ahead of their funeral. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=721.08s)]
*  They actually been sending flowers to the funeral. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=722.72s)]
*  It's like, we're very sorry for your upcoming loss. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=725.4s)]
*  We're gonna be there in 10. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=728.2s)]
*  I mean, it's like, are you guys gaslighting us? [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=729.56s)]
*  And then I was hearing, oh, there's so many babies we kill, [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=734.88s)]
*  but we cannot help it. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=739.5600000000001s)]
*  What do you mean? [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=741.32s)]
*  If you're the most funded, most advanced, most trained, [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=742.44s)]
*  most supported military in the Middle East [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=745.12s)]
*  and you can't help killing babies, [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=748.12s)]
*  maybe you can stick to your day job. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=750.1600000000001s)]
*  Maybe genocide is not the hobby for you. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=752.0400000000001s)]
*  So it kind of like drew, it was for me, [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=757.4000000000001s)]
*  the justification just drove me crazy. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=761.24s)]
*  So I took every single element that they were taking [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=764.28s)]
*  and I just regurgitated back to them. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=766.44s)]
*  And he said, so what should Israel do? [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=768.32s)]
*  It's like, exactly what they did. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=769.84s)]
*  Kill more people. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=771.0400000000001s)]
*  Why not kill more? [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=771.88s)]
*  Kill more because the whole idea, [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=772.9200000000001s)]
*  if you talk about ceasefire, of please stop in the killing, [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=774.12s)]
*  you have all kinds of arguments not to. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=777.72s)]
*  So all right, let's do whatever you want guys. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=779.96s)]
*  And then show them how ridiculous [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=782.52s)]
*  because this is what comedy does. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=784.0s)]
*  Comedy that is the job of comedy. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=785.5600000000001s)]
*  Comedy doesn't counteract. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=787.0s)]
*  It's like, all right, let's see your idea. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=788.2s)]
*  Let's multiply by hundreds and see how that feels. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=791.52s)]
*  Because it is funny how the most crazy question [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=795.28s)]
*  that they asked me, remember that Theo? [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=799.56s)]
*  What's the proportion response? [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=801.64s)]
*  What's the proportion? [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=803.4s)]
*  How many dead bodies can we get away with? [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=804.4s)]
*  Yeah, what makes things fair? [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=806.3599999999999s)]
*  What's a good number to kill? [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=808.88s)]
*  It's like, I find it very interesting [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=810.3199999999999s)]
*  how the media suddenly is interested in calculus. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=811.88s)]
*  If one Hamas rocket equals 10 Israeli strikes, [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=816.5999999999999s)]
*  how many funerals can we plan for next week? [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=821.2s)]
*  What is this? [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=826.4s)]
*  What is this? [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=827.5600000000001s)]
*  Are there people in Gaza that are consuming your content [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=830.5600000000001s)]
*  that are able, do you think it's bringing some relief? [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=833.48s)]
*  Because I can only imagine. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=835.72s)]
*  If they have some internet. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=837.2s)]
*  Because you understand Gaza is basically, it's sealed off. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=838.5600000000001s)]
*  Even before October 7th forever. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=842.88s)]
*  I love it how he was just like, we left Gaza. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=845.2s)]
*  We're not occupying Gaza anymore. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=848.52s)]
*  Yes, but you're making an embargo of sea and water and land. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=850.9200000000001s)]
*  You cannot give five calories inside [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=854.0400000000001s)]
*  without going through the checkpoint. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=856.5600000000001s)]
*  So it is fine. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=858.36s)]
*  It's like, we're not occupying you, [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=859.8000000000001s)]
*  but we are locking you from outside. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=862.08s)]
*  So when they get internet, sometimes they do. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=865.24s)]
*  And I get a lot of people supporting. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=867.88s)]
*  And someone sent me a video that made me cry. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=869.64s)]
*  In the middle, after Al-Aqbami, they were sitting, kids, [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=872.96s)]
*  and they were playing my video. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=877.5999999999999s)]
*  Somebody downloaded them and they blame my video [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=880.3199999999999s)]
*  on an old television in the rubble. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=882.56s)]
*  And that made me cry. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=885.0s)]
*  So yeah, just so my listeners know, [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=887.3599999999999s)]
*  because a lot of us, we're curious about Israel and Palestine. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=889.5999999999999s)]
*  You hear about it all the time, right? [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=891.9599999999999s)]
*  But some of us, we don't even know what's going on there. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=893.16s)]
*  Because also a lot of the news you get, [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=897.88s)]
*  is this news even accurate? [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=899.7199999999999s)]
*  What filters is the news going through? [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=901.92s)]
*  So what do you feel like is happening [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=903.84s)]
*  between Israel and Palestine? [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=908.32s)]
*  What do you think is happening in Gaza? [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=909.4s)]
*  Is that the question? [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=910.6s)]
*  Yeah, it is a very complicated question. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=911.44s)]
*  Here is a question of the century. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=914.08s)]
*  What's happening there? [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=915.72s)]
*  Well, I don't wanna talk about October 7th, not just now, [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=918.72s)]
*  because things didn't start on October 7th. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=922.8000000000001s)]
*  Yes. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=925.88s)]
*  There is a country called Palestine that's been there. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=926.72s)]
*  And in this piece of land, [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=930.8000000000001s)]
*  many people have went in and out, [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=932.4s)]
*  had kingdoms, have empires, have states, [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=935.24s)]
*  and they were like any other place in the world, right? [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=939.0799999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=941.6s)]
*  So very recently, and I will take, [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=942.92s)]
*  as recent as like 150 years, [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=947.0799999999999s)]
*  there was a promise by the Jewish people in Europe [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=949.1999999999999s)]
*  to have a national state or a home in Palestine. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=951.9599999999999s)]
*  Which was very weird, [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=957.1999999999999s)]
*  because if most of those Jews were in Europe, [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=958.3199999999999s)]
*  and they were persecuted by people in Europe, [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=962.4s)]
*  even before Hitler, there was pogroms all over. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=964.4799999999999s)]
*  And there was like- [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=967.28s)]
*  There were what all over? [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=968.12s)]
*  Pogroms, like kind of like mini Holocaust [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=969.5999999999999s)]
*  where they would like go persecute them, [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=971.52s)]
*  and they would like displace them. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=973.4399999999999s)]
*  Most Jews in Europe didn't have a good life in Europe, [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=976.92s)]
*  especially in Eastern Europe, [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=979.0s)]
*  especially in Ukraine and Russia. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=980.0s)]
*  I know that. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=983.64s)]
*  And yeah, they have pogroms. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=984.4799999999999s)]
*  It's called pogroms all over. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=986.28s)]
*  They have been- [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=987.88s)]
*  Pogroms? [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=988.76s)]
*  Pogroms, pogroms. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=989.5999999999999s)]
*  P-O-G-R-O-M-S. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=990.76s)]
*  Yeah, pogrom right here. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=992.0s)]
*  An organized massacre of a particular ethnic group, [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=993.08s)]
*  in particular that of Jewish people in Russia [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=995.16s)]
*  or Eastern Europe, which you just said. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=997.0400000000001s)]
*  So they have been treated quite nasty in Europe [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=998.6s)]
*  for so many reasons. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1001.88s)]
*  Many of them can actually track it back [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1002.84s)]
*  to the whole sin of Jews killing Jesus. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1005.28s)]
*  And since then, the Catholic Church in Europe [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1008.64s)]
*  and many Christians in Europe have really dealt [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1010.48s)]
*  with Jewish people in a horrible way. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1015.08s)]
*  Yeah, well, you should have killed somebody else, [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1016.76s)]
*  I think because they're gonna hold that against you. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1018.8s)]
*  Some people are. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1021.52s)]
*  You should have killed whoever else was there. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1022.56s)]
*  Or not Jesus, you know what I'm saying? [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1025.04s)]
*  Yeah, I know. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1026.52s)]
*  I don't even know who did or where it was. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1027.36s)]
*  Was it like one of those murder mystery dinners [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1029.2s)]
*  or something like that? [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1032.72s)]
*  No, because it was the new religion [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1033.6399999999999s)]
*  and then there was the whole idea about Jews [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1036.8s)]
*  pushing the Roman ruler to crucify Jews, [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1038.76s)]
*  but that doesn't matter [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1042.12s)]
*  because you shouldn't kill anybody [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1043.32s)]
*  before the sins of their parents. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1045.32s)]
*  But anyways. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1048.08s)]
*  But they picked the wrong guy. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1048.92s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, they picked the son of God. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1050.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1052.32s)]
*  Now I also, but if you're gonna aim, [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1053.1599999999999s)]
*  you wanna, you gotta aim high. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1056.96s)]
*  Can you imagine if they're going with Jesus [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1059.24s)]
*  and then somebody's like, hey, he's been made. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1060.92s)]
*  Guys, he's a made man. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1065.52s)]
*  He's a made man, he is the made man. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1066.36s)]
*  Let's kill the other guy, let's get this other guy. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1068.92s)]
*  So for years and years, he's not going well for them. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1071.08s)]
*  And then after First World War I, [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1073.2s)]
*  there was a promise by the British government [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1076.36s)]
*  to the Jews to establish a home in Palestine. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1078.1599999999999s)]
*  Why did they pick Palestine? [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1082.12s)]
*  Exactly, why? [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1083.36s)]
*  Was there other options that they chose? [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1085.24s)]
*  There was Argentina, Madagascar and Uganda. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1087.08s)]
*  As a matter of fact, the British government [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1094.36s)]
*  gave the Jewish people about 8,000 acres in Uganda [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1096.4399999999998s)]
*  in order to start Rome, [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1100.8799999999999s)]
*  but it was difficult for the Jewish council at the time [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1101.8s)]
*  to design this council at the time [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1107.04s)]
*  to bring people to go to Uganda or to Argentina. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1107.8799999999999s)]
*  It's like, no, the only way that we can do it [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1110.76s)]
*  is to send them to Palestine [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1112.56s)]
*  because it's the holy land, it's the promised land. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1114.1599999999999s)]
*  So did they choose Palestine or the British people are, [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1117.04s)]
*  because this was after World War I, [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1120.6799999999998s)]
*  it was like Britain and America. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1121.84s)]
*  Yeah, in 1917, there's something called [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1123.6399999999999s)]
*  the Balfour Declaration, which was the, [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1125.56s)]
*  it was one of the British government who said, [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1127.6s)]
*  we can give you the state of Palestine as your homeland. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1129.72s)]
*  Okay, bring that up, Nick. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1134.56s)]
*  Before 1917, it was the many, yeah, Balfour Declaration. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1136.56s)]
*  The Balfour Declaration was a public statement [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1140.24s)]
*  issued by the British government in 1917 [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1141.76s)]
*  during the First World War, [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1143.84s)]
*  announcing its support of the establishment [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1144.8799999999999s)]
*  of a national home for the Jewish people in Palestine, [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1146.48s)]
*  then an Ottoman region [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1149.84s)]
*  with a small minority of Jewish population. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1150.9199999999998s)]
*  I like your fact checking everything [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1153.04s)]
*  and it's coming great. [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1154.8s)]
*  Well, I just, this is good [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1156.9199999999998s)]
*  because I always wonder some little things [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1158.0s)]
*  and I know little things, but I don't know enough. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1160.48s)]
*  But before 1917, there was other trials [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1162.6s)]
*  or other options for the countries I told you. [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1164.84s)]
*  And you know what's the kicker? [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1168.52s)]
*  That's funny. [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1169.48s)]
*  Many Orthodox Jewish rabbis [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1170.8799999999999s)]
*  objected for Palestine to be the homeland [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1175.24s)]
*  because in their Jewish faith, [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1177.48s)]
*  we cannot have a land for Israel until the Messiah, [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1179.4399999999998s)]
*  the real Messiah, because they don't believe in Jesus, [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1182.9599999999998s)]
*  their Messiah would come. [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1185.28s)]
*  So they were a huge opposition [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1187.36s)]
*  for having a land of Israel in Palestine. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1190.48s)]
*  Because it was a... [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1194.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1195.96s)]
*  Because it was a... [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1196.8s)]
*  Because it was not the time yet. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1197.6399999999999s)]
*  It should wait until the Messiah to come [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1200.12s)]
*  and then that will create the land of Israel. [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1203.6s)]
*  Oh, I see. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1206.08s)]
*  So wherever the Messiah showed up, [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1206.9199999999998s)]
*  that would be the land of Israel. [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1208.24s)]
*  But the secular Zionists at the time, [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1209.24s)]
*  they said like, okay, how about we build the land [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1210.96s)]
*  and that will force him to come. [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1213.84s)]
*  So kind of like build it and they will come. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1215.28s)]
*  How about that? [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1217.08s)]
*  So you understand that? [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1218.6399999999999s)]
*  Like field of dreams kind of. [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1220.2s)]
*  Because here's the thing, [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1221.76s)]
*  because many of the people who talk about [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1222.6s)]
*  Israel as being like a biblical promise, [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1225.0s)]
*  even they were not having a consensus [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1226.0s)]
*  of where should we have. [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1228.88s)]
*  So whoever tells you, oh, it's consensus, it's divine. [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1231.2s)]
*  No, they even had problems deciding. [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1233.68s)]
*  So anyways, and at that time, [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1235.52s)]
*  especially 1930s after Hitler came to power, [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1238.24s)]
*  there were like droves and droves and droves [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1242.0s)]
*  of Jewish Germans and Jewish Polish people [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1244.0800000000002s)]
*  and Jewish Russians, they were like having, [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1246.48s)]
*  they went into refugee boats and they came to Palestine. [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1249.16s)]
*  And you know why? [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1252.52s)]
*  Because they were not granted visas by the United States. [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1253.3999999999999s)]
*  They were not granted visas by other European countries. [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1256.36s)]
*  Wow, so a lot of Jewish, like German Jews, Polish Jews, [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1259.1599999999999s)]
*  they weren't granted visas by? [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1262.7199999999998s)]
*  The West. [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1264.8s)]
*  By the West, but they were by Palestine. [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1265.6399999999999s)]
*  And Palestinians didn't have anything [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1267.84s)]
*  because it was a mandate by the British. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1269.6s)]
*  They were occupying that land, [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1271.36s)]
*  but they were Palestinian people. [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1272.6799999999998s)]
*  So this became the myth of a land with no people [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1274.24s)]
*  to the people with no land. [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1278.12s)]
*  And if you actually find that, [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1279.28s)]
*  you will actually find that thing. [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1282.44s)]
*  This was one of the myth, a land with no people [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1283.92s)]
*  to the people with no land. [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1286.2s)]
*  So they will tell people, [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1287.52s)]
*  hey, there was no people living there, so it is ours. [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1288.44s)]
*  It is just a desert, but it was never a desert. [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1292.44s)]
*  There were like more than 1.2 million Palestinians [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1295.88s)]
*  living in that area, a piece of land. [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1298.92s)]
*  Before the Balfour Declaration. [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1301.4s)]
*  Before the Balfour Declaration. [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1302.88s)]
*  Then Jewish people came in, [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1304.3600000000001s)]
*  and then many of those Jewish European residents [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1306.3200000000002s)]
*  started to form militias. [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1309.8s)]
*  And armed gangs. [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1313.08s)]
*  The Haganah, the Ergon, the Stein. [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1314.64s)]
*  Now were these Jewish people that had just been rescued [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1320.2s)]
*  from the Nazi Germany? [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1323.24s)]
*  From Nazi Germany, yes. [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1326.44s)]
*  Okay. [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1327.28s)]
*  The 1930s all the way to the Second World War. [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1328.1s)]
*  So they started to move to Palestine. [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1329.76s)]
*  Yes. [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1331.36s)]
*  Which is now Palestine and Israel. [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1332.2s)]
*  What was it called at that point? [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1333.52s)]
*  It was all called Palestine. [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1334.64s)]
*  Even after Israel was given the land? [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1336.64s)]
*  It was after they were given the promise. [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1339.0s)]
*  The promise. [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1340.76s)]
*  If you read it, it was giving a promise [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1341.6s)]
*  to make the land in the land of Palestine. [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1343.28s)]
*  I see. [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1345.12s)]
*  So even many of those Israelis had Palestinian passports. [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1345.9599999999998s)]
*  So the land was called Palestine. [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1348.9599999999998s)]
*  And there were Palestinian people living there. [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1350.52s)]
*  1.2 million at least. [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1352.36s)]
*  Fast forward, I'm not gonna go into so many details. [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1355.1999999999998s)]
*  But I fast forward 1948. [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1357.8s)]
*  1947, 48, there was like many wars happening. [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1359.7199999999998s)]
*  Many wars happening. [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1363.9599999999998s)]
*  Many, many attacks between the Palestinian and the Jews. [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1364.8s)]
*  Because the Palestinians said like, [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1368.9199999999998s)]
*  you're coming from Europe and you're taking our land. [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1369.96s)]
*  It's like, no, this is our biblical land. [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1371.96s)]
*  Now it's ours. [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1373.44s)]
*  And those Jews were like supported pretty much [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1375.4s)]
*  by the British and the American. [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1378.28s)]
*  You think that's like, oh, we don't want them back. [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1380.3600000000001s)]
*  So take all the weapons and stay there. [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1382.48s)]
*  So, and then there were a declaration, [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1384.64s)]
*  a UN declaration, a partition. [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1387.8000000000002s)]
*  It's called a partition, 1947. [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1389.52s)]
*  And they gave the Jews who were less than 30%, [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1392.0s)]
*  more than half of the land. [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1394.88s)]
*  Okay. [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1396.4s)]
*  And they gave the Jew, the Palestinians [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1397.24s)]
*  who were much more like 45, 49%. [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1398.64s)]
*  And who did, who was helping dictate that? [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1402.48s)]
*  Who was helping, not dictated, [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1404.16s)]
*  but who was helping like facilitate it? [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1405.3200000000002s)]
*  Well, after first, second world war, after 1945, [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1407.64s)]
*  the British and the Americans were like [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1410.64s)]
*  kind of the world superpower. [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1413.2800000000002s)]
*  Right. [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1414.4s)]
*  So they were, at the time I think it was- [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1415.24s)]
*  They were running the chess board. [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1417.0400000000002s)]
*  I think it was Truman. [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1417.88s)]
*  It was Truman in power who basically pushed. [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1419.76s)]
*  And there's like a video, black and white video [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1423.0400000000002s)]
*  for Truman describing, it's like, [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1425.4s)]
*  we were trying to please everybody, [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1429.4s)]
*  but it was difficult because we were putting them people [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1430.48s)]
*  into other people land and it's there in black and white. [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1433.48s)]
*  So, so that I'm why I'm telling, giving this [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1435.76s)]
*  because the, yeah, these ideas, see? [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1438.24s)]
*  Former president Henry Toome talks about [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1441.24s)]
*  generic power in the middle East. [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1442.68s)]
*  It is just like, if you watch them, [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1444.2s)]
*  especially the one in front of the map. [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1446.68s)]
*  Yeah, the one in front of the map. [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1449.92s)]
*  The two on the front of the map, you know? [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1450.76s)]
*  Lawyer Anderson was one of them. [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1454.36s)]
*  We had several other people in the country, [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1456.2s)]
*  even among the Jews, the Zionists particularly, [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1459.24s)]
*  who were against anything that was to be done [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1461.92s)]
*  if they couldn't have the whole of Palestine [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1464.28s)]
*  and everything handed to them on a silver plate [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1466.3600000000001s)]
*  so they wouldn't have to do anything. [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1469.0s)]
*  It couldn't be done. [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1470.72s)]
*  We had to take it in small doses. [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1471.68s)]
*  You can't move five or six million people out of a country [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1473.72s)]
*  and fill it up with five or six million more [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1478.0800000000002s)]
*  and expect both sets of them to be pleased. [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1480.1200000000001s)]
*  We had all sorts of- [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1482.56s)]
*  So you see, and I'm really talking about this [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1485.08s)]
*  because if you wanna talk about October 17th, [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1488.1599999999999s)]
*  you need to talk about the basis [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1490.24s)]
*  because they will always get like a point of time. [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1491.84s)]
*  The basis of this, this was a land of Palestinian people. [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1495.76s)]
*  People from Europe came in and they started to import [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1499.56s)]
*  other Jews from the other parts of Arab countries. [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1502.28s)]
*  And they said, this is our land now [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1505.52s)]
*  for whatever biblical reason. [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1507.1999999999998s)]
*  Because this doesn't make any sense. [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1509.04s)]
*  This is like me coming into your podcast studio. [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1510.6799999999998s)]
*  And I said, like, hey, my fortune cookie told me [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1513.3999999999999s)]
*  that this is mine now and I'm allowed to kill you. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1515.28s)]
*  I don't care about what your Bible or Torah or Quran [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1518.04s)]
*  tells you if you have a holy scripture good for you, [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1521.36s)]
*  but that doesn't dictate political decision [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1524.7199999999998s)]
*  that can affect the lives of other people in the region. [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1526.9599999999998s)]
*  So this is exactly what happened. [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1530.0s)]
*  And what drives me crazy is that we hear the whole idea [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1531.4799999999998s)]
*  about like the chosen people or the chosen people [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1534.28s)]
*  or the chosen people. [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1536.08s)]
*  Okay, fine, you think your chosen people good for you. [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1536.9199999999998s)]
*  Everybody think they're chosen. [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1539.04s)]
*  Christian think they're chosen. [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1540.28s)]
*  Muslim think they're chosen. [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1541.52s)]
*  But what drives me crazy is the Christian Zionist. [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1543.0s)]
*  The pro-Israel Christian Zionist [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1545.4s)]
*  who say that they are chosen, that the Jews are chosen. [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1547.92s)]
*  And I'm sorry to say, isn't Jesus your guy? [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1552.72s)]
*  Are you in an open relationship? [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1556.6s)]
*  He was, yeah, he was. [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1557.92s)]
*  Are you in an open relationship? [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1559.16s)]
*  Like, how come you believe in a religion, [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1560.96s)]
*  in a nagad, in a doctrine, but you believe that other people [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1564.32s)]
*  from another religion are chosen over you? [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1566.96s)]
*  Don't you feel unchosen? [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1568.88s)]
*  I mean, this is like a religious polygamy, right? [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1570.44s)]
*  Are you cheating on Jesus? [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1573.1599999999999s)]
*  Is this some sort of a religious form? [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1574.76s)]
*  It doesn't make any sense. [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1576.8799999999999s)]
*  And I'm sick and tired of this whole idea [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1578.1999999999998s)]
*  about chosen people. [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1580.0s)]
*  What does it mean to be chosen? [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1580.84s)]
*  Do you have a bottle service? [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1581.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1583.0s)]
*  Do you have like a VIP lounge access? [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1583.84s)]
*  Are you like in a waterfront condos [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1585.36s)]
*  and we were like back in the purgatory in our city. [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1587.1599999999999s)]
*  Like, well, at times you're advertising. [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1589.84s)]
*  I know. [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1591.6799999999998s)]
*  It's really great advertising [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1592.52s)]
*  if you just say you're the chosen people. [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1593.7199999999998s)]
*  How did that term come about, I wonder? [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1595.8s)]
*  It was in their Bible, in their Torah. [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1599.8s)]
*  But it's fine because everybody thinks they're chosen. [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1602.24s)]
*  Everybody wants to think they're chosen. [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1604.4s)]
*  That is the driving force of faith. [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1605.24s)]
*  That I'm the only one in heaven [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1607.16s)]
*  and everybody's gonna go to hell. [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1608.72s)]
*  But I don't understand if they're saying [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1610.36s)]
*  that they're chosen, why the Christian Zionists believe that? [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1612.44s)]
*  So what is a Zionist? [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1615.28s)]
*  A Zionist, okay, there's a Zionist. [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1617.1200000000001s)]
*  They would want you to believe that the Zionists [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1619.84s)]
*  simply believe that having a national statehood [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1622.08s)]
*  for Jewish people. [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1625.0s)]
*  But that's more than that. [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1626.4s)]
*  Zionist is a... [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1627.36s)]
*  Are Zionists Jewish or are they? [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1629.96s)]
*  Not necessarily because you can be Zionist [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1632.1200000000001s)]
*  and still Christian or a Zionist or an atheist [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1634.44s)]
*  because many of the pros... [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1638.3600000000001s)]
*  That's why I don't say Jews. [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1641.3600000000001s)]
*  I don't say, but I say pro-Zionist or pro-Israel [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1642.7600000000002s)]
*  because many of the people in Congress are Christians [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1645.8000000000002s)]
*  and they just believe in Zionism. [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1649.8400000000001s)]
*  And Zionism here, as we believe it from an Arab perspective, [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1652.16s)]
*  it is a colonial settling idea of ideology [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1655.88s)]
*  that is based on cleansing the whole group of people [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1659.48s)]
*  out of their land and you coming into... [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1662.92s)]
*  If you wanna have like a national state, that's fine, [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1664.96s)]
*  but you understand they are building it [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1669.0s)]
*  on the state of other people. [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1670.52s)]
*  You're coming in and you're doing it. [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1671.92s)]
*  And just to give you a very, very small snippet [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1673.32s)]
*  of the magnitude of what happened. [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1675.8s)]
*  1948, 15th of May, the day that Israel declared independence. [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1678.24s)]
*  On that day, overnight, 750,000 Palestinians, [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1683.08s)]
*  three quarters of a million were displaced overnight. [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1689.04s)]
*  Overnight, displaced from their village, [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1692.24s)]
*  displaced from their homes, displaced from their cities. [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1694.4399999999998s)]
*  They were killing, raping, they were burning, [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1696.96s)]
*  all kinds of things. [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1700.1599999999999s)]
*  And you have documentaries where Israeli soldiers, [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1701.0s)]
*  they talk, braggingly talk about like the atrocities [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1705.52s)]
*  that they did and the rape and the women that they raped [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1708.1999999999998s)]
*  and all of that happened. [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1710.52s)]
*  And was that... [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1711.6799999999998s)]
*  Yeah, so this is a perfect example. [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1713.3999999999999s)]
*  Okay. [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1715.1999999999998s)]
*  You see, this is 1946 Palestine. [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1716.04s)]
*  This is all Palestine with a little of like Jewish spots [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1718.16s)]
*  here and there. [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1722.0800000000002s)]
*  And this is the UN partition. [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1723.0s)]
*  Suddenly, the UN gave all of that white space to Israel. [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1724.4s)]
*  So the Palestinians are like, wait a minute, [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1730.0800000000002s)]
*  that doesn't work. [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1732.1200000000001s)]
*  But how were they lobbying like the UN? [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1733.44s)]
*  Is the UN the group that was doing it? [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1739.68s)]
*  No, no, but you have to understand, [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1740.5200000000002s)]
*  like UN has no power. [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1741.72s)]
*  Okay, got it. [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1742.92s)]
*  Who has the power? [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1743.76s)]
*  America and England. [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1744.5800000000002s)]
*  America and England. [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1745.76s)]
*  And the UN now, America runs the world. [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1746.6s)]
*  So America is the superpower, [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1751.1599999999999s)]
*  especially after the second world war, [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1752.4399999999998s)]
*  they are the strongest country. [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1754.04s)]
*  They are the strongest I've ever been. [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1755.36s)]
*  They just like bomb, like drop two nuclear weapons [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1756.1999999999998s)]
*  and bombs. [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1759.3999999999999s)]
*  So they had women playing baseball at that time. [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1760.24s)]
*  Even Henry Truman's like, we tried, [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1762.7199999999998s)]
*  but like we're trying to do it, but it's difficult. [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1764.8799999999999s)]
*  But it's hard. [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1767.1599999999999s)]
*  So this is, you see how it went from here to here [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1768.0s)]
*  in less than 50 years. [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1770.9599999999998s)]
*  How now the Palestinian state, quote unquote state, [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1773.92s)]
*  have become just like islands and islands and islands. [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1777.0s)]
*  And so you had 1.2 million. [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1780.6000000000001s)]
*  Now you have, you see this little green thing? [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1783.52s)]
*  You have more than 5 million Palestinians living there, [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1786.0800000000002s)]
*  crushed into these little things. [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1790.28s)]
*  Gaza, which is the little strip on the side, [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1792.04s)]
*  it has 2.2 million people. [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1794.3600000000001s)]
*  And those 2.2 million people were not born in Gaza. [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1795.8400000000001s)]
*  More than three quarters of them came from outside, [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1798.3400000000001s)]
*  but they were pushing them, pushing them, pushing. [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1800.64s)]
*  So we understand this is the state now. [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1802.56s)]
*  So the basis of all of this is occupation. [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1804.96s)]
*  I see. [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1808.04s)]
*  That's why when they tell you [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1808.8799999999999s)]
*  that Israel has the right to defend itself, [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1809.7s)]
*  and people say the unoccupying force [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1811.9199999999998s)]
*  has no right to defend itself [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1814.2s)]
*  against the people that they occupy. [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1815.44s)]
*  This is- [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1817.96s)]
*  Say that again to me, Bassem. [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1818.8s)]
*  So if you are an occupying force, [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1819.6399999999999s)]
*  you have no right to defend yourself. [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1821.3999999999999s)]
*  Because you cannot, it's like, [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1823.1599999999999s)]
*  does the Nazi Germany has a right to defend itself [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1825.0s)]
*  against the French resistance? [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1828.0s)]
*  You can't. [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1830.2s)]
*  You went into their country. [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1831.02s)]
*  With might and with force and with military. [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1832.76s)]
*  You occupy them. [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1835.72s)]
*  You get them. [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1837.0s)]
*  And this is why, I never want to tell you, [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1837.8400000000001s)]
*  how come they, if you did October 7th, [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1840.28s)]
*  you should expect that, well, before October 7th, [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1842.0800000000002s)]
*  it's been going on and on and on every single day. [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1844.64s)]
*  A Palestinian will wake up in the morning [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1846.92s)]
*  and an Israeli soldier or Israeli settle [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1849.8000000000002s)]
*  can go into their house, burn their house, [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1852.52s)]
*  take their house, kill them, take them as hostages, [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1854.88s)]
*  put them in prison, say that they are terrorists. [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1857.4s)]
*  And a lot of people talk about the Israeli hostages. [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1860.08s)]
*  You understand, but before October 7th, [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1864.6s)]
*  there are 5,000 Palestinian hostages in prisons. [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1866.08s)]
*  One of every five Palestinian has been put in jail. [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1870.8s)]
*  You understand? [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1874.52s)]
*  So put that in perspective. [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1875.36s)]
*  America has 330 million people? [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1876.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1879.96s)]
*  So- [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1880.8s)]
*  Some people are missing. [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1881.6399999999999s)]
*  How many people are missing? [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1882.8799999999999s)]
*  300. [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1883.72s)]
*  So imagine, if imagine, imagine out of those, [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1885.02s)]
*  about 65 million Americans is in jail right now. [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1889.52s)]
*  This is the reality of Palestinians. [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1893.48s)]
*  So at a certain point, [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1897.0s)]
*  if I'm talking to people who are listening to us now, [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1898.2s)]
*  you have a farm, you have a land, [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1900.66s)]
*  you have your cows, your herds, your family. [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1902.0s)]
*  Imagine for 75 years, your house has no privacy. [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1906.16s)]
*  Your family has no sanctity. [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1912.1200000000001s)]
*  Yeah, you can't go to sleep knowing [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1915.2s)]
*  that you're gonna wake up [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1916.44s)]
*  and your house will be yours in the morning. [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1917.28s)]
*  You go in, people take them, being pushed out, [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1918.48s)]
*  they take their land. [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1921.4s)]
*  At a certain point, you have to break. [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1922.52s)]
*  You have to snap. [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1924.4s)]
*  So you're saying that what happened on October 7th [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1925.3600000000001s)]
*  is just a buildup of a long series of things. [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1927.48s)]
*  That's just a pinpoint. [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1930.28s)]
*  And it's not new. [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1931.3600000000001s)]
*  I know a lot of people say, [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1932.44s)]
*  I'll give an example, 2014, exactly 10 years ago, [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1934.08s)]
*  in Gaza, 2,200 Palestinians were killed, [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1936.3600000000001s)]
*  dead, 500 children killed. [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1939.34s)]
*  There was no October 7th. [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1941.3600000000001s)]
*  You understand? [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1942.76s)]
*  There was no October 7th. [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1943.6s)]
*  But they go in because it, [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1944.56s)]
*  and I gave this example to Chris Cuomo once. [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1946.3600000000001s)]
*  Israel is like, Palestine, Gaza, and West Bank [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1948.72s)]
*  is like a small fishbowl. [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1953.88s)]
*  And you have the power to go into this fishbowl [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1955.92s)]
*  and you just kick the shit out of those fish [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1958.32s)]
*  any time you want. [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1962.44s)]
*  At a certain point, one fish will be crazy enough, [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1963.68s)]
*  suicide enough, to jump from the fishbowl [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1966.0800000000002s)]
*  and bite your pinky. [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1968.4s)]
*  That's October 7th. [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1970.2s)]
*  So you're going, oh, I'm gonna destroy, [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1971.3600000000001s)]
*  it's already destroyed. [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1972.6000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, you're creating piranhas. [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1974.16s)]
*  You understand that in just eight months, [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1976.32s)]
*  Israel have bombed Gaza more than America has bombed [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1979.84s)]
*  Iraq for eight years. [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1982.8799999999999s)]
*  Wow. [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1985.68s)]
*  In eight months. [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1986.52s)]
*  You don't do that. [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1987.36s)]
*  You don't do that. [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1989.8s)]
*  And of course they tell you, oh, it's collateral damage. [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1990.6399999999999s)]
*  Which is crazy, right? [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1992.56s)]
*  It's like, oh, those people that died, [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1993.8799999999999s)]
*  it's collateral damage. [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1995.68s)]
*  We really wanted to take that terrorist, [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1997.0s)]
*  but the school got in the way. [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=1998.6s)]
*  I mean, the geography is very hostile. [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=2000.3799999999999s)]
*  Every time we kill Hamas, [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=2002.6s)]
*  just like schools and babies come out of nowhere. [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=2005.0s)]
*  It's like, I shouldn't be laughing at this. [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=2009.48s)]
*  I know. [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=2011.44s)]
*  I mean, it's dark because sometimes I feel [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=2012.28s)]
*  that Israel has some sort of a program [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=2014.1200000000001s)]
*  called No Civilian Left Behind. [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=2015.88s)]
*  You know, it's like, it doesn't matter [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=2017.76s)]
*  if you're a little kid playing soccer or a Hamas terrorist, [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=2019.3600000000001s)]
*  you get a piece of the action. [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=2022.3600000000001s)]
*  It's like, you understand. [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=2025.96s)]
*  It's like favorite nations. [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=2027.8s)]
*  Because I, as an Arab, I have no power. [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=2029.04s)]
*  I'm not powerful as the United States, [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=2032.1200000000001s)]
*  I'm not powerful as Israel. [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=2033.4s)]
*  So all I have to do is just laugh at this. [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=2034.76s)]
*  Because that doesn't work. [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=2036.8s)]
*  So back to 1948, they displaced 75, [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=2038.84s)]
*  they had 750,000 people, [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=2041.96s)]
*  and they continued to occupy the land every single day. [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=2044.04s)]
*  So you said that in 1948, what was that movement called? [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=2046.52s)]
*  And that was just like in one day it kind of happened? [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=2049.24s)]
*  Yeah, that is the establishment [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=2051.04s)]
*  of the state of Israel in 1948, 15th of May, 1948. [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=2053.44s)]
*  Okay, and so when Israel established itself, [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=2056.64s)]
*  and were they, is Israel able to establish itself by itself, [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=2059.04s)]
*  or did they have to have support from Britain and America? [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=2062.14s)]
*  Well, Israel didn't establish itself over one day. [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=2066.06s)]
*  I mean, they've been doing it, [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=2068.98s)]
*  they're having, pushing people into it from other countries, [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=2070.14s)]
*  and actually they had a lot of support from England [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=2074.3399999999997s)]
*  and from America. [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=2078.7s)]
*  And I find it very interesting how that Israelis [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=2081.8199999999997s)]
*  made Americans think that terrorism is something [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=2085.1s)]
*  that has been invented by Arabs or Muslims. [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=2089.02s)]
*  Because if you talk to anybody, terrorism, oh, Arabs, Muslims, [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=2091.82s)]
*  you know that the first terrorist attack ever [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=2095.2200000000003s)]
*  in the Middle East was carried out by Israel. [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=2097.5800000000004s)]
*  1946, in July, Israel bombed King David Hotel, [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=2100.38s)]
*  killing 91 British soldiers, 91. [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=2104.54s)]
*  That is the first, and it was led by a Stern gang, [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=2107.94s)]
*  which is Itzhak Shamir, who later became [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=2111.82s)]
*  the Prime Minister of Israel. [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=2114.78s)]
*  So they have been killing people, [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=2116.6200000000003s)]
*  they have been terrorizing people all throughout, [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=2119.6200000000003s)]
*  and they call Palestinians terrorists. [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=2121.3s)]
*  And when that, so when that one day comes, [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=2123.9s)]
*  the establishment of Israel as a country, [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=2125.7400000000002s)]
*  is it like a certain, at that day, [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=2127.7400000000002s)]
*  is there just like a mass where everybody has to move [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=2129.6200000000003s)]
*  out of this space, and this is ours, and this is yours? [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=2131.7000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, they basically move them into, [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=2133.5400000000004s)]
*  if you go and get back the map, [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=2134.38s)]
*  they move them into the West Bank and Gaza, [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=2135.3s)]
*  and then in that map that we've been, yeah, [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=2138.42s)]
*  and you see the third one, yeah. [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=2140.9s)]
*  So now all of the Palestinians are into this. [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=2142.82s)]
*  1967, we go to war with Israel, [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=2145.6200000000003s)]
*  Egypt goes to war, get its ass kicked, [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=2149.06s)]
*  because we had Nasser messing up big time. [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=2150.94s)]
*  In 1967, Egypt went to war? [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=2152.98s)]
*  Yeah, with, and then Israel. [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=2155.22s)]
*  With who, with Palestine? [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=2157.02s)]
*  With Israel. [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=2157.86s)]
*  With Israel. [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=2158.7s)]
*  And then after that, Israel could actually [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=2159.54s)]
*  completely control the West Bank and Gaza. [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=2161.78s)]
*  I see. [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=2164.38s)]
*  So now, this is under, so what you could see [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=2165.22s)]
*  in all of these green marks is an occupation. [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=2167.74s)]
*  And let me say it again, it's an occupation. [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=2171.22s)]
*  It's a military force that is occupying people, [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=2173.9s)]
*  and it is an occupation because of a land [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=2176.94s)]
*  that has been disintegrated from this to this. [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=2179.66s)]
*  So was, so you're saying that the, [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=2182.9s)]
*  it wasn't, the occupation, it was by force, [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=2185.62s)]
*  it was never by like agreement. [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=2189.46s)]
*  Yeah, how can you agree to just like this? [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=2191.46s)]
*  Wait, is there a lease? [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=2193.3s)]
*  Like what does the lease say? [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=2194.14s)]
*  The what? [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=2195.54s)]
*  The lease. [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=2196.38s)]
*  The lease. [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=2197.2200000000003s)]
*  The lease. [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=2198.06s)]
*  There's no lease when you occupy, [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=2198.9s)]
*  what did the lease say in France when Nassy came in, [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=2200.5s)]
*  when Nassy came in and took over your land? [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=2203.58s)]
*  You have nothing to say. [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=2205.42s)]
*  You have people coming in with the. [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=2206.66s)]
*  Most Jewish people I know are landlords, you know? [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=2208.86s)]
*  So it's like, I can't imagine they would do this [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=2210.78s)]
*  without a lease. [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=2213.54s)]
*  Well, if you have an army next to you, [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=2214.38s)]
*  why would you need a lease? [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=2216.5s)]
*  Because till today, till today, like you have, [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=2217.98s)]
*  go into the internet and find just like Israeli settlers, [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=2222.06s)]
*  terrorizing Palestinian farmers, just random thing. [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=2227.54s)]
*  You have like a hundred videos. [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=2232.14s)]
*  It happens every single day. [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=2233.46s)]
*  And this is why I'm talking because everybody is focused [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=2236.1000000000004s)]
*  on this little strip, on the Gaza Strip. [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=2238.1400000000003s)]
*  But people don't know what is happening [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=2240.1800000000003s)]
*  in those green scattered. [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=2242.1000000000004s)]
*  This is happening every single day. [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=2244.5s)]
*  Every single day people, by the way, [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=2246.1800000000003s)]
*  the hostages are not 5,000 people anymore. [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=2249.7400000000002s)]
*  After October 7th, it's now 12,000 people. [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=2252.0200000000004s)]
*  12,000 Palestinians in prisons. [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=2254.3s)]
*  In prisons. [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=2256.78s)]
*  So when you talk about hostages, [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=2257.9s)]
*  and I just wanna get people back October 7th. [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=2259.94s)]
*  When Hamas did this, and I'm not defending Hamas, [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=2262.26s)]
*  I'm not into any kind of support of any group. [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=2264.1s)]
*  But they said, we will release the hostage [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=2268.38s)]
*  if you release our hostages. [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=2270.46s)]
*  Because you have been going into our houses [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=2271.98s)]
*  and taking people, half of the 5,000 people [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=2274.22s)]
*  that I told you about, half of them are women and children. [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=2276.94s)]
*  Half of them. [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=2279.42s)]
*  And then they, and I'll just give you an example [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=2280.2599999999998s)]
*  because I know what will people tell you, [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=2282.94s)]
*  oh, but these are terrorists. [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=2284.7799999999997s)]
*  I'll give you an example of a terrorist. [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=2286.02s)]
*  Suad Zuraikat, she is a Palestinian mother. [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=2288.66s)]
*  So you have to say it slower. [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=2291.02s)]
*  Suad Zuraikat. [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=2291.98s)]
*  She's a Palestinian mother. [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=2294.18s)]
*  Her husband was killed. [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=2295.98s)]
*  And then she wrote on Facebook, may God unite us in heaven. [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=2298.8599999999997s)]
*  The Israeli authority considered that as an incitement [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=2302.2999999999997s)]
*  for terrorism, and they took her and they put her [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=2306.98s)]
*  in detention for eight months. [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=2309.06s)]
*  That's the kind of people that they will take you [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=2310.54s)]
*  for terrorism, all right? [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=2312.1s)]
*  And I'm not saying that there's violence, [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=2314.1s)]
*  but put yourself in their place. [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=2315.8199999999997s)]
*  Your house is being taken, your farms are being burned, [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=2317.8199999999997s)]
*  your cattle is being killed, [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=2320.2599999999998s)]
*  your kids are being taken in front of you, [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=2321.7s)]
*  your woman, your husband, your wife may be even raped [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=2324.02s)]
*  and taken away and sexually molested. [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=2327.82s)]
*  How long can you keep going? [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=2331.02s)]
*  Because, but we want peace. [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=2333.54s)]
*  This is not a peace, this is subjugation. [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=2335.62s)]
*  So you're saying that over time, [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=2337.58s)]
*  it's like a slow devouring of the Palestinian people [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=2339.06s)]
*  is kind of what's happened. [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=2342.62s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, it is devouring. [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=2343.46s)]
*  As you said, they devour the land, [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=2345.2200000000003s)]
*  they devour their lives, they are dehumanized. [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=2347.26s)]
*  And when you fight back, you're called a terrorist. [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=2350.2599999999998s)]
*  Now, let's go back to October 7th [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=2353.5s)]
*  because this is very important. [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=2355.2999999999997s)]
*  Okay. [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=2356.7s)]
*  October 7th, Hamas, which is a militant group [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=2357.54s)]
*  that is living in Gaza, that has won the election [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=2360.62s)]
*  in 2006, but they were never allowed to take power [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=2363.74s)]
*  because Israel started bombing them. [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=2367.62s)]
*  Okay, so Hamas was actually an elected group. [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=2369.58s)]
*  Yeah. Okay. [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=2372.06s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=2372.8999999999996s)]
*  And when they ran for election, what were they like? [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=2373.74s)]
*  They were running as a group. [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=2376.2599999999998s)]
*  I mean, Hamas is a, [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=2378.66s)]
*  they don't like the Palestinian authority [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=2381.06s)]
*  that was already there. [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=2383.06s)]
*  They didn't like them? [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=2383.98s)]
*  They didn't like them. [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=2384.8199999999997s)]
*  Okay. [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=2385.66s)]
*  And Israel, Netanyahu, was so happy with that [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=2386.5s)]
*  and they started to give money to Hamas [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=2389.06s)]
*  in order to bolster them and make them stronger. [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=2391.62s)]
*  And he said in the Likud party, in his party, he said, [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=2394.3799999999997s)]
*  the only way to prevent a Palestinian state [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=2398.3399999999997s)]
*  is to make the Palestinian factions fighting the whole time. [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=2400.8199999999997s)]
*  He said that. [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=2404.3399999999997s)]
*  So he created a monster. [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=2405.18s)]
*  So he saw that, so you're saying that Netanyahu, [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=2406.66s)]
*  who is the president of Israel, [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=2410.18s)]
*  or the prime minister, he saw that, okay, [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=2412.62s)]
*  there's this alternative group, Hamas, [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=2415.46s)]
*  who is causing conflict with the people [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=2417.66s)]
*  who are in charge in Palestine. [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=2422.2599999999998s)]
*  And so I'm gonna fund Hamas. [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=2423.7799999999997s)]
*  Yes, and Hamas was, I wouldn't say that they were moderate. [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=2425.3799999999997s)]
*  They would say like, we want to eradicate Israel, whatever. [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=2428.2999999999997s)]
*  And then they kind of revised their charter, [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=2430.98s)]
*  but they weren't fans of each other. [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=2433.18s)]
*  And did Israel definitely fund them? [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=2438.4199999999996s)]
*  You have Netanyahu on tape actually confessing, [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=2441.8999999999996s)]
*  facilitating their support many times. [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=2447.14s)]
*  And you can look it up if you want. [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=2451.22s)]
*  It's like, what I'm trying to say is [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=2453.06s)]
*  they won the election 2006 and Israel didn't like it [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=2456.2599999999998s)]
*  and then they started bombing and then Israel. [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=2460.7799999999997s)]
*  Who won, Hamas? [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=2462.26s)]
*  Hamas won by 51% in Gaza. [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=2463.94s)]
*  But then they were in fighting and it didn't work. [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=2466.78s)]
*  And then Israel kind of created even a bigger embargo. [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=2470.0200000000004s)]
*  And then for the past 20 years, [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=2473.7400000000002s)]
*  they've just been going every time Hamas retaliates, [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=2476.34s)]
*  Israel retaliates and they retaliate and they retaliate, [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=2479.98s)]
*  but who has the power, who has the military might? [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=2482.78s)]
*  It's Israel. [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=2484.46s)]
*  At the end of the day, it's militants. [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=2485.3s)]
*  Oh yeah, Israel is a superpower. [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=2486.9s)]
*  Yeah, so you cannot just cry, [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=2488.98s)]
*  oh, we're gonna perish because of a militant group. [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=2491.26s)]
*  If we're giving you that money, that doesn't work this way. [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=2494.46s)]
*  But here's what I want to talk about, [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=2498.38s)]
*  which is the most important thing about October 7th, [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=2499.82s)]
*  which I find there is like a big failure [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=2504.1000000000004s)]
*  of the American media. [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=2505.6600000000003s)]
*  When October 7th happened, [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=2508.5800000000004s)]
*  everybody was talking about raping women, [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=2509.86s)]
*  decapitating children, putting women in the oven. [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=2512.42s)]
*  Even Anthony Blinken, the Secretary of State, [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=2515.46s)]
*  he went into Congress and he described this scene [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=2518.3s)]
*  about Hamas militants going into a house, [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=2522.1s)]
*  raping the woman, blinding the father, [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=2524.4199999999996s)]
*  cutting the limb of a child, [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=2527.54s)]
*  cutting a finger of another child [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=2529.94s)]
*  and then cutting the chest, the breast of a woman [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=2531.5s)]
*  and playing football with it and raping it. [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=2534.2599999999998s)]
*  And I say, wait a minute, [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=2537.2999999999997s)]
*  how is this happening during war? [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=2539.2999999999997s)]
*  Where are the Israeli Apache fighters? [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=2542.22s)]
*  Where are the response? [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=2544.7s)]
*  Because you know, I understand how big is Israel. [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=2546.54s)]
*  Israel is like as small, actually as small as New Jersey. [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=2548.3s)]
*  And in that area of New Jersey, there is like, [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=2551.94s)]
*  there is, yeah, you see, it's almost there. [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=2554.7000000000003s)]

*  in every five seconds. [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=2569.94s)]
*  It's like Starbucks in New York. [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=2570.94s)]
*  The response should be less than five minutes. [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=2573.0600000000004s)]
*  It took them eight hours. [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=2575.3s)]

*  It is, yes. [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=2973.6200000000003s)]
*  You see, being pro-Israel is good policy, [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=2974.46s)]
*  and every single tweet is like that. [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=2975.82s)]
*  They are basically looking to you in the eyes [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=2979.5s)]
*  and say like we're buying your elections [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=2981.42s)]
*  and you can't do anything about it. [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=2983.38s)]
*  So I can accept that from NRA, [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=2984.82s)]
*  because the NRA is a domestic group, right? [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=2986.92s)]
*  At least it presents the interest of American home, [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=2989.3s)]
*  like gun owners. [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=2995.7400000000002s)]
*  Oh, this is a very, [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=2997.42s)]
*  Oh, I just saw this guy recently. [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3000.2200000000003s)]
*  Mr. Massey who said like each one in Capitol Hill [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3001.06s)]
*  has an AIPAC handler. [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3004.94s)]
*  It's like I need to talk to my guy. [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3007.14s)]
*  Everybody but me has an AIPAC person. [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3008.94s)]
*  What does that mean, an AIPAC person? [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3011.38s)]
*  It's like your babysitter, your AIPAC babysitter, [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3012.82s)]
*  who is always talking to you for AIPAC. [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3015.5s)]
*  It's just kind of like having an agent or whatever. [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3019.42s)]
*  Yeah, but like a handler, go ahead, go continue. [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3026.18s)]
*  And I don't understand why every American politician [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3030.34s)]
*  have to go there and bend the knees. [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3032.98s)]
*  You go have lunch with them and they've got your cell number [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3034.54s)]
*  and you have conversations with them. [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3038.18s)]
*  Well, I think part of this- [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3042.22s)]
*  I'll talk to my AIPAC person. [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3043.06s)]
*  And it's clearly what we call them, my AIPAC guy. [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3045.1s)]
*  I'll talk to my AIPAC guy and see if I can get him to, [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3048.9s)]
*  dial those ads back. [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3052.42s)]
*  Group of Americans who lobby on behalf of Israel. [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3055.18s)]
*  They're for anything- [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3058.82s)]
*  But I think also it's like, you have to look at it as like, [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3059.66s)]
*  we live in a country that is a capitalism, right? [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3064.14s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3067.54s)]
*  And they are, like Israel just does, [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3068.3799999999997s)]
*  they're the best business people. [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3070.58s)]
*  They're like, it's almost like Monopoly and they won. [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3072.7s)]
*  That's what I feel like sometimes. [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3076.98s)]
*  Yeah, they won and good for them. [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3079.5s)]
*  They're very good, but how does an American feel? [[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3081.58s)]
*  Remember, you can't hold it against them [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3084.62s)]
*  because they are good at this. [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3085.7799999999997s)]
*  You can't hold it against them because they won, right? [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3088.14s)]
*  So you cannot hold it against Israel, [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3090.62s)]
*  but you hold it against Russia if they try, [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3092.22s)]
*  or China if they try. [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3094.2599999999998s)]
*  So why do we accept it from Israel, [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3095.54s)]
*  but not from Russia? [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3097.38s)]
*  Except what? [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3098.22s)]
*  Except them controlling the elections, you understand? [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3099.2999999999997s)]
*  So you have an AIPAC, which is a lobby, [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3102.62s)]
*  basic lobbying for another country. [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3107.54s)]
*  This is in the news and you can look it up. [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3111.54s)]
*  They paid a hundred million dollars in order to buy seats [[00:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3113.46s)]
*  for Congress people and Senate. [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3116.94s)]
*  And because of the people they were able to put there, [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3120.54s)]
*  they were able to approve $26 billion to Israel. [[00:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3123.18s)]
*  So understand, as an American, [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3127.14s)]
*  your politicians are being bought for $100 million [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3130.06s)]
*  and because of that, your country will send $26 billion [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3133.14s)]
*  to a different country. [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3138.18s)]
*  $26 billion that could have been spent in my own country, [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3139.18s)]
*  in my own community. [[00:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3142.42s)]
*  This is the biggest, the best return of investment ever. [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3143.58s)]
*  You pay a hundred million [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3147.14s)]
*  and I take back $26 billion from you. [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3148.46s)]
*  That's crazy. [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3150.8999999999996s)]
*  And this is why when I talk about what's happening, [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3151.74s)]
*  is I'm not even, you see, like, oh yeah, you missed that. [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3154.14s)]
*  What you just had, AIPAC targets progressive [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3158.1s)]
*  with $100 million in its coffers. [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3160.22s)]
*  So basically anybody who talks against you in Congress, [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3162.4599999999996s)]
*  you pay, basically you pay them out [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3167.18s)]
*  and then you take more money. [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3169.9399999999996s)]
*  Don't we as Americans deserve the $26 billion [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3172.58s)]
*  to be put in our communities? [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3175.8599999999997s)]
*  Oh, I think it's like, this is, we give them money [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3177.9s)]
*  but they control us. [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3182.06s)]
*  This is like. [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3183.78s)]
*  Oh, it's fucking, they're good at their business, dude. [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3184.6600000000003s)]
*  This is like a sugar daddy who's being slapped around [[00:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3187.58s)]
*  like a bitch from his sugar baby. [[00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3191.06s)]
*  This is like, there's like basically picking up a whore [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3194.14s)]
*  in the strip mall, in the strip in Las Vegas [[00:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3197.42s)]
*  and then suddenly she's in charge of your life. [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3199.82s)]
*  This is like having a dominatrix and so like, [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3203.14s)]
*  it's like, I'm gonna kick your balls and you're gonna like it. [[00:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3205.1800000000003s)]
*  And you're gonna pay me $26 billion for it. [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3208.78s)]
*  It's like, that doesn't work [[00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3210.46s)]
*  because I come from the Middle East [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3212.38s)]
*  and I'm used to dictatorship. [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3214.3s)]
*  I am used for us having no voice. [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3215.98s)]
*  I'm used to a certain class of people [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3218.42s)]
*  controlling the country. [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3220.38s)]
*  But even then we knew that these people are not in control [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3222.1s)]
*  because they had to answer for China or Russia [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3225.94s)]
*  or America or France, right? [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3228.5s)]
*  Because we're a dictatorship. [[00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3230.6600000000003s)]
*  This is how dictatorship works. [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3231.58s)]
*  A democracy loving country like America or Britain [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3233.2200000000003s)]
*  go control a certain country [[00:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3237.02s)]
*  and it's easier for them to deal with a dictator. [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3238.5s)]
*  So we knew that they were not calling the shots. [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3240.34s)]
*  It was called from Washington. [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3242.46s)]
*  I'm fine with that because I'm a third world country. [[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3244.1s)]
*  We're from the Middle East. [[00:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3246.2599999999998s)]
*  We have to follow the masters of this planet. [[00:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3247.62s)]
*  Now I came to America and I became an American. [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3250.42s)]
*  I thought I was like joining, I'm joining the winning team. [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3252.98s)]
*  I will have a say in my country [[00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3257.1s)]
*  and then suddenly my country, [[00:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3259.3s)]
*  the most powerful country in the world, [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3260.5s)]
*  the superpower in the world has its policies [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3262.02s)]
*  being dictated from Tel Aviv. [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3264.38s)]
*  How does it work? [[00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3265.82s)]
*  And it's fine. [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3267.94s)]
*  And I ask Americans, guys, are you used to this? [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3269.34s)]
*  Is this kind of humiliation? [[00:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3271.54s)]
*  You're supposed to be from a country for the people, [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3272.98s)]
*  by the people, and then suddenly your elections [[00:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3276.1s)]
*  and being dictated by a different country, [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3278.06s)]
*  how does it work? [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3280.3s)]
*  But to me the thing is just like, [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3281.7s)]
*  making it, is it true or not? [[00:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3283.54s)]
*  It's like, just tell me what's happening. [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3286.7400000000002s)]
*  I just told you. [[00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3289.42s)]
*  Right. [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3290.26s)]
*  So whatever I just told you that like a foreign lobby [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3291.1s)]
*  from a foreign country is controlling your politics [[00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3294.02s)]
*  right in front of you and then you have, [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3296.22s)]
*  and by the way, I understand how lobby works [[00:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3298.5s)]
*  because, but remember when Democrats [[00:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3301.7799999999997s)]
*  was giving shit to Republicans, [[00:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3305.1s)]
*  where they were having so much money from NRA, right? [[00:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3306.5s)]
*  Oh, you're taking money from the gun lobby. [[00:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3309.5s)]
*  How dare you? [[00:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3311.7s)]
*  And then the Republicans were attacked. [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3312.54s)]
*  You're taking money from tech. [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3315.58s)]
*  Israel is the only country that gives both sides [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3317.1s)]
*  and nobody questions. [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3320.4599999999996s)]
*  So basically it's not, [[00:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3321.9399999999996s)]
*  caring about the education will not get you elected. [[00:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3324.26s)]

*  Because one of the reasons I'm sure America and Israel [[00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3376.8199999999997s)]
*  have like work together is because they need each other, [[00:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3379.62s)]
*  right? [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3383.8199999999997s)]

*  Yeah, Jordan is the other country's peace, UAE peace. [[00:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3402.9s)]
*  Do you have, really the big threat for Israel [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3408.86s)]
*  is the little militant group in the Gaza Strip, [[00:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3412.2200000000003s)]
*  which is Hamas and Hezbollah, which is south of Lebanon. [[00:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3414.58s)]
*  And if you have all of that military might. [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3417.42s)]
*  Hezbollah, is that? [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3419.6600000000003s)]
*  Yeah, it's up there. [[00:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3420.82s)]
*  Like you see the gray area, like in Lebanon. [[00:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3422.14s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3424.78s)]
*  Is that where you live? [[00:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3425.62s)]
*  So basically you have like two militant groups [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3426.46s)]
*  who doesn't like you, right? [[00:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3427.9s)]
*  Supported by Iran, which is far away from you. [[00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3429.62s)]
*  And you have all of these Arab countries around you, [[00:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3432.06s)]
*  basically friends with you. [[00:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3435.02s)]
*  So all of these, they wanna kill us all. [[00:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3436.14s)]
*  We're gonna perish, all of this. [[00:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3437.94s)]
*  You see Saudi Arabia, [[00:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3439.7799999999997s)]
*  they have like almost normalized relationship. [[00:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3440.8599999999997s)]
*  UAE, one of the countries. [[00:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3443.06s)]
*  So you don't believe that? [[00:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3444.9s)]
*  You believe that they have a pretty stable over there. [[00:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3445.74s)]
*  It is a way to push in war and make you, [[00:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3447.58s)]
*  because if you're not threatened, how can you sell the war? [[00:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3449.9s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3452.18s)]
*  And if you talk about October 7th, [[00:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3453.02s)]
*  see what they want to be, [[00:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3455.54s)]
*  you believe that before October 7th, there were peace. [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3457.42s)]
*  Actually before October 7th, two weeks before October 7th, [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3460.1s)]
*  Israel bombed Gaza three times. [[00:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3462.54s)]
*  Before October 7th, Israel already killed 75 children [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3464.86s)]
*  in the West Bank in the same year. [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3468.1400000000003s)]
*  All of these numbers were happening. [[00:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3471.1s)]
*  All of this ongoing, there was no peace before October 7th. [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3472.58s)]
*  And you go in and you go home with these lies [[00:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3476.1400000000003s)]
*  that has never been refuted by the American media, [[00:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3478.1400000000003s)]
*  although it was found to be lies and lies and lies. [[00:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3480.5s)]
*  And you do that because you wanna tell people [[00:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3484.1s)]
*  we're dealing with terrorists. [[00:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3486.1s)]
*  All of the Arab countries hate us and we have to kill us. [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3487.1400000000003s)]
*  And then they will bring in the Holocaust. [[00:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3489.98s)]
*  I'm very sorry for the Holocaust guys, [[00:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3491.6200000000003s)]
*  but we had nothing to do with your Holocaust. [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3493.5s)]
*  We were just like minding our fucking business. [[00:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3495.26s)]
*  I was dead or whatever, I wasn't dead, I wasn't alive. [[00:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3497.66s)]
*  We were in the Middle East, we were just there [[00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3500.42s)]
*  and the Holocaust happened to you in Europe. [[00:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3502.42s)]
*  It didn't happen to you because of us. [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3504.06s)]
*  And then you import people from a different continent [[00:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3506.14s)]
*  because you didn't want them, you didn't give them visa, [[00:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3508.82s)]
*  you didn't take them as refugees. [[00:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3510.86s)]
*  And then you- [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3512.42s)]
*  The whole American Britain you mean? [[00:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3513.26s)]
*  Yeah, and then you put them on our land [[00:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3514.1s)]
*  and then you take our land and then you tell everybody, [[00:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3516.3s)]
*  oh, there was no one there. [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3518.2200000000003s)]
*  So has America showed up, Britain showed up [[00:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3519.54s)]
*  and tried to help facilitate communications [[00:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3522.02s)]
*  to make things better there? [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3526.86s)]
*  There were many tries for peace treaties, [[00:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3528.26s)]
*  but Obama said it best. [[00:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3530.42s)]
*  In his book he said, the problem with Israel and Palestine [[00:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3532.22s)]
*  is that one of them is very strong [[00:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3534.7400000000002s)]
*  and one side is very weak. [[00:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3536.22s)]
*  And there's nothing that compels me to give you land. [[00:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3537.82s)]
*  So they will tell you, oh, we gave five chances [[00:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3540.62s)]
*  to the Palestinians and they said, no, that is not true. [[00:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3543.78s)]
*  When I have the whole land and suddenly [[00:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3547.62s)]
*  you're gonna give me 49%, that is not a deal. [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3550.42s)]
*  That's like, if you don't like it, [[00:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3553.2200000000003s)]
*  we're gonna take it from you. [[00:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3554.2200000000003s)]
*  If you give me like a shitty deal and I don't accept it [[00:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3555.46s)]
*  because that is my land, you just gonna say like, [[00:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3558.42s)]
*  oh, they didn't accept it. [[00:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3560.9s)]
*  Right, so, but have there been deals offered [[00:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3562.3s)]
*  but one way or the other like peace- [[00:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3564.34s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, like there's something called the Oslo Accords. [[00:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3565.6600000000003s)]
*  It happened in 1995. [[00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3567.86s)]
*  The Oslaw Accords? [[00:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3569.2200000000003s)]
*  The Oslaw Accords. [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3570.38s)]
*  And you have Netanyahu bragging on tape saying [[00:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3571.58s)]
*  that I have personally sabotaged the Oslaw Accords [[00:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3575.94s)]
*  so it means nothing. [[00:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3579.46s)]
*  Okay, the Oslaw Accords are a pair of interim agreements [[00:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3581.98s)]
*  between Israel and Palestine Liberation Organization, PLO, [[00:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3584.1s)]
*  signed in Washington, D.C. in 1993, signed in Egypt in 1995. [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3588.2200000000003s)]
*  They marked the start of the Oslaw process, [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3592.2200000000003s)]
*  a peace process aimed at achieving a peace treaty [[00:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3593.86s)]
*  based on resolutions of the United Nations Security Council. [[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3596.14s)]
*  Among the notable outcomes Oslaw was the creation [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3603.2200000000003s)]
*  of the Palestinian National Authority [[01:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3605.3s)]
*  which was tasked with the responsibility [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3607.3s)]
*  of conducting limited Palestinian governance [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3608.74s)]
*  over parts of the West Bank and Gaza Strip. [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3610.7s)]
*  So this was helping Palestine create a government? [[01:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3612.5s)]
*  Yes, but then it was all over the way it's now clean. [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3614.4199999999996s)]
*  The Oslaw Peace Accords were wrecked by Netanyahu [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3618.5s)]
*  and that was written by Avi Shleim [[01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3620.58s)]
*  who's an Israeli author. [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3622.3799999999997s)]
*  Right, because there's people in Israel [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3623.7799999999997s)]
*  that don't agree with Netanyahu, right? [[01:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3626.4199999999996s)]
*  Yes, I know, but honestly, I'm sick and tired of saying, [[01:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3628.2999999999997s)]
*  oh, Netanyahu is bad but the rest of Israel, no. [[01:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3630.9799999999996s)]

*  Only 2% says it's too much. [[01:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3637.7s)]
*  70% of Israelis said that we should not send humanitarian aid [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3639.8599999999997s)]

*  A lot of people, and I don't blame, I mean, I blame them, [[01:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3644.3799999999997s)]
*  but when you tell your people that those are evils [[01:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3647.2999999999997s)]
*  and they're like vampires and they're like killers, [[01:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3650.58s)]

*  But you cannot expect to treat people like animals [[01:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3655.66s)]
*  and when they behave like animals, retaliate like animals, [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3660.18s)]
*  you go on and complain. [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3662.8199999999997s)]

*  Yeah. [[01:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3673.8599999999997s)]
*  How do you find, how is there some sort of a solution? [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3674.7s)]
*  Like what direction do you see? [[01:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3677.3399999999997s)]
*  The solution is fixing the occupation. [[01:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3678.9799999999996s)]
*  There is an occupation, that is the thing. [[01:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3681.54s)]
*  And why doesn't America and Britain step in and say, [[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3682.7799999999997s)]
*  look, we helped create this in the beginning, [[01:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3685.14s)]

*  Elected officials. [[01:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3696.62s)]
*  These people are elected through what? [[01:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3697.8999999999996s)]
*  Through elections. [[01:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3699.62s)]
*  Who's controlling the elections [[01:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3700.46s)]
*  and paying for certain people to be there? [[01:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3701.66s)]
*  APAC. [[01:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3703.7s)]
*  But do we know, but don't, [[01:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3704.8599999999997s)]
*  doesn't every country have lobbyists [[01:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3706.02s)]
*  that try to like influence our elections? [[01:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3707.58s)]
*  Not a foreign lobby like this. [[01:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3709.7799999999997s)]
*  Yeah, there is lobbies everywhere, [[01:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3711.4199999999996s)]
*  but when you have a foreign lobby that works [[01:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3713.14s)]
*  for an external country, that is not normal to you. [[01:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3715.3399999999997s)]
*  But is that considered just like a, [[01:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3718.5s)]
*  you know how we have like little base [[01:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3720.66s)]
*  or a little, what are the places called [[01:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3724.26s)]
*  if you're in London, oh, the embassy. [[01:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3727.1800000000003s)]
*  Like we have embassies in different places. [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3728.7000000000003s)]
*  Yes. [[01:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3730.38s)]
*  Isn't that just like them having like a human embassy [[01:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3731.2200000000003s)]
*  or something like a. [[01:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3733.6200000000003s)]
*  No, no. [[01:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3734.5400000000004s)]
*  You know what I'm talking about kind of. [[01:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3735.38s)]
*  I understand, but like that doesn't work [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3736.2200000000003s)]
*  with lobbies with parliaments. [[01:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3738.6600000000003s)]
*  And like this is, again, this is like, [[01:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3740.5s)]
*  imagine a lobby that is openly funded by China [[01:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3743.5400000000004s)]
*  and that lobby going there and buying seats [[01:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3746.78s)]
*  for people who are pro-China. [[01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3749.0600000000004s)]
*  It seemed like unfair. [[01:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3751.6200000000003s)]
*  It's, it should not be accepted in a democratic country. [[01:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3752.78s)]
*  Why do we allow that to happen? [[01:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3757.6600000000003s)]
*  It would seem like, well, but then you know what? [[01:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3759.7000000000003s)]
*  That's where it comes down to capitalism [[01:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3762.1800000000003s)]
*  because it's the same shit that we allow where, [[01:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3764.0600000000004s)]
*  just like where that drug company came in [[01:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3767.7000000000003s)]
*  and hired former people from the FDA [[01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3770.82s)]
*  to come and work for their drug company. [[01:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3774.6200000000003s)]
*  No, that's wrong, that's illegal. [[01:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3776.1000000000004s)]
*  Right. [[01:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3777.1800000000003s)]
*  And also the government. [[01:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3778.02s)]
*  I mean, capitalism wants you to believe [[01:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3780.26s)]
*  there's nothing you can do, it's only the free market. [[01:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3782.1s)]
*  Even the free market has some sort [[01:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3783.62s)]
*  of a government control. [[01:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3785.06s)]
*  If a company goes out and become a monopoly, [[01:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3786.26s)]
*  you have antitrust laws [[01:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3788.5s)]
*  and that government can curb that company. [[01:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3789.94s)]
*  But the problem is the government that should curb [[01:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3793.62s)]
*  the influence of a foreign lobby [[01:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3795.86s)]
*  is being paid by the same foreign lobby. [[01:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3798.02s)]
*  So who would come up and put like a questioning [[01:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3800.66s)]
*  for Israel lobby, the people they just paid [[01:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3803.38s)]
*  get into Congress, I paid you. [[01:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3805.9s)]
*  I own your ass. [[01:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3808.14s)]
*  You are not gonna go into Congress [[01:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3809.5s)]
*  and then ask why are we followed. [[01:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3811.18s)]
*  Israel's a gangster. [[01:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3813.8199999999997s)]
*  Exactly, this is what really make me disenfranchised. [[01:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3815.62s)]
*  I became an American citizen in 2019 [[01:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3818.9s)]
*  and I was so, right in time for the 2020 elections. [[01:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3821.1s)]
*  I was so happy, I'm gonna be elected. [[01:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3823.9s)]
*  It took me now four years, [[01:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3825.7799999999997s)]
*  I'm not gonna vote in the coming elections. [[01:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3827.2999999999997s)]
*  I go, what's the point? [[01:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3828.8599999999997s)]
*  What about America, man? [[01:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3830.2999999999997s)]
*  What America? [[01:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3831.62s)]
*  It's like, so now I'm, why would I even care [[01:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3832.46s)]
*  to vote for anybody while both of them are competing [[01:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3834.98s)]
*  to be Israel's favorite bitch? [[01:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3837.7799999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3839.7s)]
*  It's basically like this, it's like, [[01:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3841.9s)]
*  oh, I'm the best one for Israel. [[01:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3842.74s)]
*  How about being the best one for America? [[01:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3844.34s)]
*  How about doing what's good for America? [[01:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3846.66s)]
*  Is it good for America to pay $26 billion? [[01:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3848.46s)]
*  If I'm seeing this, how do I feel as an American? [[01:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3850.94s)]
*  Well, I think it's, well, for one, [[01:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3855.3s)]
*  I think a lot of people don't know what to think. [[01:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3856.94s)]
*  A lot of people aren't super clear [[01:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3860.34s)]
*  on maybe what's going on, you know? [[01:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3861.58s)]
*  Because they're not allowed to, [[01:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3863.38s)]
*  because they are being, all they need to do [[01:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3864.22s)]
*  is like to see the headlines of the news [[01:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3866.7s)]
*  and the headlines of news is always something bad [[01:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3868.42s)]
*  about Palestinians or something bad. [[01:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3870.22s)]
*  Nothing is bad. [[01:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3872.4199999999996s)]
*  They don't spend enough time because they want their ESPNs [[01:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3873.4599999999996s)]
*  and they need to do Netflix. [[01:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3877.5s)]
*  They don't want to involve in things. [[01:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3879.02s)]
*  That's why a lot of Americans are still believing [[01:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3880.5s)]
*  in the raping and the decapitated babies [[01:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3883.02s)]
*  because you can't stay tuned into the news for long. [[01:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3884.9399999999996s)]
*  So for them, they do the shock, the lies, [[01:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3889.1s)]
*  and then when people say, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, [[01:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3892.06s)]
*  that didn't happen. [[01:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3894.3799999999997s)]
*  It's like, ah, it's too late now [[01:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3895.22s)]
*  because people are kind of, they're tuned out. [[01:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3896.2999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, I think a lot of people do not even believe [[01:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3898.5s)]
*  the news at all anymore though. [[01:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3900.3s)]
*  I think the news has super lost [[01:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3901.46s)]
*  a ton of credibility over the years. [[01:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3903.7s)]
*  So what happens? [[01:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3905.06s)]
*  You create a kind of apathy. [[01:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3906.14s)]
*  So people don't care and business go as usual. [[01:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3908.18s)]
*  The Congress getting bought, people getting bribed, [[01:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3911.5s)]
*  $26 billion getting sent to Israel, [[01:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3915.3s)]
*  people continue having bombing, [[01:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3917.98s)]
*  and then every now and then, why is this happening? [[01:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3919.34s)]
*  Because you checked out a long time ago. [[01:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3921.58s)]
*  And then you ask, what can we do? [[01:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3924.14s)]
*  Nothing, because they made you check out a long time ago. [[01:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3925.7s)]
*  So we have all of these people [[01:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3929.26s)]
*  looking at what the government's doing, [[01:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3930.58s)]
*  looking at what the world is doing. [[01:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3932.02s)]
*  It's like, that ain't right, [[01:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3933.42s)]
*  but there's nothing I can do about it. [[01:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3934.82s)]
*  And this is exactly how you run the world. [[01:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3936.34s)]
*  In my country, in the Middle East, [[01:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3939.82s)]
*  I do that because you cannot speak up [[01:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3942.2200000000003s)]
*  because you're gonna be put in jail. [[01:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3944.62s)]
*  But here, you can speak up, but nothing will happen. [[01:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3946.7000000000003s)]
*  Nothing will change. [[01:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3949.98s)]
*  Here, I think sometimes you get afraid [[01:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3950.82s)]
*  to even ask questions about stuff, [[01:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3952.1400000000003s)]
*  and it's like, well, this doesn't even make any sense. [[01:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3953.9s)]
*  Just at least let things make sense to me. [[01:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3956.6600000000003s)]
*  For me, not being able to ask questions and shit [[01:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3958.42s)]
*  is just fucking, that's the thing that's really, really weird. [[01:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3960.2200000000003s)]
*  Yeah, because it's all about the attacking. [[01:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3963.5s)]
*  So if you go and you repeat what I just told you, [[01:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3965.54s)]
*  it's like, oh, I see you, he's a liar. [[01:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3968.34s)]
*  He's an anti-Semite, he hates Jews. [[01:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3969.54s)]
*  Okay, what did he lie about? [[01:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3971.26s)]
*  They will never give you a details. [[01:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3972.6600000000003s)]
*  What did he lie about? [[01:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3974.26s)]
*  I'll give you an example. [[01:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3975.6200000000003s)]
*  On the second Piers Morgan interview, [[01:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3976.86s)]
*  I went up to him and I gave him a story. [[01:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3978.3s)]
*  I told him that Israel used to give contraceptive pills [[01:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3979.6200000000003s)]
*  to the Ethiopian Jews, Ethiopian Jewish women [[01:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3985.02s)]
*  who were immigrated from Ethiopia. [[01:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3987.94s)]
*  From Ethiopia, and for more than 15 years, [[01:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3989.8199999999997s)]
*  Israel would give them contraceptive shots [[01:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3994.62s)]
*  without them knowing, so they would sterilize them. [[01:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3997.06s)]
*  They would not allow them to breathe [[01:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=3999.7799999999997s)]
*  because they are black. [[01:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4000.7799999999997s)]
*  Is that true? [[01:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4002.2599999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4003.1s)]
*  Dude, you know what I noticed, dude? [[01:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4007.02s)]
*  I was in Atlanta at the Coca-Cola factory or whatever, [[01:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4008.62s)]
*  and you can taste all the sodas from around the world? [[01:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4012.14s)]
*  Look. [[01:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4015.66s)]
*  Ethiopian women in Israel [[01:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4017.66s)]
*  give me contraceptive without consent, huh? [[01:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4018.7s)]
*  Yeah, so- [[01:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4021.46s)]
*  Israel's Lee- [[01:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4022.58s)]
*  So when Benjamin Netanyahu was in the government [[01:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4023.7799999999997s)]
*  and he came out and he personally apologized, right? [[01:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4029.1s)]
*  So this is cut and dry. [[01:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4031.8199999999997s)]
*  You cannot, and you know what happened [[01:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4033.7s)]
*  that the Israelis on the X, oh, he's a liar. [[01:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4035.3399999999997s)]
*  That never happens, it's here. [[01:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4038.02s)]
*  So I'm just preparing you [[01:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4040.42s)]
*  that every time you're gonna tell them something, [[01:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4042.7000000000003s)]
*  they will tell you, oh, it's a lie, it's a lie. [[01:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4044.7000000000003s)]
*  Nobody said that, nobody said that. [[01:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4046.1s)]
*  Well, a lot of that's just, I mean, yeah. [[01:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4047.7400000000002s)]
*  People will position themselves constantly. [[01:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4049.58s)]
*  It's like people are, especially if people are up to no good, [[01:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4054.7400000000002s)]
*  nobody wants to get caught a lot of times. [[01:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4058.5s)]
*  Yeah, it's like you saying something and somebody, [[01:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4061.9s)]
*  you're a racist. [[01:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4063.58s)]
*  It's like, wait, what did I just say that was racist? [[01:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4064.42s)]
*  Oh no, no, you're a racist. [[01:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4066.26s)]
*  You're making me uncomfortable. [[01:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4067.26s)]
*  You see the way that they attack you. [[01:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4068.62s)]
*  Okay, attack what I said. [[01:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4071.42s)]
*  Yeah, if I'm racist, dude, I do it at home, [[01:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4074.58s)]
*  behind closed doors. [[01:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4077.5s)]
*  But you're anti-Semitic, you're racist, you're a homophobe. [[01:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4079.86s)]
*  The way that they use, like the same way, [[01:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4082.66s)]
*  oh, you're Islamophobe. [[01:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4085.34s)]
*  I don't like this word, Islamophobe. [[01:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4086.2599999999998s)]
*  I don't know if anybody cares about that shit anymore. [[01:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4087.46s)]
*  Nobody cares. [[01:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4089.22s)]
*  Well, people have thrown around some of those terms [[01:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4090.54s)]
*  so many times, it's like the boy that cried wolf [[01:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4092.42s)]
*  kind of in a way. Exactly. [[01:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4094.58s)]
*  You can't make it feel like I can't ask something [[01:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4095.66s)]
*  or talk about something. [[01:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4100.66s)]
*  Yeah, sometimes that just, [[01:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4102.06s)]
*  sometimes some of that stuff is strange. [[01:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4103.5s)]
*  And it's hard. [[01:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4107.66s)]
*  I mean, some of this stuff is even hard to talk about [[01:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4108.5s)]
*  because it's like, I worry that even just by having [[01:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4110.3s)]
*  some of this conversation, it's like, [[01:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4113.1s)]
*  you just, it's kind of scary [[01:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4115.3s)]
*  because I don't know what I could get in trouble for. [[01:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4117.58s)]
*  But this is scary, man, because I'm new to this country. [[01:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4119.5s)]
*  So I'm kind of following your lead, guys. [[01:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4122.46s)]
*  And I'm saying like, wait, isn't this country made, [[01:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4124.66s)]
*  created on the cornerstone of freedom of expression? [[01:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4127.62s)]
*  Why is there some things that we are not allowed [[01:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4130.78s)]
*  to speak about or afraid? [[01:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4134.139999999999s)]
*  This is the promise of the West. [[01:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4135.46s)]
*  Come here and speak and say whatever you want, [[01:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4137.82s)]
*  no matter how offensive it is, it doesn't matter [[01:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4140.38s)]
*  because it is words. [[01:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4142.58s)]
*  But then suddenly you come here [[01:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4143.7s)]
*  and you find all of these red lines. [[01:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4144.94s)]
*  And I was made fun of like when I came, [[01:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4146.38s)]
*  oh, you came from the Middle East, [[01:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4148.34s)]
*  you have all of these red lines. [[01:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4149.5s)]
*  You cannot speak about that. [[01:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4150.98s)]
*  We can't speak about Jesus. [[01:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4152.3s)]
*  We can't speak about the American president. [[01:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4153.42s)]
*  You can't speak. [[01:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4154.74s)]
*  And now I come here and I see the red line. [[01:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4155.58s)]
*  You have one red line. [[01:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4157.18s)]
*  Really? [[01:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4158.14s)]
*  And you have one red line, everybody here, not you. [[01:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4158.9800000000005s)]
*  Then that red line, everybody can see you guys [[01:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4161.5s)]
*  cannot be able to talk about, which is Israel. [[01:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4164.9400000000005s)]
*  This is your red line. [[01:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4168.26s)]
*  Your red line is not even in your country. [[01:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4169.1s)]
*  Yeah, that's crazy. [[01:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4171.22s)]
*  Which is crazy. [[01:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4172.06s)]
*  That's a crazy statement. [[01:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4173.18s)]
*  It's that crazy. [[01:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4174.02s)]
*  Dude, I'll tell you what I heard, dude. [[01:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4174.86s)]
*  I heard that Jesus did like a lot of impersonations. [[01:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4176.14s)]
*  What did he impersonate his dad? [[01:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4179.58s)]
*  Just his friends and stuff. [[01:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4184.06s)]
*  But I heard that somewhere. [[01:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4185.18s)]
*  I don't know where I read that, [[01:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4186.54s)]
*  but he would do like impersonations, I guess, or whatever. [[01:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4187.5s)]
*  But he would be like the archangel Michael. [[01:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4190.5s)]
*  It's like, hey, so archangel Michael's like, hey, Jesus. [[01:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4193.9800000000005s)]
*  Hey, Jesus. [[01:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4196.5s)]
*  But he's like. [[01:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4197.58s)]
*  So an archangel walks into a cloud. [[01:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4198.42s)]
*  But I think, and okay, I'll tell you something [[01:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4200.62s)]
*  about like things that people find offensive, for example. [[01:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4203.38s)]
*  We were basically profiled as Muslims that we hate. [[01:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4208.3s)]
*  Slims, we call them. [[01:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4213.0599999999995s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, slims. [[01:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4213.98s)]
*  Yeah, I made that up a couple years ago. [[01:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4215.62s)]
*  It's like, I don't wanna say it's a racial slur, [[01:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4217.42s)]
*  but if it is, you're welcome. [[01:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4219.86s)]
*  Slims, it's like the slims of cigarettes. [[01:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4221.98s)]
*  It's like, whenever we say Muslims. [[01:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4224.38s)]
*  Isn't it people who like we smoke hookahs? [[01:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4226.62s)]
*  We say slims, yeah. [[01:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4227.98s)]
*  I think it's, I really like it. [[01:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4231.3s)]
*  Some people might not like it, and that's okay. [[01:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4233.099999999999s)]
*  One thing that kind of like drives me clear sometimes, [[01:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4236.94s)]

*  Judeo-Christian values. [[01:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4245.42s)]
*  Guys, what do you talk about Judeo-Christian values? [[01:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4246.82s)]
*  You understand that people in Israel hate Christians? [[01:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4249.3s)]
*  You understand that? [[01:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4252.94s)]
*  You go right now. [[01:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4253.78s)]
*  That's not true, you think? [[01:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4254.62s)]
*  You go right now in the video and you write [[01:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4255.7s)]
*  Israelis spitting on Christians in Bethlehem, [[01:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4258.66s)]
*  or spitting on Christians in Israel, you see? [[01:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4262.139999999999s)]
*  Spitting, hitting, attacks on Israel, [[01:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4268.46s)]
*  mass surging in Israel, occupied Israel, [[01:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4270.0199999999995s)]
*  ultra-Jewish, spitting on Christians. [[01:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4272.86s)]
*  But this could be specific stuff. [[01:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4274.86s)]
*  No, no, this is part, okay, so. [[01:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4276.54s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[01:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4278.74s)]
*  This might not be an everyday thing, [[01:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4279.58s)]
*  because I have a lot of friends that are Jewish [[01:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4280.54s)]
*  and they'll treat you bad. [[01:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4281.98s)]
*  There's like so many videos. [[01:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4282.82s)]
*  It's just like the videos keep scrolling as we say, [[01:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4284.74s)]
*  that's not that very, you see how many videos [[01:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4286.7s)]
*  right now we're talking? [[01:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4288.7s)]
*  The videos keep scrolling, that's not that everything, [[01:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4291.259999999999s)]
*  but we happen to have 100 videos to say that that's true. [[01:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4293.379999999999s)]
*  Oh, it says there's only 2,000 videos. [[01:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4297.46s)]
*  Oh, okay, okay, and you have actually one of their ministers, [[01:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4299.66s)]
*  Ben Gavir, who is the basic national security, [[01:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4305.86s)]
*  as we said, it is actually part of our religion. [[01:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4308.74s)]
*  There's no hate about that. [[01:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4311.42s)]
*  And many of their rabbis will say that Jesus right now, [[01:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4313.38s)]
*  Jesus is the son of a whore, the Virgin Mary is a whore, [[01:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4317.42s)]
*  she made up the whole thing about the son of God [[01:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4321.0199999999995s)]
*  in order to cover for her adultery. [[01:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4323.46s)]
*  And Jesus right now is being burned with feces [[01:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4326.3s)]
*  and semen for eternity. [[01:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4329.82s)]
*  This is what they say. [[01:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4331.7s)]
*  So basically, I don't know if you follow this trend. [[01:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4333.0199999999995s)]
*  Yeah, you can find it out. [[01:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4335.38s)]
*  And this is a trend on TikTok? [[01:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4336.22s)]
*  No, not a trend, these videos are already there. [[01:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4337.86s)]
*  So basically when Christians go there, [[01:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4340.34s)]
*  the Orthodox Jews will go, haktuah. [[01:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4342.7s)]
*  They go, haktuah, they spit on that thing. [[01:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4347.7s)]
*  That thing. [[01:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4352.78s)]
*  So, and again, and I'm not saying [[01:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4355.62s)]
*  that this represents all Jews, [[01:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4357.62s)]
*  but what I'm saying is if you want net pick about this, [[01:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4359.34s)]
*  because I grew up as a Muslim, [[01:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4361.9s)]
*  and all of those videos net picking of like, [[01:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4364.42s)]
*  oh, look at this extreme Muslim who said that, [[01:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4366.9s)]
*  oh, this must be all Muslim, all Muslim terrorists. [[01:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4369.48s)]
*  And you have a lot of those videos [[01:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4372.26s)]
*  and nobody's talking about it. [[01:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4373.94s)]
*  So you understand like how this is personal for me? [[01:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4375.38s)]
*  And I'm fine talking about those horrible people [[01:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4378.179999999999s)]
*  in the Muslim community, but talk about everybody. [[01:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4380.18s)]
*  Don't limit our speech. [[01:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4383.38s)]
*  By the way, and I hate the word Islamophobe. [[01:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4386.46s)]
*  Anybody is allowed to talk about Islam or the Quran, [[01:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4388.18s)]
*  whatever, I will never call you an Islamophobe. [[01:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4391.34s)]
*  But I'm an equal opportunity offender. [[01:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4393.42s)]
*  If you talk about my religion, [[01:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4395.22s)]
*  let's talk about everybody's religion. [[01:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4396.34s)]
*  If you're gonna talk about my politics, [[01:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4398.14s)]
*  let's talk about everybody's politics. [[01:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4399.780000000001s)]
*  I'm not here to attack Jewish people, [[01:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4401.58s)]
*  I'm not here to attack Israel. [[01:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4403.66s)]
*  I am just asking for my right as an American [[01:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4405.1s)]
*  to be able to speak about everything [[01:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4408.94s)]
*  without having fear of being canceled [[01:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4410.82s)]
*  or having my career canceled. [[01:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4413.62s)]
*  I had opportunities, my opportunities in Hollywood [[01:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4416.219999999999s)]
*  dried up completely after I took that. [[01:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4420.46s)]
*  Is that true? [[01:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4422.259999999999s)]
*  Yes. [[01:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4423.099999999999s)]
*  Do you think it's tougher for Arabic [[01:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4423.94s)]
*  and Islamic entertainers in Hollywood? [[01:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4426.0199999999995s)]
*  It is tougher, but there's also people who are not Muslims, [[01:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4429.82s)]
*  who are not Arabs, who had canceled [[01:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4432.46s)]
*  because of their opinions. [[01:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4435.5s)]
*  There have been blacklists of people in tech companies [[01:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4436.94s)]
*  that have been removed from their companies [[01:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4440.339999999999s)]
*  because of a post on Facebook, [[01:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4442.299999999999s)]
*  and this is happening in America. [[01:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4443.98s)]
*  And of course, you remember what happened in these colleges [[01:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4445.74s)]
*  where American students were being beaten by American police [[01:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4447.9s)]
*  for the sake of a foreign country. [[01:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4451.74s)]
*  You understand the American university movement, [[01:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4454.259999999999s)]
*  which one of the most amazing movements, [[01:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4458.299999999999s)]
*  that they went out against Vietnam, [[01:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4460.099999999999s)]
*  they went out against South Africa, [[01:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4461.66s)]

*  and they're being hit and penalized in their own campuses [[01:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4464.86s)]
*  for just speaking up. [[01:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4470.46s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4471.94s)]
*  Yeah, I feel like they should be able to do that at campuses, [[01:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4473.0199999999995s)]
*  but then what happens is investors or donators [[01:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4474.94s)]
*  to the campuses who believe what they believe, [[01:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4478.66s)]
*  they choose to take their money away. [[01:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4483.82s)]
*  And those donors are pro what? [[01:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4486.94s)]
*  They're pro money. [[01:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4489.82s)]
*  So if you write, please, [[01:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4491.62s)]
*  Jewish billionaires threaten Columbia universities [[01:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4494.78s)]

*  I know, but I'm gonna get in trouble, dude. [[01:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4505.9s)]
*  Pro Israel Jewish billionaires, [[01:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4507.22s)]
*  look, there it is. [[01:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4509.26s)]
*  Billionaires stop Columbia cash over anti-Israel protests. [[01:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4510.62s)]
*  Columbia billionaires doors are giving, I mean, [[01:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4512.98s)]
*  so you see, what does it, [[01:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4515.34s)]
*  so your donors, the donors have more loyalty [[01:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4517.94s)]
*  to a foreign country and telling you, [[01:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4522.34s)]

*  I'm not gonna even give you my money. [[01:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4524.62s)]
*  But it makes sense though, that makes sense. [[01:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4526.06s)]
*  If you think that, say you're a, [[01:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4528.74s)]
*  like I'm a New Orleans Saints fan. [[01:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4532.02s)]

*  and it's my bar or something, [[01:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4539.46s)]

*  I'm gonna say, well, I'm not gonna help take care [[01:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4545.34s)]
*  of this place anymore if you support this. [[01:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4546.82s)]

*  in the league, in an American league. [[01:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4551.22s)]

*  That's fair. [[01:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4588.46s)]
*  And then you have, no, we need to be involved [[01:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4589.900000000001s)]
*  in other people's shit. [[01:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4593.18s)]
*  And you need not to speak about that. [[01:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4594.700000000001s)]
*  That doesn't make any sense. [[01:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4597.18s)]
*  That doesn't make any sense to me, man. [[01:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4598.1s)]
*  Well, why don't like, Arab, like why don't different groups [[01:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4599.5s)]
*  start to build their own strongholds of like university [[01:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4603.5s)]
*  and like media so that everybody can have their own channels? [[01:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4608.78s)]
*  Most Arabs work in vaping. [[01:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4613.34s)]
*  I don't know that there's money in the Arab community. [[01:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4615.219999999999s)]
*  Sure. [[01:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4618.0599999999995s)]
*  Hey, smoke signals. [[01:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4618.9s)]
*  We just said that like Jewish people are very good [[01:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4620.34s)]
*  in business. [[01:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4622.42s)]
*  We can't compete with that. [[01:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4623.259999999999s)]
*  We just have hookahs and vapes. [[01:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4624.38s)]
*  We can't compete with them. [[01:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4626.78s)]
*  So, but like, you see, if that is the case, [[01:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4628.0599999999995s)]
*  don't call it a democracy anymore. [[01:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4631.0599999999995s)]
*  If the whole idea about like who pays them more money, [[01:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4632.9s)]
*  it's an oligarchy. [[01:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4636.38s)]
*  Don't call yourself democratic. [[01:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4638.66s)]
*  Just say, hey, it's a capitalist country. [[01:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4639.5s)]
*  Whoever has more money, but that's dangerous [[01:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4640.86s)]
*  because tomorrow China might have more money here [[01:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4643.0199999999995s)]
*  and control it. [[01:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4646.0599999999995s)]
*  So it has to be a fair game for everybody, [[01:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4646.9s)]
*  but it's not fair because now they say TikTok. [[01:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4648.9s)]
*  We need to ban TikTok because it's against Israel [[01:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4652.54s)]
*  because it's pro China. [[01:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4655.86s)]
*  So you're not even making the game fair. [[01:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4657.0599999999995s)]
*  If Israel can buy its way through it, [[01:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4661.5s)]
*  anybody should buy their way through it. [[01:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4663.82s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4665.5s)]
*  Oh, I see what you're saying. [[01:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4666.7s)]
*  Well, then if that's the case, [[01:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4668.34s)]
*  then China should be able to do it too. [[01:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4669.18s)]
*  And Saudi Arabia is able to do it [[01:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4670.94s)]
*  and Iran is able to do it. [[01:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4672.42s)]
*  But I think Israel's an ally. [[01:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4673.26s)]
*  I guess, why, I guess like. [[01:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4674.22s)]
*  Why is Israel an ally? [[01:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4675.62s)]
*  I don't know why. [[01:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4678.34s)]
*  And which ally have you given $26 billion? [[01:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4679.18s)]
*  I don't know, dude. [[01:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4682.82s)]
*  You see, but these things, we're repeating that, [[01:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4683.9s)]
*  oh, Israel is our greatest ally. [[01:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4686.5s)]
*  Why? [[01:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4688.0199999999995s)]
*  I don't know, but you have to have, [[01:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4689.1s)]
*  well, here's why I believe, [[01:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4690.42s)]
*  this is what I've always been kind of like, I guess, heard [[01:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4691.74s)]
*  is that you have to have an ally in the Middle East [[01:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4695.38s)]
*  because there's so much oil and power and money over there. [[01:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4698.02s)]
*  America doesn't have allies in the middle. [[01:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4702.46s)]
*  What about Saudi Arabia? [[01:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4703.78s)]
*  The biggest oil producing company in the world, [[01:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4704.62s)]
*  Iraq, Egypt, these are, all of Kuwait, [[01:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4706.74s)]
*  all of these are allies for the United States. [[01:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4710.42s)]
*  I don't know if Saudi Arabia is an ally. [[01:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4712.38s)]
*  I don't know about that. Really? [[01:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4714.06s)]
*  Saudi Arabia is the most beneficial for your economy. [[01:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4715.66s)]
*  Really? [[01:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4718.3s)]
*  But they are the biggest buyer of your weapons. [[01:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4719.14s)]
*  Except for the two buildings in New York City, dude, [[01:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4721.26s)]
*  outside of, you know what I'm saying? [[01:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4722.78s)]
*  Well, in so why didn't you go after them? [[01:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4724.5s)]
*  Because I guess somebody owed somebody some money [[01:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4726.38s)]
*  or something. [[01:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4728.38s)]
*  No, that's not about 9-11 now because it's a bigger issue. [[01:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4729.22s)]
*  We're gonna go really down the rabbit hole. [[01:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4731.98s)]
*  But here's the thing, you have all of those people, [[01:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4734.66s)]
*  they're allies. [[01:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4737.06s)]
*  What has Israel done to you being an ally? [[01:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4737.9s)]
*  It has ruined your reputation in front of everybody. [[01:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4739.9s)]
*  Hates America because of Israel. [[01:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4743.26s)]
*  I don't know if that's true. You think so? [[01:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4744.58s)]
*  Yeah, everybody hates America because of Israel. [[01:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4745.86s)]
*  I'm telling you. [[01:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4747.38s)]
*  And that's why they hate America [[01:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4748.54s)]
*  because what Israel is doing to Palestine. [[01:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4751.78s)]
*  How America is supporting Israel forever. [[01:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4754.38s)]
*  And if you find America supporting the killing [[01:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4758.34s)]
*  of my people, you can't help but people hate you, right? [[01:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4760.78s)]
*  At a certain point, I don't think that Israel [[01:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4763.66s)]
*  is a good ally for us. [[01:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4766.62s)]
*  They are costing us a lot of money. [[01:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4767.58s)]
*  They are harboring a lot of terrorists. [[01:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4769.7s)]
*  They are Jewish Defense League. [[01:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4771.66s)]
*  There are three people from Jewish Defense League in 1994 [[01:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4773.3s)]
*  who killed an American citizen and they escaped to Israel [[01:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4775.7s)]
*  and Israel is not delivering you. [[01:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4779.14s)]
*  Is that a work of an ally? [[01:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4780.58s)]
*  Israel hit the USS Liberty in 1967. [[01:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4781.98s)]
*  It's an American vessel. [[01:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4786.099999999999s)]
*  Does that an American? [[01:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4787.259999999999s)]
*  No. [[01:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4788.219999999999s)]
*  As there's a book called By Way of Deception [[01:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4789.0599999999995s)]
*  by Victor Ostrovsky who is an ex-Mosad officer [[01:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4791.82s)]
*  who said that Israel knew about the 1982 Lebanon bombing [[01:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4796.82s)]
*  where 52 Americans were killed [[01:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4801.46s)]
*  and Mosad held the information [[01:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4803.54s)]
*  so because they want to do it in spite. [[01:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4806.82s)]
*  Is that the work of an ally? [[01:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4809.219999999999s)]
*  Israel harbors the biggest number of pedophiles in Israel. [[01:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4812.9s)]
*  More than 50 people at least from 2014 [[01:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4818.86s)]
*  by the Jewish watch community. [[01:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4821.86s)]
*  There's actually a Jewish group who have actually said that. [[01:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4823.58s)]
*  So you have people who are molesting American children [[01:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4827.339999999999s)]
*  in America and they're escaping to Israel [[01:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4830.98s)]
*  using the dual nationality thing [[01:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4833.219999999999s)]
*  and Israel is not giving you back. [[01:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4834.62s)]
*  Is that the work of an ally? [[01:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4835.98s)]
*  If somebody's a molester, you gotta send them back. [[01:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4837.82s)]
*  It's on CBS News if you want to look it. [[01:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4839.54s)]
*  Like CBS News, you can talk about it. [[01:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4842.26s)]
*  You don't like Israel I think. [[01:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4845.1s)]
*  I don't like Israel, no. [[01:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4846.98s)]
*  I do not like it. [[01:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4848.06s)]
*  I think their ways are evil [[01:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4848.9s)]
*  and you see how Jewish American pedophiles [[01:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4851.0199999999995s)]
*  hide from justice in Israel. [[01:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4853.26s)]
*  That's CBS, I'm not making this up. [[01:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4854.34s)]
*  A lot of them too would hide by the, [[01:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4858.14s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4860.5s)]
*  Would hide by the Winn-Dixie in our area. [[01:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4861.34s)]
*  So is this a work of an ally? [[01:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4863.94s)]
*  Is an ally giving you $100 million [[01:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4866.5s)]
*  to bribe your politicians, buy your elections [[01:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4868.38s)]
*  and then make you pay $26 billion? [[01:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4871.02s)]
*  That's not a work of an ally. [[01:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4873.900000000001s)]
*  If someone takes $70 million of tax exempt money [[01:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4875.26s)]
*  for their veterans, that's not a work of an ally. [[01:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4878.62s)]
*  But how much, how many issues did America create [[01:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4880.66s)]
*  for itself just with its own practices of like doing this, [[01:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4884.22s)]
*  like these, doing those sorts of things [[01:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4889.54s)]
*  to other countries and stuff, I wonder. [[01:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4892.66s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[01:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4894.22s)]
*  Like I wonder if there's a part of, if that's true. [[01:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4895.06s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4899.14s)]
*  I mean America has known to finance and carry out coups [[01:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4899.9800000000005s)]
*  in all kinds of different countries. [[01:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4903.46s)]
*  In Latin America, they're known to like, [[01:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4905.62s)]
*  overthrowing a government if they don't like. [[01:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4907.42s)]
*  For example, it happened in Chile, it happened in Argentina, [[01:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4909.22s)]
*  it happened in so many places. [[01:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4912.02s)]
*  It happened in Iraq, Iraq in 1954, [[01:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4913.66s)]
*  there was like an elected official that they thrown out [[01:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4915.9400000000005s)]
*  because of oil agreements. [[01:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4919.74s)]
*  America is known to manipulate the whole world. [[01:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4921.780000000001s)]
*  It is, that's what superpowers do. [[01:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4925.22s)]
*  Like the Romans did it, the Greeks did it, I accept that. [[01:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4929.1s)]
*  I accept that because you're the police of the planet. [[01:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4931.700000000001s)]
*  Yes, it happened, it comes with a cost. [[01:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4934.34s)]
*  But couldn't that evolve [[01:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4936.34s)]
*  and then Israel could just become that? [[01:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4937.22s)]
*  What do you mean? [[01:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4939.34s)]
*  Like if we were the leader at one time, [[01:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4940.18s)]
*  couldn't Israel be the leader at one time? [[01:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4943.02s)]
*  Why? [[01:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4944.9400000000005s)]
*  Couldn't China be the leader at one time? [[01:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4945.780000000001s)]
*  Well, China I can accept because it's a superpower. [[01:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4947.22s)]
*  But Israel is a client state, it's a small state. [[01:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4950.780000000001s)]
*  This is like basically you living, [[01:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4953.14s)]
*  you're working in a corporate [[01:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4956.18s)]
*  and the CEO coming every day and shitting on your office. [[01:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4958.46s)]
*  Shitting on your office, it's like what? [[01:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4961.26s)]
*  He's the CEO, he's the owner. [[01:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4962.34s)]
*  But then he brings his little poodle [[01:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4963.700000000001s)]
*  and then he shits on your desk. [[01:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4965.58s)]
*  That's too much, that's Israel, right? [[01:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4967.26s)]
*  I can accept it because you are the superpower of the world, [[01:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4970.06s)]
*  but don't bring your brat dog to do it on my desk. [[01:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4973.14s)]
*  That's too much. [[01:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4976.700000000001s)]
*  Because the only way that I can do anything for that dog [[01:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4978.1s)]
*  is that the owner is the CEO and I don't wanna be fired. [[01:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4980.3s)]
*  So that's basically, Israel is the bulldog [[01:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4983.46s)]
*  that's harassing everybody around it in the region. [[01:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4986.1s)]
*  And they all hate us, where are we gonna perish? [[01:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4989.82s)]
*  Fuck it, you're not gonna perish. [[01:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4994.18s)]
*  You have nuclear weapons. [[01:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4995.42s)]
*  Yeah, they're fine. [[01:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4996.82s)]
*  They're fine, yeah. [[01:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4997.86s)]
*  It's definitely gets kind of warm. [[01:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4998.7s)]
*  They're fine. [[01:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=4999.52s)]
*  And then how is it a sense of self-defense? [[01:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=5000.36s)]
*  Because I'm sure that you've seen these videos, [[01:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=5002.9800000000005s)]
*  all of these IDF soldiers wearing women's laundry, [[01:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=5004.38s)]
*  taking the kids' toys, destroying empty hospitals, [[01:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=5006.54s)]
*  destroying empty schools just for the fun of it. [[01:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=5012.06s)]
*  That doesn't look like an army that is defending itself. [[01:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=5015.18s)]
*  Yeah, well to me it's felt like, [[01:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=5017.86s)]
*  the feeling of it is that, [[01:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=5020.58s)]
*  like usually when you hear, I mean I've said this before, [[01:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=5025.22s)]
*  usually when you hear like, free a place, [[01:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=5027.66s)]
*  that's the place that needs help. [[01:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=5029.88s)]
*  It's like you don't hear like, free Michigan [[01:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=5031.42s)]
*  or free America or free China, [[01:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=5034.0199999999995s)]
*  or sometimes you hear free China. [[01:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=5037.1s)]
*  But yeah, if you hear free Palestine, [[01:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=5038.58s)]
*  if you hear that, then that's usually, [[01:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=5042.26s)]
*  if something becomes that big of a fervor [[01:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=5044.74s)]
*  that that's the campaign slogan, [[01:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=5046.7s)]
*  that place usually needs some sort of help. [[01:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=5049.14s)]
*  How does some place that's stronger, [[01:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=5051.54s)]
*  like Israel that has so much, how do they help? [[01:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=5053.22s)]
*  How do we get to it? [[01:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=5057.38s)]
*  Why would they help? [[01:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=5058.22s)]
*  They just want the land. [[01:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=5059.18s)]
*  But they're the, but they- [[01:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=5060.42s)]
*  Remember the map that we saw how they disintegrate? [[01:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=5061.82s)]
*  This has been ongoing from 1940s. [[01:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=5063.78s)]
*  But they obviously have enough of the land. [[01:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=5066.18s)]
*  No, they want the whole land. [[01:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=5067.62s)]
*  They want all over the West Bank. [[01:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=5068.94s)]
*  They want all of Gaza. [[01:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=5070.34s)]
*  And they have said many times on television [[01:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=5071.18s)]
*  that the only way this would happen [[01:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=5073.74s)]
*  if people in Gaza go into Egypt [[01:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=5076.0199999999995s)]
*  and people in the West Bank are driven into Georgia. [[01:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=5078.62s)]
*  Is this a legitimate map? [[01:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=5081.86s)]
*  Did you draw this map? [[01:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=5082.7s)]
*  I did. [[01:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=5083.86s)]
*  I did check. [[01:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=5084.7s)]
*  It's from the internet. [[01:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=5085.54s)]
*  But they have been telling you openly, [[01:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=5087.26s)]
*  we're gonna displace you. [[01:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=5089.14s)]
*  But at a certain point, they have to recognize, [[01:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=5089.98s)]
*  hey, we haven't, this is- [[01:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=5091.62s)]
*  No, they don't care. [[01:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=5093.0599999999995s)]
*  They haven't, why would they- [[01:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=5093.9s)]
*  Well, now see, that's the part to me [[01:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=5094.74s)]
*  that's not cool, dude. [[01:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=5096.0199999999995s)]
*  Show me in this map anywhere where Israel has scaled back, [[01:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=5097.1s)]
*  what they have done, they have moved forward [[01:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=5100.780000000001s)]
*  to disintegrate the land more, [[01:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=5103.22s)]
*  push the people more, abuse the people more. [[01:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=5104.9800000000005s)]
*  And because they have the power, [[01:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=5107.5s)]
*  because they have America behind them, [[01:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=5109.02s)]
*  they are not compelled to do anything different. [[01:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=5111.1s)]
*  Well, they feel like they're in the right. [[01:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=5113.820000000001s)]
*  Yes, they feel in the right because it's given, [[01:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=5115.34s)]
*  but the Bible gave it to me because God gave it to me. [[01:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=5118.14s)]
*  So if I believe I'm the chosen people, [[01:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=5120.42s)]
*  I can do whatever I want. [[01:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=5123.46s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[01:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=5124.580000000001s)]
*  And I have to tell you, like a lot of people ask me, [[01:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=5125.42s)]
*  are you religious? [[01:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=5127.219999999999s)]
*  I say like, if these are God-chosen people, I have doubts. [[01:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=5128.0599999999995s)]
*  I'm gonna lose my job for two more years for laughing at all. [[01:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=5131.42s)]
*  But do you think though that, [[01:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=5137.98s)]
*  why doesn't America help Palestine? [[01:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=5140.179999999999s)]
*  Why don't we- [[01:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=5142.62s)]
*  Why? [[01:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=5143.46s)]
*  Because they help, I just told you, why would, [[01:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=5144.28s)]
*  what is America? [[01:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=5146.98s)]
*  America is a government. [[01:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=5147.82s)]
*  This government is made of officials. [[01:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=5148.66s)]
*  These officials are elected. [[01:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=5150.0199999999995s)]
*  They need money for the elections. [[01:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=5151.98s)]
*  Who pays for election campaigns? [[01:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=5153.34s)]
*  Who is the biggest- [[01:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=5155.259999999999s)]
*  You can still help someone because they need help. [[01:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=5156.5s)]
*  No, no, they don't care. [[01:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=5159.46s)]
*  Who is the biggest recipient of donors from Israel? [[01:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=5161.9400000000005s)]
*  Nine million dollars over the years, Joe Biden. [[01:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=5165.9800000000005s)]
*  Joe Biden, yeah. [[01:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=5169.22s)]
*  Yeah, so why would he help? [[01:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=5170.06s)]
*  Why would I help Palestine [[01:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=5171.58s)]
*  while I'm getting my money from you? [[01:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=5172.820000000001s)]
*  I mean, he can give me all kinds of like fancy political talk, [[01:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=5174.34s)]
*  but it's really about being re-elected. [[01:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=5177.620000000001s)]
*  So the idea, you are thinking as a human being, [[01:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=5180.06s)]
*  what is the right thing to do? [[01:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=5183.34s)]
*  And you're right. [[01:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=5185.54s)]
*  But the right thing to do is not the right thing in politics. [[01:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=5186.7s)]
*  The right thing in politics is to survive [[01:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=5189.42s)]
*  and have as much money as possible [[01:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=5191.22s)]
*  to stay in power as long as possible. [[01:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=5192.46s)]
*  No morals, no right and wrong, nothing, just power. [[01:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=5194.42s)]
*  Well, one thing that didn't help, [[01:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=5199.06s)]
*  by having the term free Palestine, that's gonna attract [[01:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=5200.34s)]
*  all the- [[01:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=5204.74s)]
*  But if you label something free something [[01:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=5205.7s)]
*  right next to Israel, dude, no wonder they keep coming. [[01:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=5207.38s)]
*  They should have said, [[01:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=5209.74s)]

*  oh, we're doing this for Palestinians. [[01:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=5417.3s)]
*  We will get rid of Hamas for them, [[01:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=5418.94s)]
*  and the Palestinians will be grateful. [[01:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=5422.22s)]
*  And then I see the destructions. [[01:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=5424.1s)]
*  I see that, yeah, there's a lot of Palestinians [[01:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=5426.3s)]

*  other than the nails that she does in the nail salon. [[01:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=5514.900000000001s)]
*  So she's like a normal human being. [[01:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=5516.900000000001s)]
*  And we have normal kids, [[01:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=5519.3s)]
*  and they don't turn into werewolves at night. [[01:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=5520.74s)]
*  They are normal people. [[01:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=5523.58s)]
*  They are normal people who have been in this land, [[01:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=5524.5s)]
*  and they were taken away from it. [[01:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=5526.22s)]
*  And this was a problem that was imported [[01:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=5527.26s)]
*  from a different continent, done by other perpetrators. [[01:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=5530.78s)]
*  They were rejected by other white people, [[01:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=5535.0199999999995s)]
*  and they were just put on us. [[01:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=5537.5s)]
*  And it is terrible, and it should not happen. [[01:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=5540.0199999999995s)]
*  So do Palestinians also have issues [[01:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=5542.42s)]
*  with Britain and the US then probably? [[01:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=5544.0199999999995s)]
*  Of course. [[01:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=5545.62s)]
*  But I don't think they have any time [[01:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=5546.46s)]
*  to have issues with anybody. [[01:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=5547.94s)]
*  They have time to survive. [[01:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=5548.86s)]
*  They're living in tents right now in Gaza, [[01:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=5549.94s)]
*  and the people who live in West Bank [[01:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=5551.62s)]
*  are under threat to be killed or kicked out at any moment. [[01:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=5553.0599999999995s)]
*  And I just want people to look at them as humans. [[01:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=5558.38s)]
*  Everybody who went to Gaza, [[01:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=5564.06s)]
*  everybody who went to West Bank, [[01:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=5565.3s)]
*  saw what happened to those people, [[01:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=5566.900000000001s)]
*  and they will speak of their being shut down. [[01:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=5568.1s)]
*  Are you able to look at Israel as humans too? [[01:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=5570.46s)]
*  Yes, but I look at everybody as humans, [[01:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=5573.46s)]
*  and I will not do the same mistake [[01:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=5577.06s)]
*  that they have been doing to us, [[01:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=5579.26s)]
*  dehumanizing us, calling us terrorists. [[01:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=5580.820000000001s)]
*  But they are acting like terrorists. [[01:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=5583.700000000001s)]
*  Why don't we give part of our country to Palestine? [[01:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=5585.5s)]
*  Why don't you give part of your country to Jewish people? [[01:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=5591.38s)]
*  Oh, yeah, why don't we give part of our country [[01:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=5595.54s)]
*  to one of the groups? [[01:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=5597.54s)]
*  At least that would help, do you think? [[01:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=5598.78s)]
*  Yeah, I think, maybe, but it's not... [[01:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=5599.62s)]
*  Or an island, what about that? [[01:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=5603.78s)]
*  What if you did a merger? [[01:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=5604.86s)]
*  You did Palestine. [[01:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=5606.5s)]
*  Palestine, that's a good one. [[01:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=5608.06s)]
*  Do you think that's possible? [[01:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=5610.38s)]
*  Would Palestine accept something like that [[01:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=5612.3s)]
*  where it's like, let's give this place... [[01:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=5614.26s)]
*  I'm not Palestinian, so I can also speak on their behalf, [[01:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=5617.54s)]
*  but I think Palestinians want to stay in their land. [[01:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=5619.74s)]
*  And I think many of those... [[01:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=5621.9400000000005s)]
*  This is what drives me crazy, [[01:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=5624.860000000001s)]
*  because it doesn't make any sense. [[01:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=5626.26s)]
*  Any Jewish person all around the world, [[01:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=5628.46s)]
*  if you're like a Polish Jewish, like an American Jewish, [[01:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=5630.34s)]
*  just because you're Jewish, [[01:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=5634.9800000000005s)]
*  you can get the Israeli passport right now, right now. [[01:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=5636.820000000001s)]
*  And once you get the passport, [[01:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=5640.14s)]
*  you can come from Brooklyn, land into Israel, [[01:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=5642.06s)]
*  take a piece of land that was owned by a Palestinian [[01:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=5644.780000000001s)]
*  right on the spot, or a home that is owned by a Palestinian [[01:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=5647.02s)]
*  saying that this is your promised land. [[01:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=5651.42s)]
*  Like what do you mean, you can walk into the house? [[01:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=5653.38s)]
*  Yeah, you can just walk in the house, [[01:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=5654.820000000001s)]
*  and you can have videos of people taking their stuff [[01:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=5656.700000000001s)]
*  and barging into a Palestinian home in the West Bank. [[01:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=5659.1s)]
*  It happens all the time. [[01:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=5662.22s)]
*  It doesn't make any sense. [[01:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=5663.42s)]
*  A Brooklyn Jew, just because he was born Jew, [[01:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=5665.06s)]
*  can just go to Israel, take the passport, [[01:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=5668.38s)]
*  and take a piece of land that is belonged to someone else, [[01:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=5670.9s)]
*  even now, as we speak. [[01:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=5673.38s)]
*  Does that make any sense? [[01:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=5674.98s)]
*  But most people wouldn't do that. [[01:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=5675.82s)]
*  Many people do that. [[01:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=5676.98s)]
*  Many people do that. [[01:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=5678.339999999999s)]
*  On every single given day, [[01:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=5679.62s)]
*  you have planes with thousands of Jewish people [[01:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=5681.74s)]
*  from all over the world coming from Eastern Europe, [[01:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=5683.74s)]
*  coming from Africa, coming from Latin America, [[01:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=5686.0599999999995s)]
*  coming from America, and settling in the land, [[01:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=5688.219999999999s)]
*  settling in Arab land. [[01:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=5690.78s)]
*  Does the Palestinian people, [[01:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=5693.099999999999s)]
*  do they have a police department? [[01:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=5694.5s)]
*  They have like... [[01:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=5696.299999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=5697.3s)]
*  They have something called the Palestinian Authority, [[01:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=5699.02s)]
*  which is an oxymoron. [[01:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=5701.42s)]
*  And they are called the Palestinian Authority, [[01:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=5703.26s)]
*  but show me an authority that has absolutely no say [[01:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=5706.42s)]
*  about the foreign people coming in [[01:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=5709.42s)]
*  and taking land from your people. [[01:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=5710.900000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=5712.22s)]
*  My friend got a job at the airport, [[01:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=5713.7s)]
*  and he was a little guy, right? [[01:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=5716.3s)]
*  And they gave him a billy club, [[01:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=5717.74s)]
*  and it weighed him down, but he was so little. [[01:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=5719.3s)]
*  He probably weighed 60 pounds, whatever. [[01:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=5721.5s)]
*  I think he's more effective [[01:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=5723.9400000000005s)]
*  more than the Palestinian Authority. [[01:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=5725.22s)]
*  He's more powerful than them. [[01:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=5727.66s)]
*  The club doing, you'd see him run. [[01:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=5728.5s)]
*  It was so... [[01:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=5730.0599999999995s)]
*  He almost had to run sideways [[01:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=5730.9s)]
*  because the way the club would like shuffle [[01:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=5732.5s)]
*  and like block his legs. [[01:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=5734.5s)]
*  Oh, I wish it was that funny. [[01:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=5735.62s)]
*  What's the solution? [[01:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=5737.0599999999995s)]
*  We had, there has to, you have to have some... [[01:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=5737.9s)]
*  The solution is to end the occupation, [[01:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=5740.299999999999s)]
*  and the solution is that Israel should stop [[01:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=5742.379999999999s)]
*  killing Palestinians taking their land. [[01:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=5744.219999999999s)]
*  It's as simple as that. [[01:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=5745.7s)]
*  Details, what land, how much, [[01:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=5746.82s)]
*  well, that's not my thing to say, [[01:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=5749.259999999999s)]
*  because I'm a comedian, not a politician, [[01:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=5750.86s)]
*  not a Palestinian. [[01:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=5752.5s)]
*  There are Palestinian politicians [[01:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=5753.459999999999s)]
*  that can talk on their behalf, [[01:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=5754.94s)]
*  but I can tell you whatever is happening now is wrong, [[01:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=5757.82s)]
*  and I'm not, it's not my problem [[01:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=5760.5s)]
*  or my issue to come up with a solution, [[01:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=5763.0199999999995s)]
*  because I didn't cause that crisis. [[01:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=5764.9s)]
*  It's someone else caused it, [[01:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=5766.74s)]
*  and it's not for me to fix it for them, [[01:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=5767.98s)]
*  but what I can say, what's happening is wrong. [[01:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=5769.82s)]
*  Are any American or British leaders, [[01:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=5773.179999999999s)]
*  and some of this stuff, I don't know a ton, you know? [[01:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=5775.78s)]
*  I'm trying my best to learn. [[01:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=5778.139999999999s)]
*  Is some American or British leaders [[01:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=5779.82s)]
*  trying to help negotiate that? [[01:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=5782.42s)]
*  Have we tried over the years to help? [[01:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=5784.42s)]
*  Yeah, but it's always been skewed towards Israel. [[01:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=5786.0199999999995s)]
*  Is that true, though? [[01:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=5789.179999999999s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[01:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=5790.0199999999995s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=5791.7s)]
*  Because both sides have rejected peace agreements, right? [[01:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=5792.54s)]
*  Yes, but one of them rejected it [[01:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=5795.219999999999s)]
*  because basically you're giving them a very shitty deal, [[01:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=5797.78s)]
*  and the other side rejected it because they want more. [[01:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=5800.259999999999s)]
*  And now they're telling you, it's like, [[01:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=5803.259999999999s)]
*  hey, you know what, forget about the second state. [[01:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=5804.46s)]
*  Forget about two-state solution. [[01:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=5807.0599999999995s)]

*  I don't know, there's no negotiation now. [[01:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=5820.82s)]
*  Israel hasn't gone to the negotiation table [[01:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=5822.5s)]
*  for the past 20 years. [[01:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=5824.14s)]
*  Like, is Gaza on Zillow? [[01:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=5825.18s)]
*  No. [[01:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=5826.94s)]

*  I think Zillow's like... [[01:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=5840.3s)]
*  I don't think so. [[01:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=5841.9800000000005s)]
*  It's Zillow. [[01:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=5843.22s)]
*  Here's the thing, if it's not on Zillow, [[01:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=5844.06s)]
*  I don't think you can take it. [[01:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=5846.46s)]
*  However, it's not in Zillow. [[01:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=5847.780000000001s)]
*  It's not, oh wow. [[01:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=5849.7s)]

*  I notice is they do a good job of working together. [[01:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=5853.42s)]
*  Jewish people are great business people. [[01:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=5857.42s)]
*  And I don't wanna kind of be the guy who's like, [[01:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=5859.14s)]
*  hey, I have black friends, but like, [[01:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=5862.7s)]
*  I honestly like my agents, my managers, [[01:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=5864.34s)]
*  and they all come from companies [[01:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=5866.860000000001s)]
*  that are overwhelmingly Jewish people. [[01:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=5869.14s)]
*  And I have no problem with dealing with that. [[01:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=5871.14s)]
*  My utmost friend and the guy that I look up to [[01:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=5872.5s)]
*  is John Stewart. [[01:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=5880.740000000001s)]
*  And he's the reason why I'm known to America. [[01:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=5881.900000000001s)]
*  When I came on his show, he came to my show. [[01:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=5883.900000000001s)]
*  I love him to death. [[01:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=5885.42s)]
*  He's my big brother and he's Jewish. [[01:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=5886.26s)]
*  That's why I don't fall into this like Jewish, Jewish, [[01:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=5888.26s)]
*  Jewish thing. [[01:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=5891.780000000001s)]
*  Now, there are just like bad people that happen to be Jewish [[01:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=5892.62s)]
*  and there's bad people that happen to be Muslims. [[01:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=5895.1s)]
*  There are bad people that happen to be Christians. [[01:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=5897.14s)]
*  And there are bad people that happen to be atheists. [[01:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=5899.42s)]
*  I don't look through the lens of religion, [[01:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=5900.58s)]
*  but I can see people who would use religion [[01:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=5903.58s)]
*  in order to advance their policy. [[01:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=5906.099999999999s)]
*  The same way that ISIS and Qadda used Islam [[01:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=5908.0199999999995s)]
*  in order to promote themselves as the only speakers of Islam, [[01:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=5909.94s)]
*  we as Muslims rejected it. [[01:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=5912.62s)]
*  And the way that Israel is speaking [[01:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=5913.94s)]
*  on behalf of all Jewish people, [[01:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=5915.38s)]
*  Jewish people, a lot of Jewish people are rejecting that [[01:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=5916.86s)]
*  because it's not anti-Semitism to attack Israel. [[01:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=5919.7s)]
*  It's not anti-Semitism to criticize Zionism. [[01:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=5922.099999999999s)]
*  It's just like freedom of expression. [[01:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=5925.0199999999995s)]
*  And that's why I don't hold it. [[01:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=5926.74s)]
*  But they wanna reduce you. [[01:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=5928.42s)]
*  You're a Jew hater. [[01:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=5929.62s)]
*  Dude, relax, I'm not. [[01:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=5930.74s)]
*  Yeah, I don't like when people say that sort of thing. [[01:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=5932.02s)]
*  Yeah, it's a way to shut down the conversation, [[01:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=5935.42s)]
*  to scare you, to intimidate you, [[01:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=5937.46s)]
*  to make people have like a negative reaction to you [[01:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=5938.86s)]
*  without even you speaking. [[01:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=5940.82s)]
*  Dude, if I hated Jewish people, I would know. [[01:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=5942.1s)]

*  You go to New York and not eat bagels, you know. [[01:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=5948.82s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=5951.14s)]

*  Your boy called Bagels in New York. [[01:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=5954.78s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=5957.02s)]
*  I don't do that, dude. [[01:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=5958.02s)]

*  Yeah, many times, many times. [[01:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=5962.660000000001s)]
*  And some of them listen, [[01:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=5964.46s)]
*  some of them are set in their ways, like anything. [[01:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=5965.740000000001s)]
*  Like, that's true for Americans, for Egyptians. [[01:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=5968.42s)]
*  I have debates about their Egyptian revolution [[01:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=5972.620000000001s)]
*  with Egyptian friends who would never listen [[01:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=5974.9400000000005s)]
*  to my point of view. [[01:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=5976.9800000000005s)]
*  So yes, it's a very emotionally charged topic. [[01:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=5978.06s)]
*  So you will have people coming in very emotional [[01:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=5981.46s)]
*  and they will not want to hear. [[01:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=5984.14s)]

*  Have you heard a good solution idea from a friend? [[01:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=5988.66s)]
*  No, a solution is end the occupation [[01:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=5991.139999999999s)]
*  and treat everybody living in that land equally. [[01:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=5993.34s)]
*  Don't treat them as sub-humans. [[01:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=5997.54s)]

*  and the human destruction that's happening over there [[01:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=6118.22s)]
*  and just the videos of people being maimed [[01:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=6120.860000000001s)]
*  and brutalized on both sides over there, [[01:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=6124.780000000001s)]
*  as a surgeon, that must make you feel some type of way too. [[01:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=6128.58s)]
*  Yeah, and there's a lot of surgeons and doctors [[01:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=6131.1s)]
*  who've been to Gaza and they come back with horrible stories. [[01:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=6132.86s)]
*  Really? [[01:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=6134.94s)]
*  Because, yeah, they're all over there, they tell you. [[01:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=6135.78s)]
*  Because every single hospital in Gaza is bombed. [[01:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=6137.78s)]
*  36 hospitals, all of them destroyed. [[01:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=6140.74s)]
*  They have maternity wards and incubators being killed. [[01:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=6143.98s)]
*  They have basically a place that has no basic needs [[01:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=6147.5s)]
*  and you're bombing the shit out of them every day. [[01:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=6150.86s)]
*  And you say, oh, we couldn't get Hamas. [[01:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=6153.139999999999s)]
*  It's like Israel, I think the IDF [[01:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=6156.58s)]
*  would be the worst in playing Jenga. [[01:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=6159.42s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=6161.58s)]
*  And you're like, okay, this is a terrorist. [[01:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=6162.7s)]
*  Ah, the whole region went down. [[01:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=6164.1s)]
*  Well, you do think that if the army is that acute, [[01:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=6168.58s)]
*  that they would be able to be more articulate. [[01:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=6172.78s)]
*  You mean like killing people less discriminately? [[01:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=6176.5s)]
*  Just like getting exactly whoever Hamas is. [[01:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=6179.86s)]
*  They can, they can, but they don't care. [[01:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=6182.86s)]
*  Because we have seen them on video killing babies. [[01:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=6184.5s)]
*  We cannot just tell me it's by mistake [[01:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=6189.1s)]
*  when you have babies with sniper bullets in their head. [[01:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=6191.02s)]
*  Right? Twice. [[01:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=6193.9800000000005s)]

*  You can say, oh, we trying our best. [[01:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=6196.9800000000005s)]
*  And then you blow up an empty hospital [[01:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=6198.820000000001s)]
*  or an empty school just for spite. [[01:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=6202.42s)]

*  And you keep, and you cannot have a war [[01:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=6208.820000000001s)]
*  when 80% of the people are displaced, [[01:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=6212.3s)]

*  It's just, you can't, you can't. [[01:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=6224.82s)]
*  This is not war. [[01:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=6225.86s)]
*  This is annihilation. [[01:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=6226.7s)]

*  They just, in the rural areas around, [[01:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=6251.26s)]
*  they wanna push them into Sinai, [[01:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=6253.38s)]

*  as a refugee school in Gaza, [[01:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=6263.3s)]
*  that the moment that they were playing football [[01:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=6266.0199999999995s)]
*  and Israel just dropped the bomb [[01:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=6267.98s)]
*  and they were playing football. [[01:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=6269.5s)]
*  Let me read this. [[01:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=6270.62s)]
*  Israel launched the war in Gaza [[01:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=6271.46s)]
*  after Hamas October 7th attack [[01:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=6272.98s)]
*  in which militants stormed into Israel, [[01:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=6275.099999999999s)]
*  killed some 1200 people, mostly civilians, [[01:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=6277.3s)]
*  and abducted about 250. [[01:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=6279.18s)]
*  Since then, Israeli ground offensives and bombardments [[01:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=6280.62s)]
*  have killed more than 38,000 people in Gaza. [[01:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=6282.74s)]
*  According to the territory's health ministry, [[01:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=6285.900000000001s)]
*  it does not distinguish between combatants [[01:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=6287.5s)]
*  and civilians in its count. [[01:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=6289.18s)]
*  Wow. [[01:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=6290.54s)]
*  But yeah, that's the video. [[01:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=6293.9800000000005s)]
*  They were playing football, this is like a refugee camp. [[01:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=6296.900000000001s)]
*  And then the moment- [[01:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=6299.820000000001s)]
*  What is a refugee camp? [[01:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=6300.74s)]
*  A refugee school. [[01:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=6301.66s)]
*  They're like, inside guys, they're all, see? [[01:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=6302.74s)]
*  Oh. [[01:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=6307.9800000000005s)]
*  That's every single day. [[01:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=6309.820000000001s)]
*  Every single day. [[01:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=6312.54s)]
*  That's every single day. [[01:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=6314.38s)]
*  In schools and hospitals, every single day. [[01:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=6316.54s)]
*  They just happened two days ago. [[01:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=6320.820000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=6322.1s)]
*  Man. [[01:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=6323.820000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I don't know. [[01:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=6325.22s)]
*  I just remember when I was a kid, [[01:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=6328.14s)]
*  my mom would say sometimes, [[01:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=6329.66s)]
*  like, I don't know why we're sending Israel all this money. [[01:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=6330.9800000000005s)]
*  You know? [[01:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=6333.9400000000005s)]
*  But she never liked Netanyahu. [[01:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=6334.78s)]
*  Yeah, but whether Netanyahu or Moniak, [[01:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=6337.66s)]
*  we said- [[01:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=6339.5s)]
*  She said he looks like a bad guy. [[01:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=6340.34s)]
*  We send money to Israel even before Netanyahu. [[01:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=6341.7s)]
*  The question is, there is just like a lot of questions [[01:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=6344.26s)]
*  and we need to be able to ask these questions [[01:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=6346.5s)]
*  without having fear of being canceled or destroyed [[01:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=6348.9800000000005s)]
*  or having our career taken away from us. [[01:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=6351.820000000001s)]
*  Wow, we fucking threw that out the window this episode. [[01:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=6352.78s)]
*  I don't think you did anything wrong, Theo. [[01:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=6354.900000000001s)]
*  Theo, you did well, man. [[01:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=6356.9800000000005s)]
*  Even listening though, sometimes. [[01:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=6358.18s)]
*  No, even listening now, you're afraid of listening? [[01:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=6359.18s)]
*  What happened to our American freedoms? [[01:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=6362.62s)]
*  It disintegrated to being afraid of listening. [[01:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=6364.74s)]
*  Oh, as a human being, I'm okay. [[01:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=6366.86s)]
*  I think just my life, [[01:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=6368.66s)]
*  I get worried about being able to still do my job. [[01:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=6369.86s)]
*  You did nothing wrong, Theo. [[01:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=6372.34s)]
*  You got a guy who spoke his mind, [[01:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=6373.82s)]
*  which is what Americans are- [[01:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=6375.98s)]
*  I agree. [[01:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=6378.42s)]
*  You just gave me a platform to speak out my mind [[01:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=6379.26s)]
*  and you're bringing someone else [[01:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=6381.9s)]
*  who will say the opposite of what I'm gonna say. [[01:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=6383.22s)]
*  It's gonna be up to people to decide. [[01:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=6385.3s)]
*  How do you support your Jewish friends [[01:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=6387.26s)]
*  just in the US and stuff or whatever [[01:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=6389.099999999999s)]

*  Is that kind of tough sometimes? [[01:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=6393.42s)]
*  It is tough for them. [[01:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=6394.9s)]
*  I have a lot of Jewish friends who are in disagreement [[01:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=6396.219999999999s)]
*  with their parents who are pretty much Zionists [[01:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=6398.82s)]
*  and they don't agree with that. [[01:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=6401.419999999999s)]

*  Just give me one more. [[01:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=6404.299999999999s)]
*  Okay, according to Jewish people, Zionist people, [[01:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=6405.379999999999s)]
*  it is just simply having a national state of Israel [[01:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=6408.379999999999s)]
*  in the Middle East. [[01:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=6413.58s)]
*  That's the base. [[01:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=6414.9s)]

*  This is what they tell you, just the establishment. [[01:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=6420.419999999999s)]
*  But for us, they have done that [[01:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=6422.9s)]
*  by displacing people, colonizing their land [[01:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=6424.3s)]
*  and taking away their homes, taking away their land. [[01:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=6426.9800000000005s)]
*  For us, Zionism is not good. [[01:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=6429.1s)]
*  Okay, for who? [[01:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=6431.34s)]
*  For Arabs and Muslims because they took a land [[01:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=6432.9400000000005s)]
*  from Palestinians under the pretense of this thing [[01:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=6436.02s)]
*  and then they tell you, it's de-colonization. [[01:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=6439.42s)]
*  If Israel moved out of the territory there, [[01:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=6441.74s)]
*  do you think that another group would move right into it? [[01:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=6444.1s)]
*  No, I don't think. [[01:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=6448.1s)]
*  There's seven or eight million Jews in Israel. [[01:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=6449.9400000000005s)]
*  That's a lot of people to move out. [[01:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=6455.02s)]
*  Right, but I'm just saying, say if that was vacated, [[01:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=6456.5s)]
*  would Syrians or Egyptians or somebody else [[01:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=6458.860000000001s)]
*  cruise right in there? [[01:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=6461.780000000001s)]
*  No, because there are already Palestinians there. [[01:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=6462.62s)]
*  How many Palestinians live in Israel? [[01:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=6464.46s)]
*  Okay, there are 3.5 million who live in the West Bank, [[01:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=6466.5s)]
*  2.3 million live in Gaza, so a total of eight. [[01:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=6471.900000000001s)]
*  Inside Israel, in the territory, there are two million. [[01:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=6475.820000000001s)]
*  Palestinians live in Israel. [[01:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=6479.820000000001s)]
*  Seven million Palestinians who live outside refugees. [[01:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=6482.58s)]
*  And where is one of the largest spaces [[01:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=6486.94s)]
*  of Palestinians outside of? [[01:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=6488.7s)]
*  Jordan. [[01:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=6490.42s)]
*  Jordan. [[01:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=6491.38s)]
*  Jordan. [[01:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=6492.22s)]
*  What about in America? [[01:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=6493.0599999999995s)]
*  No, maybe they are like half of them. [[01:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=6493.94s)]
*  Maybe Michigan? [[01:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=6495.18s)]
*  No, no, no. [[01:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=6496.0199999999995s)]
*  Michigan, there's a lot of Muslims, [[01:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=6497.54s)]
*  but many of them are Lebanese, many of them are Iraqis. [[01:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=6499.46s)]
*  Some of them are Palestinians. [[01:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=6501.82s)]
*  I think they are about 400,000 in America. [[01:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=6502.98s)]
*  A total of seven million outside of Palestine. [[01:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=6508.58s)]
*  Seven million. [[01:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=6513.58s)]
*  Some of them are refugees, some of them are citizens [[01:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=6514.419999999999s)]
*  of other countries now. [[01:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=6516.5s)]
*  How much longer do you think Palestine? [[01:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=6518.219999999999s)]
*  I see, 175. [[01:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=6519.379999999999s)]
*  Oh, 175,000 Palestinian Americans. [[01:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=6520.94s)]
*  In America, yeah. [[01:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=6522.62s)]
*  That's like 0.05, they're very small. [[01:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=6524.0199999999995s)]
*  Some of them are on Wilshire every other Saturday. [[01:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=6526.459999999999s)]
*  Hey, yeah. [[01:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=6528.66s)]
*  You wanna talk about? [[01:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=6529.5s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, three of them. [[01:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=6530.339999999999s)]
*  Some of them have the best restaurants here. [[01:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=6531.86s)]
*  Well, yeah, I'm super glad we got to talk about it. [[01:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=6535.56s)]
*  Sorry if some stuff I was kinda like, [[01:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=6541.04s)]
*  trying to like, you know, I just, I think some stuff [[01:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=6543.28s)]
*  I don't know what, if it's like, [[01:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=6546.16s)]
*  I don't know what to say, I guess. [[01:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=6547.88s)]
*  And sometimes I just listen, [[01:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=6549.2s)]
*  cause I don't know how to like, [[01:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=6550.24s)]
*  some conversations I just, [[01:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=6552.24s)]
*  you just don't know what to say or do. [[01:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=6553.36s)]
*  Yeah, and I understand because for Americans, [[01:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=6555.84s)]
*  Americans have so much to worry about. [[01:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=6557.72s)]
*  They have to worry about their own daily life [[01:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=6559.32s)]
*  and their own like paying their bills. [[01:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=6561.36s)]
*  And then it's like, why do we have to care [[01:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=6563.0s)]
*  about this remote place in the Middle East [[01:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=6564.36s)]
*  that we will never see? [[01:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=6566.679999999999s)]
*  And now why is it? [[01:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=6567.599999999999s)]
*  Yeah, it's a great question. [[01:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=6568.44s)]
*  This is like an everyday. [[01:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=6569.28s)]
*  This is an everyday, this is an everyday. [[01:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=6570.679999999999s)]
*  Why do we have, and I feel for them. [[01:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=6572.28s)]
*  But the reason why Americans should care about that, [[01:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=6574.24s)]
*  because that is affecting our government, [[01:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=6577.5599999999995s)]
*  our democracy, our way of life. [[01:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=6581.0s)]
*  Because if you're an American, [[01:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=6583.799999999999s)]
*  you think this is remotely, they're more from you. [[01:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=6585.679999999999s)]
*  No, it doesn't because it affects the way [[01:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=6588.16s)]
*  that you speak about politics. [[01:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=6589.5599999999995s)]
*  You hear many times, you say, [[01:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=6590.799999999999s)]
*  I don't know if I'm going to go to jail. [[01:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=6592.16s)]
*  Well, if you talk about something that's happening [[01:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=6593.76s)]
*  that foreign, you shouldn't be worried about going to jail. [[01:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=6597.16s)]
*  You should be worried about talking about the government [[01:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=6600.16s)]
*  giving that much money for destruction. [[01:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=6603.280000000001s)]
*  So it affects you. [[01:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=6606.320000000001s)]
*  Whether you like it or not, it affects you. [[01:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=6608.12s)]
*  Yeah, I think one of the bigger problems that we have [[01:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=6610.76s)]
*  is that we facilitate so much war and weaponry in the world [[01:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=6612.8s)]
*  to try and leverage things. [[01:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=6618.56s)]
*  But then maybe that needs to happen for us [[01:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=6620.64s)]
*  to have the safety we have and maybe we're, you know, [[01:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=6623.12s)]
*  it's just, it's hard to know all that stuff, [[01:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=6628.16s)]
*  how one thing affects the other. [[01:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=6629.88s)]
*  But you see, I find that this is actually the end result [[01:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=6631.64s)]
*  of every conversation. [[01:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=6634.2s)]
*  Oh, we don't know, maybe this is what will happen [[01:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=6635.12s)]
*  just in order, but that's like a way to stay complacent. [[01:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=6637.16s)]
*  Yeah, that's a good point. [[01:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=6640.5199999999995s)]
*  Because what is happening is not right. [[01:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=6641.599999999999s)]
*  All of this money, all of these billions of dollars [[01:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=6643.64s)]
*  coming up from our pockets, that is not right. [[01:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=6645.84s)]
*  And I'm talking about money, politics, and freedom. [[01:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=6648.84s)]
*  These are the three things that are the cornerstones [[01:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=6651.8s)]
*  of American life. [[01:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=6653.64s)]
*  Our politics, our freedom, our money. [[01:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=6654.4800000000005s)]
*  If we don't know where our money is going and why, [[01:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=6656.12s)]
*  and why is our politics is being taken over [[01:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=6658.12s)]
*  by a foreign lobby, that is wrong. [[01:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=6661.8s)]
*  And you need to start from there. [[01:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=6667.28s)]
*  Yeah, it just breaks my heart. [[01:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=6669.76s)]
*  I mean, I just, you see what happened is over there [[01:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=6671.04s)]
*  and it's heartbreaking and it's like, well, Hadi, [[01:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=6673.2s)]
*  yeah, I just wanted to learn a little bit more about it [[01:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=6675.08s)]
*  and I wanted to get some perspective from somebody [[01:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=6676.76s)]
*  that was at least able to speak about it [[01:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=6678.4s)]
*  and who was willing to speak up about it. [[01:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=6682.12s)]
*  You know, and you've spoken vibrantly about it. [[01:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=6683.5199999999995s)]
*  And I understand how difficult it is [[01:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=6686.16s)]
*  because maybe some of your listeners or your audience [[01:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=6687.48s)]
*  don't really care about that stuff. [[01:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=6689.639999999999s)]
*  And maybe for them, this is too heavy. [[01:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=6691.44s)]
*  But for the people who are interested, [[01:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=6693.48s)]
*  what you did is to bring a problem that affects us, [[01:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=6695.48s)]
*  whether we like it or not, [[01:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=6699.36s)]
*  and I'm happy that you're bringing a rabbi to speak [[01:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=6701.04s)]
*  on a totally opposite level. [[01:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=6705.16s)]
*  And I'm happy that when people have more questions, [[01:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=6707.24s)]
*  you bring more people to speak to you. [[01:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=6709.12s)]
*  I'm happy to come back again and talk to the people. [[01:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=6710.72s)]
*  And because at the end of the day, [[01:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=6713.44s)]
*  you listen not just for entertainment, but for education. [[01:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=6714.639999999999s)]
*  And there's so many things in that world that I don't know. [[01:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=6717.36s)]
*  So I listen to shows that will tell me. [[01:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=6719.2s)]
*  So I just want, I'm not here to attack anybody. [[01:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=6721.88s)]
*  I'm not here to say bad things about anybody. [[01:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=6725.08s)]
*  I'm here to just invite people to be more curious [[01:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=6728.16s)]
*  and to understand how things work [[01:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=6732.04s)]
*  and to form their own opinion [[01:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=6734.44s)]
*  and not just give up to, oh, this is the way it is. [[01:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=6736.48s)]
*  We can't change anything. [[01:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXmln1eydQ&t=6739.48s)]
