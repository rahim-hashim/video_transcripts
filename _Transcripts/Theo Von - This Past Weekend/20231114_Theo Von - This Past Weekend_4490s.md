*  Well, we had Sexy Red on and she's from the hood, right? [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=74.0s)]
*  She has some pretty ratchet stuff. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=77.0s)]
*  She sings about like her vagina stuff, but people love her, right? [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=78.0s)]

*  She, yeah. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=84.0s)]
*  And she is actually pregnant as well. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=85.0s)]
*  The best part of it was at the end, I was like, hey, I'm going to invite you to a UFC fight sometimes. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=88.0s)]
*  She's like, I'd love to go. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=92.0s)]
*  That would be awesome. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=94.0s)]
*  So the hood would really show up for that. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=95.0s)]
*  What did you think about Slap? [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=97.0s)]
*  Well, it's a great question, brother. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=99.0s)]
*  First of all, I didn't know what being there makes it. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=101.0s)]
*  You're like, oh, my God, this is amazing. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=106.0s)]
*  I like how it's bite size in the way that if you want to like hang out with friends and chat, you can be talking to your buddy and you know exactly when the action is going to happen. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=110.0s)]
*  So as whereas UFC, you don't want to miss any of the dance. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=120.0s)]
*  That's a really good point. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=123.0s)]
*  So I loved how it was like very digestible. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=124.0s)]
*  Like in, OK, it's like, hold on, dude, chill. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=127.0s)]
*  Let's focus. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=129.0s)]
*  This is it. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=130.0s)]
*  I like the people that were there. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=131.0s)]
*  I thought was really interesting. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=134.0s)]
*  I can't tell when I'm there. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=136.0s)]
*  There's moments where I'm supporting and then there's moments where I'm heckling almost. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=138.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=142.0s)]
*  There's respect for sure. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=143.0s)]
*  But I like I don't know. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=145.0s)]
*  It was weird like cow like Cowboy Ceroni's here and he's like, knock him out them slides like one guys wearing sandals. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=147.0s)]
*  So I think there's a little bit of a peanut gallery aspect. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=153.0s)]
*  There is. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=156.0s)]
*  But there is a UFC, too, though. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=157.0s)]
*  I mean, there's a lot of a lot of yelling and shit talking at UFC. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=159.0s)]
*  I think UFC has become a lot more sophisticated over the like the last 10 years. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=163.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=168.0s)]
*  But before that, it was quite a slap crowd. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=169.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=172.0s)]
*  Oh, well, dude, I remember when I first heard about UFC, it was like the kids who were not going to finish school were watching it. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=173.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=181.0s)]
*  It was like they had a VHS. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=182.0s)]
*  It would like come in the mail. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=183.0s)]
*  That dude. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=185.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=186.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=187.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=188.0s)]
*  Yeah, that talk about a guy that's become famous just off fucking one pitcher of sitting in the crowd. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=189.0s)]
*  Just bleed. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=194.0s)]
*  He works with blood drives now, too, which is crazy. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=195.0s)]
*  Are you serious? [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=197.0s)]
*  No, I'm not. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=198.0s)]
*  But that would be. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=199.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=200.0s)]
*  But actually, it's not a bad partnership. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=201.0s)]
*  Dude, I'd fucking I'd pour 12 ounce negative for that guy if you ask me. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=203.0s)]
*  Oh, that's funny. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=207.0s)]
*  I'll tell you something fascinating about the slap content. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=209.0s)]
*  So there's a there's a woman named Amy Kaplan, and she's she's a media member. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=212.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=216.0s)]
*  And I don't know who she writes for, but she comes to everything. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=217.0s)]
*  UFC Slap. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=220.0s)]
*  She supports whatever. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=221.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=222.0s)]
*  So when she showed up to slap on on Wednesday, she had 20 followers on TikTok. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=223.0s)]
*  So she posted the video of Sheena, the women's one. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=229.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=233.0s)]
*  Knocking her out. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=234.0s)]
*  Right now, it's at one point six million views, and she has thirty six hundred followers off one post from slab. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=235.0s)]
*  How crazy is that? [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=243.0s)]
*  This is the one right here. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=245.0s)]
*  Yeah, you should you should have cut that up and put that that's all the all the influencers that come. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=246.0s)]
*  They love it because the content so powerful. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=251.0s)]
*  Listen to me. If you take the NFL, the NBA, Major League Baseball, the NHL, UFC, WWE, NASCAR, Formula One, PGA and a couple other ones. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=256.0s)]
*  You combine all their numbers together on social, multiply them by four. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=265.0s)]
*  They don't do a power slap. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=269.0s)]
*  No way. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=270.0s)]
*  Fucking fact. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=272.0s)]
*  And when you post this content, it is unbelievably powerful, man. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=273.0s)]
*  Yeah. Other things that I thought really about it. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=278.0s)]
*  I liked how I wish I knew some of the fighters better. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=280.0s)]
*  I know some of that takes time and get to know them. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=284.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=286.0s)]
*  This is only our fifth ever event. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=287.0s)]
*  It's been around for eight months. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=288.0s)]
*  And yeah, no, this thing's a fucking juggernaut, though, man. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=290.0s)]
*  But I dug it, dude. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=293.0s)]
*  I'm sitting there with my buddy Sheldon Sorey and we're like, holy shit, dude, this is so much fun. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=294.0s)]
*  I was like, I was excited to come back. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=300.0s)]
*  It's not going to say it surprised me, but it did when the guy like almost got a haircut off of his beard. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=302.0s)]
*  You don't even know if he has a chin. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=308.0s)]
*  You're like, what if that dude doesn't even have a chin and he should fucking out here? [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=309.0s)]
*  That's one of the things we've been talking about. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=314.0s)]
*  You know, some of these beards are so big. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=316.0s)]
*  It's not where the hell the face is. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=319.0s)]
*  I agree. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=321.0s)]
*  That's hilarious. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=322.0s)]
*  But I kind of love that aspect of it. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=323.0s)]
*  It's a little bit of camouflage, dude, where some guy rolls out there with a naked chin, some little fucking nude. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=324.0s)]
*  You know, like this guy's got to calm down. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=329.0s)]
*  This pervert puts him grow a beard, man. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=332.0s)]
*  Did you did you make it up to Red Rock after? [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=334.0s)]
*  No, I didn't. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=336.0s)]
*  It was fucking mayhem up there. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=337.0s)]
*  Really? Yeah. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=339.0s)]
*  We go to the high limit room after and big party up there at Red Rock after the thing and everybody's gambling and all this shit. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=340.0s)]
*  But we had done this thing. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=347.0s)]
*  We did a sweepstakes where somebody would get the opportunity to come in and gamble with me and Steve will do it. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=349.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=355.0s)]

*  With John Chihita. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=655.0s)]
*  Are you guys doing that thing? [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=656.0s)]
*  I'm doing Nitro Circus. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=657.0s)]
*  I'm doing Nitro Circus tomorrow. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=658.0s)]
*  I'm going to go. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=659.0s)]
*  Oh, it's tomorrow. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=660.0s)]
*  It's tomorrow in Anaheim. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=661.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=662.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=663.0s)]
*  I have a show. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=664.0s)]
*  I actually I'm meeting Trump tomorrow morning for breakfast on his plane. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=665.0s)]
*  Wow. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=668.0s)]
*  So the plane is landing here. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=669.0s)]
*  We're going to have breakfast on his plane. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=670.0s)]
*  Then I'm jumping on our plane and going to Nitro Circus. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=671.8s)]
*  Oh, that's going to be fun. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=676.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=677.76s)]
*  I wanted to be over there. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=678.76s)]
*  What does Trump have for breakfast? [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=679.76s)]
*  You think if you have breakfast, I'll tell you tomorrow. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=680.76s)]
*  OK. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=682.76s)]
*  OK. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=683.76s)]
*  Tomorrow. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=684.76s)]
*  All right. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=685.76s)]
*  What what would your walkout song be? [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=686.76s)]
*  You think if you were a fighter. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=687.76s)]
*  Oh, shit. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=688.76s)]
*  There's so many good ones to choose from. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=691.76s)]
*  I sort of lived vicariously through the through the athletes over the last, you know, however [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=693.4s)]
*  many years because I picked a lot of the songs for a lot of these guys to walk out [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=698.44s)]
*  to. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=702.0s)]
*  Do some of them just not want to pick it? [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=703.0s)]
*  Some don't even give a fuck. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=704.0s)]
*  What? [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=705.0s)]
*  Who care? [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=706.0s)]
*  Last like they could die. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=707.0s)]
*  They're not even going to know what music's on the way there. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=708.0s)]
*  Nope. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=710.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=711.0s)]
*  Most most of them didn't even care in the early days. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=712.0s)]
*  And you can't die on it with Hillary Duff when you're going to the fucking war. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=713.6400000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=717.2s)]
*  No, most of the music that was picked back in the day was done by me. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=718.2s)]
*  And but but the walkout song is important. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=721.2800000000001s)]
*  It's a big deal. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=724.34s)]
*  It's one of the things that if you're not a big star already and the song comes on and [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=725.4s)]
*  people connect with the song and like it, they're like, oh, who's this guy? [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=729.28s)]
*  It's a big deal. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=732.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=733.84s)]
*  Bobby Green, I think, does it pretty well. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=734.84s)]
*  I notice he'll kind of change his up and he brings so much energy, you know, but I think [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=735.84s)]
*  you can feel his energy when he's coming in. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=738.84s)]
*  Poirier has that James Brown. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=740.88s)]
*  You know, some of these fighters come up with songs that I would never dream of could be [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=744.6s)]
*  a cool walk in song. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=748.64s)]
*  Yeah, the walk in song is a fun but very important part of the the live event. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=750.68s)]
*  Yeah, I think so. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=756.4799999999999s)]
*  Man, I want to. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=757.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=758.68s)]
*  And I want to say, too, man, just your bravery and doing and keeping things going during [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=759.68s)]
*  the pandemic, it changed everything. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=762.68s)]
*  It gave a lot of people a feeling like that there was still somebody that could do something [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=764.68s)]
*  different. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=768.3199999999999s)]
*  It gave a lot of people a feeling that like everybody wasn't subject to kind of like the [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=769.3199999999999s)]
*  privatized tyranny that's kind of going on. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=776.3199999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=778.92s)]
*  I agree with you. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=780.36s)]
*  And man, it made it made me so much more of an involved fan, dude. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=781.36s)]
*  That's awesome. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=784.5999999999999s)]
*  Well, I appreciate it. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=785.5999999999999s)]
*  Listen, the pandemic never made sense to me. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=786.5999999999999s)]
*  And again, because of my close relationship with Abu Dhabi, you know, I knew over there [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=789.4s)]
*  that they were doing testing and they were doing all this stuff. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=793.9599999999999s)]
*  I'm like, if they can do it, why can't we do it over here? [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=796.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=799.12s)]
*  And why couldn't we create, you know, this space? [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=800.12s)]
*  You know, they ended up calling them the bubble, but this space where, you know, everybody was [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=803.0s)]
*  tested and you knew everybody was clean and we couldn't put on an event. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=808.1999999999999s)]
*  We did it in Jacksonville. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=810.88s)]
*  We did it in Abu Dhabi. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=812.24s)]
*  And, you know, I'm one of these guys. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=813.7199999999999s)]
*  I love this country. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=816.28s)]
*  I love America. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=817.36s)]
*  This country has obviously been very good to me, my family and a lot of my friends and [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=819.92s)]
*  employees. We don't just fucking roll over and hide in this country, man. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=824.8399999999999s)]
*  This whole pacification of America and everybody, you know, fucking scared of everything [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=830.04s)]
*  and whatever. I was like, if this is as bad as they think it is or they're saying it is [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=835.64s)]
*  fucking dead anyway. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=841.1999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, we're going to die. You don't want to die yet. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=842.48s)]
*  Just wearing a mask. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=844.24s)]
*  They can't even see your face. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=845.72s)]
*  Yeah. Dying in a mask, hiding in your house. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=847.08s)]
*  Oh, hell no. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=849.24s)]
*  So what do you think your walkout song would be? [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=851.36s)]
*  Look, can it just be the cult? [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=853.12s)]
*  Sure. I do the cult. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=854.4s)]
*  I do the cult. She sells sanctuary or listen, you know when you can never go wrong [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=857.04s)]
*  with a walkout song? ACDC. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=863.0s)]
*  Yeah. You never go wrong with ACDC. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=864.9599999999999s)]
*  I'm trying to think of an ACDC song. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=868.4399999999999s)]
*  I'm a little back in black. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=869.9599999999999s)]
*  Yeah. For those about the rock. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=871.0799999999999s)]
*  Oh, that's the shit. My brother used to beat the shit out of all that music. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=875.24s)]
*  Exactly. Oh, dude, I'm good ass whooping music. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=878.4399999999999s)]
*  Oh, I still I have a floating rib that was originally not floating because of half of [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=880.88s)]
*  Alice in Chains' second album. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=886.64s)]
*  Down there. Oh, big Alice in Chains fan. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=889.64s)]
*  We would lose. Well, one time I go over to Perry Farrell's house, right? [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=894.24s)]
*  I relapsed. First of all, I relapsed at a one year old's birthday party. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=897.12s)]
*  So obviously I've had some tough times. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=900.36s)]
*  But I got a friend of mine who's in jail now, I think. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=902.6800000000001s)]
*  But at the time he had a child, a friend of mine had a party at Perry Farrell's house [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=906.88s)]
*  because he had a nice home and it was a one year old's birthday. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=910.9200000000001s)]
*  And I go in and I didn't know who Perry Farrell was. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=913.96s)]
*  I'd listen to him. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=916.24s)]
*  You know, I just couldn't recognize him. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=917.8000000000001s)]
*  And then I'm just there's this dude kind of just mumbling around by this big bookcase. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=919.84s)]
*  And I go there. I'm fucking talking to the dude about these different books. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=923.56s)]
*  And it ended up being him. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=927.4399999999999s)]
*  Anyway, the story is anti-chromatic. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=928.9599999999999s)]
*  But yeah, I met him at a one year old's birthday party. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=930.52s)]
*  Neither one of us knew the child, which I think also made it weird. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=932.64s)]
*  And we talked about that a little. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=935.16s)]
*  It's weird to be at a really small kid's birthday and pretend that he's bigger or something. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=937.64s)]
*  Right. You know, what is that? [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=941.64s)]
*  Sinead. Oh, that's Sinead. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=944.7199999999999s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah, that's that's a good one. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=946.88s)]
*  You know, it was fascinating, too, because it's a big Sinead fan. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=950.12s)]
*  And I actually didn't go to my high school 10 year reunion because Sinead O'Connor was playing at the Hard Rock. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=955.52s)]
*  I went to see Sinead O'Connor instead and then to meet her and go through this whole thing with Connor. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=962.1600000000001s)]
*  And she was such an incredible performer and had such a great voice. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=969.6800000000001s)]
*  And I think this kind of goes to what you were talking about, about putting yourself out there. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=975.0s)]
*  You know, she ripped up that picture of the pope on Saturday Night Live that night. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=979.72s)]
*  And she got fucking just attacked by everybody. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=983.96s)]
*  I mean, everybody just started coming after her and she got beat on for so long [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=987.96s)]
*  that she actually got to the point where she would have terrible anxiety when she would go out and try to perform. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=993.8000000000001s)]
*  So leading up to that Connor walkout, it was we didn't know if it was going to happen or not happen live, [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=1001.72s)]
*  even though she was there and we had done the deal with her to come. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=1008.8s)]

*  I think it needs to be the commonplace. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=1128.1599999999999s)]

*  Oh, so he knows what's going on. [[01:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=3979.4s)]
*  So he's trying to bet. [[01:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=3982.08s)]
*  So he knows what's going on. [[01:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=3983.64s)]
*  So he lets these offshore guys know, yeah, this guy's going to fight. [[01:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=3986.12s)]
*  And he tore his ACL or did something like that. [[01:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=3989.88s)]
*  This happened. It did. [[01:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=3993.32s)]

*  And that's the closest thing to, you know. Right. [[01:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=3996.52s)]
*  But there's no more about insider information. [[01:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=4000.52s)]
*  I see. But these guys, the thing that's so fucking stupid is [[01:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=4002.6s)]
*  when you start, when money starts coming in on a guy, these guys know. [[01:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=4005.64s)]
*  They know, man, they they know the gambling world inside and out. [[01:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=4010.56s)]
*  So if anything's fishy, then they end up launching an investigation. [[01:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=4014.92s)]
*  Yeah. And they're going to get you. [[01:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=4017.92s)]
*  And guess what? [[01:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=4019.7599999999998s)]
*  Whatever you made on that bet is not fucking worth going to. [[01:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=4020.96s)]
*  You see me say this before it's out there. [[01:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=4025.52s)]
*  Federal fucking prison. [[01:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=4027.12s)]

*  You're going to fucking federal prison. [[01:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=4034.12s)]
*  Yeah. You can't people have people be like, what are you in for? [[01:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=4036.28s)]
*  You know, and you're like, Pala Costa in the third round. [[01:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=4039.16s)]
*  You know, like it would just be it wouldn't be as like, you know, [[01:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=4043.52s)]
*  and I love Pala Costa, that's no, it's not that. [[01:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=4046.92s)]
*  But it's like, you can't have that be what you're in for in a fucking serious. [[01:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=4048.68s)]
*  There's a big difference when you talk about certain crimes. [[01:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=4052.0s)]
*  But this one is a federal fucking crime because it's gambling. [[01:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=4054.64s)]
*  And you go to federal prison. [[01:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=4058.08s)]
*  That's that's some real shit. [[01:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=4060.12s)]

*  What about and just one more question. [[01:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=4065.16s)]
*  So but does that happen to sports where they get compromised? [[01:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=4066.96s)]
*  Do you think like, does that make any sense when I'm trying? [[01:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=4070.7599999999998s)]
*  And I'm not saying that I don't know. [[01:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=4072.92s)]
*  I mean, it's a great question. [[01:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=4074.44s)]
*  It's something that how many people have ever said to you, oh, my God, [[01:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=4075.8399999999997s)]

*  The Patriots just beat the bills. Right. [[01:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=4083.44s)]
*  And the bills are ten and a half point favorites. [[01:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=4085.2s)]
*  You know, it's stuff like that that makes people go crazy. [[01:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=4087.08s)]
*  Detroit just got killed. [[01:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=4089.56s)]
*  You know, one of the best there, five and one or five and oh, [[01:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=4091.48s)]
*  I don't know what they were. [[01:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=4094.36s)]
*  But it's just all that type of shit is what made me stop. [[01:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=4095.04s)]
*  You know, you know, I'm a fucking gambler. [[01:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=4099.64s)]

*  I do not sports. Oh, was there a bet that took you out of it or just that kind of stuff? [[01:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=4104.0s)]
*  You know, people say, I threw a little money on the game for fun. [[01:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=4108.28s)]
*  There's nothing fucking fun about betting on a game. [[01:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=4111.36s)]
*  It is the biggest sweat roller coaster of all fucking time, man. [[01:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=4113.64s)]
*  And it won't be fun or make you happy. [[01:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=4117.2s)]

*  And, you know, you get in there and it's just more fun. [[01:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=4126.92s)]
*  I'm actually hands on and actually playing the fucking game. [[01:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=4133.08s)]
*  You know, when you sit there and just watch a fucking game [[01:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=4136.759999999999s)]
*  and watch this whole thing unfold and and lose your money. [[01:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=4139.44s)]
*  There's absolutely nothing fun about it. [[01:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=4142.639999999999s)]
*  Or these guys that will do these parlays. Yeah. [[01:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=4143.96s)]
*  I got an 18 parlay and every fucking team wins. [[01:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=4146.2s)]
*  And then you lose the last the last fucking game on the parlay. Right. Yeah. [[01:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=4149.16s)]
*  And you bet $10 it would have paid you $10 million if you fucking won. [[01:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=4152.88s)]
*  And now you spent two days watching it to now your kids are eating fucking coffee. [[01:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=4156.2s)]
*  Yeah, that shit is fucking. [[01:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=4161.84s)]
*  Dude, what about like, was there a fighter that retired [[01:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=4163.84s)]
*  and it just kind of broke your heart because you just or and it could be more than one. [[01:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=4168.48s)]
*  Maybe I mean, I know you have probably have a great relationship [[01:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=4172.5599999999995s)]
*  and unique relationships with all of them. [[01:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=4175.12s)]
*  But was there one that like. [[01:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=4178.0s)]
*  Is it hard not to get attached to some of them? [[01:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=4180.36s)]
*  100 percent, especially in the early days, we were like a big family. [[01:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=4182.56s)]
*  I mean, it was like everybody knew everybody. [[01:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=4186.8s)]
*  I mean, when you go back to when you go back to Chuck Liddell, [[01:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=4189.4s)]
*  Matt Hughes, Rich Franklin, you know, I mean, that whole group back then. [[01:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=4192.76s)]
*  I mean, these people would come to my house for Christmas and Thanksgiving [[01:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=4197.16s)]
*  and, you know, holidays and things like that. [[01:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=4200.44s)]
*  And then you had to go up there and watch them fight. [[01:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=4202.96s)]
*  And it was tough. [[01:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=4204.8s)]
*  And Rhonda Rousey, Rhonda and I are super close. [[01:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=4206.08s)]
*  And that was a tough one. [[01:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=4209.8s)]
*  I would say the toughest retirement for me, [[01:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=4213.04s)]
*  because usually when it's time for them to retire, I'm happy for them to retire. [[01:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=4215.88s)]
*  It's it's over. [[01:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=4219.08s)]
*  You've accomplished everything that you could possibly accomplish. [[01:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=4220.36s)]
*  Why keep doing this? [[01:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=4223.12s)]
*  Habib was a tough retirement. [[01:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=4225.32s)]
*  Yeah. You know, because I think Habib had so much more to offer [[01:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=4227.04s)]
*  and so much much more to accomplish. [[01:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=4230.5199999999995s)]
*  But I think when his dad passed away, [[01:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=4232.88s)]
*  it kind of sucked the the fun out of it for him. [[01:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=4235.04s)]
*  And he was done. [[01:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=4237.92s)]
*  Plus, he made so much fucking money, he never has to do anything ever again. [[01:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=4239.64s)]
*  Oh, yeah, he could buy his own rock quarry over there. [[01:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=4243.64s)]
*  You know, and no offense, I don't know where they're at, [[01:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=4246.24s)]
*  but I know it gets pretty, you know, you know, [[01:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=4247.92s)]
*  paleolithic in some of those areas. [[01:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=4251.16s)]
*  I don't know if you have anything else to talk about, man. [[01:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=4254.56s)]
*  Yeah, one thing you said that kind of reminded me was I remember when when [[01:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=4256.84s)]
*  Trump was running for office and Bill Belichick, that guy, you know, [[01:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=4259.56s)]
*  Belichick, they asked him about him and he said, that's my friend. [[01:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=4262.24s)]
*  I support my fucking friend. [[01:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=4264.44s)]
*  You know, like whatever you guys think about it is fine. [[01:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=4265.719999999999s)]
*  Like because he wrote a letter to him telling him congratulations for running. [[01:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=4268.36s)]
*  I think was that is that what happened? [[01:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=4271.719999999999s)]
*  And what are you talking about? [[01:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=4273.5199999999995s)]
*  It was when Donald Trump was running for office, right. [[01:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=4275.639999999999s)]
*  And they and Bill Belichick had written him a letter that just said, [[01:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=4277.679999999999s)]
*  hey, congrats on running for president. [[01:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=4281.08s)]
*  Right. And I think Trump mentioned it. [[01:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=4283.4s)]
*  And then the media attacked Belichick about it. [[01:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=4285.5199999999995s)]
*  But he said, hey, that's my friend. [[01:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=4288.32s)]
*  Right. I support my friend. [[01:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=4291.0s)]
*  Yeah. And it's yeah. [[01:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=4292.84s)]
*  And people need to be able to stand up. [[01:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=4294.28s)]
*  I think it's yeah, I think people, a lot of people are in fear because. [[01:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=4295.4800000000005s)]
*  I'm having breakfast with him tomorrow on his plane. [[01:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=4299.16s)]
*  He's my friend. Right. [[01:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=4301.32s)]
*  Oh, yeah. All the time we talk about fights. [[01:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=4302.56s)]
*  So he called me up right after Abu Dhabi and said, those rights are great. [[01:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=4304.68s)]
*  Oh, my God. The bulk, you know. [[01:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=4308.84s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah, I met him twice at your events, man. [[01:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=4310.88s)]
*  Exactly. And it was great. [[01:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=4314.0s)]
*  He's a great guy. He's you know, it was this is the politics are dirty, man. [[01:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=4315.16s)]

*  right with him right now, if he wasn't running, it wouldn't be doing any of this. [[01:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=4324.2s)]
*  None of this would be happening. [[01:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=4327.88s)]
*  And if he wasn't in the lead, like he's going to win the election, [[01:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=4329.08s)]
*  none of this would be happening to him right now. [[01:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=4331.88s)]
*  So, yeah, it's just it is what it is. [[01:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=4333.52s)]
*  And the guy's always been an amazing friend to me. [[01:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=4335.4s)]
*  You know, I will be friends for the rest of our lives. [[01:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWvLRcc_R4M&t=4339.2s)]
