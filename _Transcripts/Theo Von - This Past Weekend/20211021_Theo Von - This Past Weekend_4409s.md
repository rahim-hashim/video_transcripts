*  That I think it's hard to hide from your ego [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kbcE3lJ8AA&t=1303.84s)]

*  Gay or money gays they call them and [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kbcE3lJ8AA&t=1408.6s)]

*  But [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kbcE3lJ8AA&t=1473.16s)]
*  But then he'll jump, you know next thing, you know, he's at the jewelry store. He's at a Tyler the Creator concert and [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kbcE3lJ8AA&t=1475.0400000000002s)]

*  You know, I date women at all ages anywhere from probably [[00:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kbcE3lJ8AA&t=3517.5s)]
*  You know 40 to probably 25 [[00:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kbcE3lJ8AA&t=3523.86s)]
*  so some of you did a younger lady makes you feel a little bit younger, but [[00:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kbcE3lJ8AA&t=3527.86s)]
*  I'll stay young. I'll play hoops with the you know, younger generations and stuff like that [[00:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kbcE3lJ8AA&t=3532.7s)]
*  You know, I'll listen to future. I'll do different shit [[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kbcE3lJ8AA&t=3538.2999999999997s)]
*  I'm a nylon boy [[00:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kbcE3lJ8AA&t=3542.02s)]
*  I'll listen to those frickin little pineapple wig is right there dude Jeepers. Come on. What is that? [[00:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kbcE3lJ8AA&t=3544.98s)]
*  But yeah, it's there's something about it that stings man is that it's that the fact that you don't know [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kbcE3lJ8AA&t=3556.46s)]
*  You know the fact that you get but I you know, I [[00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kbcE3lJ8AA&t=3568.78s)]
*  I [[00:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kbcE3lJ8AA&t=3572.78s)]
*  Think get it. I think you want to make sure you get to do the things you can do while you're here [[00:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kbcE3lJ8AA&t=3573.98s)]
*  That's what I think is probably a bigger fear [[00:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kbcE3lJ8AA&t=3579.94s)]
*  That you get to love someone [[00:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kbcE3lJ8AA&t=3585.0200000000004s)]
*  That you get to apologize to somebody that you get to forgive someone [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kbcE3lJ8AA&t=3588.34s)]
*  That you get to take responsibility that you get to maybe see your child [[00:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kbcE3lJ8AA&t=3594.82s)]
*  That you get to hug them or hold them that you get to [[01:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kbcE3lJ8AA&t=3602.6600000000003s)]
*  That you get to let somebody know how much they mean to you [[01:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kbcE3lJ8AA&t=3609.3s)]
*  That you get to have real real real human experiences [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kbcE3lJ8AA&t=3614.26s)]
*  That those moments where when you're met when your mouth wants to say something [[01:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kbcE3lJ8AA&t=3619.46s)]
*  You don't say something that you that you override those things [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kbcE3lJ8AA&t=3622.86s)]
*  That you really push the pedal on [[01:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kbcE3lJ8AA&t=3626.5s)]
*  On this experience of being human that's that's one way to defeat some of that aging feeling I think I [[01:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kbcE3lJ8AA&t=3629.1s)]
*  Think people used to feel like this was all there was in the existence realm [[01:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kbcE3lJ8AA&t=3640.3s)]
*  Now thanks to I [[01:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kbcE3lJ8AA&t=3647.18s)]
*  Think just our own imaginations thanks to times changing [[01:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kbcE3lJ8AA&t=3652.26s)]
*  Less ghosts, I think people are moving on and doing different things after they die. There's debt. There's other experiences [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kbcE3lJ8AA&t=3658.94s)]
*  And so I think people are more curious about those [[01:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kbcE3lJ8AA&t=3665.94s)]
*  Especially if we're living in a society where maybe people aren't always making the most out of all of the frickin [[01:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kbcE3lJ8AA&t=3669.86s)]
*  You know out of all the stuff we got [[01:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kbcE3lJ8AA&t=3675.7000000000003s)]
*  But and I don't mean to sound that in a dad in like a dour way, but I started noticing for myself [[01:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kbcE3lJ8AA&t=3680.02s)]
*  Well, I want to feel different I want to have different feelings why I need to have a different environment [[01:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kbcE3lJ8AA&t=3685.58s)]
*  I need to adjust what it is and that means I need to have a family. I need to love someone I need to [[01:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kbcE3lJ8AA&t=3689.42s)]
*  Be brave enough to do these things that are gonna make me feel alive and that I think color about color balances the aging [[01:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kbcE3lJ8AA&t=3696.1s)]
*  Because yeah, it's a little spooky getting older man and [[01:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kbcE3lJ8AA&t=3705.74s)]
*  Fighting to stay young is that oh, that's the worst [[01:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kbcE3lJ8AA&t=3709.1s)]
*  dude, I went on a date with a gal and I [[01:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kbcE3lJ8AA&t=3712.34s)]
*  Showed she's what music were playing in the car and I gave her my phone. So she is like give I music [[01:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kbcE3lJ8AA&t=3715.46s)]
*  She's like, what are you like 60? And I was I just felt so embarrassed. I should have done Spotify [[01:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kbcE3lJ8AA&t=3722.74s)]
*  So just little things like that you're afraid to talk about movies like oh have you seen this movie [[01:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kbcE3lJ8AA&t=3730.58s)]
*  have you seen land before time 2 and you just see your dates face just disappear and [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kbcE3lJ8AA&t=3736.06s)]
*  It just like just things like that like like trying to stay young is very hard [[01:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kbcE3lJ8AA&t=3743.98s)]
*  It's also kind of fun though [[01:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kbcE3lJ8AA&t=3751.3s)]
*  Trying to stay young [[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kbcE3lJ8AA&t=3754.9s)]
*  But we're all chasing that moment of just [[01:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kbcE3lJ8AA&t=3758.86s)]
*  When time was being older wasn't even a thing there was no older [[01:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kbcE3lJ8AA&t=3763.14s)]
*  You were so just [[01:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kbcE3lJ8AA&t=3768.26s)]
*  All systems go man everything was just like maybe ten years old [[01:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kbcE3lJ8AA&t=3771.26s)]
*  When you thought about being across the room and you were across the room [[01:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kbcE3lJ8AA&t=3777.3s)]
*  Where you lie your friends would make you live just like everything was so free when you have to worry about there was no [[01:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kbcE3lJ8AA&t=3783.46s)]
*  Concerns no worries [[01:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kbcE3lJ8AA&t=3789.1400000000003s)]
*  Hmm [[01:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kbcE3lJ8AA&t=3792.1400000000003s)]
*  So to be that way again no matter what age you are that is such a search I think [[01:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kbcE3lJ8AA&t=3794.94s)]
*  To be that free [[01:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kbcE3lJ8AA&t=3800.98s)]
*  That age doesn't even [[01:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kbcE3lJ8AA&t=3804.98s)]
*  You don't even let it count you anymore [[01:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kbcE3lJ8AA&t=3809.46s)]
*  Because you such a G dog [[01:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kbcE3lJ8AA&t=3813.5400000000004s)]
*  Because you such a damn Bruce Lee of life [[01:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kbcE3lJ8AA&t=3818.0200000000004s)]
*  Now when age comes to count you or cake you up one year you say hey fam you could do it, but [[01:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kbcE3lJ8AA&t=3821.46s)]
*  You know I'm bigger than that [[01:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kbcE3lJ8AA&t=3827.34s)]
*  You know I'm doing something that you can't calculate [[01:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kbcE3lJ8AA&t=3831.26s)]
*  And living in that kind of joy, I think there's a lot of value in that and this but how do you get there? [[01:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kbcE3lJ8AA&t=3836.54s)]
*  I don't know [[01:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kbcE3lJ8AA&t=3841.1400000000003s)]
*  But that's one of the true journeys of life [[01:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kbcE3lJ8AA&t=3843.1400000000003s)]
*  That's why I always pains me when people die young that they don't get to try and see how things work and get to have [[01:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kbcE3lJ8AA&t=3844.82s)]
*  The most out of this experience [[01:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kbcE3lJ8AA&t=3850.6600000000003s)]
*  But I don't know thank you for that question man anything all right, let's take one more call here [[01:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kbcE3lJ8AA&t=3853.22s)]
