*  These are the ones I do it to where it's a total safe place and maybe I should just stay there [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1c87uDjdrA&t=330.5s)]
*  Cigurra, Bill Burr, Rogan, Ari, Joey even with Joey got to be a little careful because [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1c87uDjdrA&t=334.38s)]
*  Joe because Joey's not the most technologically all over the map guy, right? [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1c87uDjdrA&t=339.46s)]
*  He just hears word of mouth though Burt was shitting on you. He'll call you immediately. Yeah, but like Joe man [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1c87uDjdrA&t=343.9s)]
*  We fuck with Joe hearty shit on that sober October thing. Yeah. Oh, yeah when he was doing I remember he came in [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1c87uDjdrA&t=349.54s)]
*  He came in the county so once he seemed kind of like upset. I was like what's going on? [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1c87uDjdrA&t=357.18s)]
*  He's like I've had to do yoga for 30 days [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1c87uDjdrA&t=360.98s)]
*  Dude, let me tell you let me tell you something about fucking Rogan and by the way [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1c87uDjdrA&t=363.44s)]
*  Well, just because of these internet goddamn trolls. I love Joe Rogan [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1c87uDjdrA&t=367.98s)]
*  He's one of my closest friends, but man when he when we started doing that hope so October thing [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1c87uDjdrA&t=371.58000000000004s)]
*  This is how it went down. Okay, it was all about me [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1c87uDjdrA&t=375.88s)]
*  everyone's gonna do it but then Ari and Tom said they'd be into it and [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1c87uDjdrA&t=378.66s)]
*  And we thought it was a thing a collective with Joe [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1c87uDjdrA&t=381.56s)]
*  So I cut this video and in the video it's me running through the forest and I go this sober October [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1c87uDjdrA&t=384.36s)]
*  So October me and my friends to titty Tom [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1c87uDjdrA&t=389.56s)]
*  Ari the welch Shafir and Joe and powerful Joe Rogan will all be going sober [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1c87uDjdrA&t=392.48s)]
*  I send it to Joe before I post it and I go hey just making sure everyone's cool with this Joe didn't reply right [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1c87uDjdrA&t=396.92s)]
*  And so we're like he took that as a yeah [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1c87uDjdrA&t=401.72s)]
*  No, so Sager and Tom and I were like Sager and Ari and I were like wait with no reply from Joe [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1c87uDjdrA&t=403.88s)]
*  And then Ari's like wait Joe's doing it right? So he sends a text and Joe's like no fuck you guys [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1c87uDjdrA&t=408.44s)]
*  I don't have a problem. You guys fucking suck. You guys are doing it [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1c87uDjdrA&t=413.40000000000003s)]
*  And then Ari's then Ari mounts a fucking attack campaign [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1c87uDjdrA&t=416.6s)]
*  And he texts us independently he goes yo, I'm taking down Joe you are with me now Sager is such a fucking cuck [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1c87uDjdrA&t=419.68s)]
*  Even when we fucking write Ari's like I'm gonna post a video [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1c87uDjdrA&t=426.24s)]
*  I want your comments to be the first two comments on Instagram and I know we're gonna workshop them [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1c87uDjdrA&t=430.08s)]
*  So they're aggressive enough that Joe has to reply right? So I write mine [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1c87uDjdrA&t=434.64s)]
*  I guess I really don't have a problem. Joe's got the problem. He can't give up marijuana. Whatever I said, you know [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1c87uDjdrA&t=438.96000000000004s)]
*  He needs it to eat his dinner [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1c87uDjdrA&t=444.44s)]
*  If you need marijuana eat your dinner, you've got a problem and then Sager writes his and Sager is such a fucking bitch [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1c87uDjdrA&t=446.44s)]

*  Do you think we'll ever get to that kind of a racial stuff again? I don't think that we will I feel like we're I feel [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1c87uDjdrA&t=2151.92s)]
*  Like we're going up on a race war right now [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1c87uDjdrA&t=2156.92s)]
*  You do the way things are going shaking down like I followed the maybe the wrong people on Instagram [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1c87uDjdrA&t=2158.48s)]
*  But like it seems like like I'll tell you I'll tell you the race war that is happening [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1c87uDjdrA&t=2163.66s)]
*  And if you don't know that then you're not paying attention close enough [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1c87uDjdrA&t=2168.34s)]
*  Feminism has a race war inside it inside of it. You do there. There's this [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1c87uDjdrA&t=2172.48s)]
*  I just read an article yesterday how saying the white feminists are the new Nazis [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1c87uDjdrA&t=2176.8s)]
*  Really? Yeah, because white feminism [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1c87uDjdrA&t=2182.2000000000003s)]
*  Doesn't I get from what this article said this isn't me but white feminism is is [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1c87uDjdrA&t=2185.88s)]
*  Does not account for the struggles of the of the women of color [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1c87uDjdrA&t=2193.2000000000003s)]
*  They only account for their own struggle Lena Dunham. I guess is the perfect example in this article. They said this [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1c87uDjdrA&t=2198.0s)]
*  I don't I'm not but she went after Odell Beckham Jr. For not flirting with her and all the black feminists were like [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1c87uDjdrA&t=2203.76s)]
*  Oh, I'm sorry because he's a black man. He's got a flirt with you. He can't be there to work [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1c87uDjdrA&t=2209.82s)]
*  you just look at him as a piece of meat and and and [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1c87uDjdrA&t=2213.52s)]
*  Lena Dunham was like [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1c87uDjdrA&t=2216.88s)]
*  Amy sadly our friend Amy is in that group that people do she got so much fucking trouble for [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1c87uDjdrA&t=2218.88s)]
*  She's really like that sometimes I wonder or is she I think it's a business thing [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1c87uDjdrA&t=2225.22s)]
*  Oh, I don't think she's a bad person [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1c87uDjdrA&t=2230.88s)]
*  But I start to wonder once you get into that level of making money and that level like how much of you just becomes a business [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1c87uDjdrA&t=2232.48s)]
*  Okay, she okay she got in trouble for doing Beyonce's [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1c87uDjdrA&t=2240.16s)]
*  Lemonade video on the set of snatched. She got in a lot of trouble. They're like cultural appropriation now [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1c87uDjdrA&t=2244.2799999999997s)]
*  I am some of that shit is fucking ridiculous. Some of that stuff to me is fucking ridiculous like [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1c87uDjdrA&t=2250.04s)]
*  At a certain point, it's like if we're all supposed to mix [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1c87uDjdrA&t=2255.16s)]
*  It's like things are gonna get appropriate like if you want to talk about some of the things that are like they've been the latest [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1c87uDjdrA&t=2258.56s)]
*  like hypothetical slave owners a lot of it has been [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1c87uDjdrA&t=2263.0s)]
*  People owning the rights of performers like and across all all ethnicities, you know [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1c87uDjdrA&t=2267.2s)]
*  And like I don't fucking know man. So this shit makes me mad, bro [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1c87uDjdrA&t=2273.46s)]
*  I mean I've done you probably get on because you are fucking unattractive to a lot of men [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1c87uDjdrA&t=2276.9399999999996s)]
*  Well, the fact is a little Odell Beckham jr. Can fuck a lot of decent looking women everything. Yeah [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1c87uDjdrA&t=2281.74s)]
*  He's got his he gets she gets [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1c87uDjdrA&t=2288.48s)]
*  Any Davido looks fucking better than Lena Dunham I think or they're pretty much the same I would fuck I [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1c87uDjdrA&t=2291.78s)]
*  Would probably fuck him first cuz he had curly or hair, you know [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1c87uDjdrA&t=2297.08s)]
*  She just seems like a like like I want to I do want to have sex with a woman because they have a vagina [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1c87uDjdrA&t=2300.8s)]
*  But I don't want just a fucking good reason. That's a good reason [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1c87uDjdrA&t=2306.66s)]
*  But I don't want that person to be just a complete cunt and that's what Lena Dunham seems like to me [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1c87uDjdrA&t=2309.9s)]
*  I see we couldn't find the vagina because she's just a cunt [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1c87uDjdrA&t=2314.58s)]
*  I think she's just a business person and she doesn't care really about women all that feminine to her [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1c87uDjdrA&t=2317.26s)]
*  But at a certain point when things become a business, I don't think it can just be about what your cause is anymore [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1c87uDjdrA&t=2322.1800000000003s)]
*  Well, that's what I worry about. I think what happens is I'll defend Amy [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1c87uDjdrA&t=2327.42s)]
*  in this statement, but she gets so big that I think there she has a [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1c87uDjdrA&t=2332.5400000000004s)]
*  Responsibility to say certain things for young ladies who look up to her, right? [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1c87uDjdrA&t=2338.0200000000004s)]
*  She can't just fucking be like we are right now talking shit [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1c87uDjdrA&t=2342.0600000000004s)]
*  And so I think she you know [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1c87uDjdrA&t=2345.02s)]
*  But also celebrities get to this point and I think that that's the thing that makes a lot of celebrities [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1c87uDjdrA&t=2347.02s)]
*  Unattractive these days is because that they're they're not real anymore. There's there's no nuance to it [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1c87uDjdrA&t=2351.22s)]
*  It's like you say something and then whatever you said is taken into context and you're like no no no [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1c87uDjdrA&t=2355.62s)]
*  Taking out of context you're like no take it in context. I was fucking around. We're two comics. We're bullshitting [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1c87uDjdrA&t=2360.1s)]
*  Yeah, like this isn't like I like I didn't mean it, you know [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1c87uDjdrA&t=2364.74s)]
*  But I guess people just want that soundbite and they want to clickbait shit [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1c87uDjdrA&t=2368.1s)]
*  But I think that most of America thinks that that it doesn't rely on that anymore [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1c87uDjdrA&t=2371.8199999999997s)]
*  I think that's why you even see like with the election a lot of people were like [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1c87uDjdrA&t=2375.54s)]
*  I don't think that half of America is racist assholes that want to build a wall at all [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1c87uDjdrA&t=2378.3399999999997s)]
*  No, I think most people are like I don't believe I hate the government and I'll put at least I know this guy's a fuck [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1c87uDjdrA&t=2383.98s)]
*  I know who Donald Trump is. He's a fucking Mulan crook probably [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1c87uDjdrA&t=2392.06s)]
*  Yeah, just like every other fucking old white guy in my town [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1c87uDjdrA&t=2396.02s)]
*  It's all put him in all of them pieces shit. Sorry. I didn't get heated bro. No, I agree with you man [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1c87uDjdrA&t=2399.2599999999998s)]
*  I think if you look and you go like like when Chris Hardwick got in trouble and they were like, it's it's gone viral [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1c87uDjdrA&t=2404.86s)]
*  He would they need to fire him. I looked online. It was 5,000 people tweeting about it [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1c87uDjdrA&t=2411.18s)]
*  5,000 people. Yeah, 5,000 people that was all job is to tweet about shit all day and not do anything anything [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1c87uDjdrA&t=2415.74s)]
*  And do you think my dad knew about it? No, no, do you think any of his friends knew about it? Nope [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1c87uDjdrA&t=2421.86s)]

*  What really fucking blew my mind is I was in I was when I was there when I found out I was in Birmingham [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1c87uDjdrA&t=2427.46s)]

*  I said, oh shit Chris Hardwick and he goes, oh, I love that guy and I go I [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1c87uDjdrA&t=2445.8799999999997s)]

*  He goes I don't give a fuck what happened. I just like his show [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1c87uDjdrA&t=2459.46s)]
*  Yeah, that's the majority of America is like man. I'm not gonna read it like now look for the Harvey Weinstein's [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1c87uDjdrA&t=2461.46s)]
*  Yeah, the time for them to lose your job [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1c87uDjdrA&t=2467.1800000000003s)]
*  But the nuance of like the things with hardwick you're like no, it's not going viral. The whole world doesn't know about it [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1c87uDjdrA&t=2468.7000000000003s)]
*  It's like Bill Burrow you say I remember he got in trouble one time [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1c87uDjdrA&t=2474.88s)]

*  My question is [[01:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1c87uDjdrA&t=5378.66s)]
*  When he takes his shirt off on stage [[01:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1c87uDjdrA&t=5380.42s)]
*  Is that his signature trademark like ronnie dangersfield? I have no respect [[01:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1c87uDjdrA&t=5383.38s)]
*  Because when I see him at the comedy store on the regular [[01:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1c87uDjdrA&t=5388.0199999999995s)]
*  It seems like as soon as that shirt comes off [[01:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1c87uDjdrA&t=5391.46s)]
*  The energy level in the crowd his energy level goes from like zero to 100 real [[01:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1c87uDjdrA&t=5394.34s)]
*  Accurate [[01:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1c87uDjdrA&t=5401.0599999999995s)]
*  Do you think it does something? It's like, um, it's so funny. We're talking about running running danger field. Yeah, ronnie king. He called him [[01:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1c87uDjdrA&t=5402.58s)]
*  The caller called him ronnie danger fields though, that's true any danger field. He also called him burke kreisler. Yeah [[01:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1c87uDjdrA&t=5411.0599999999995s)]
*  This dude obviously doesn't use all the vowels. Uh, yeah with the second I take my shirt off [[01:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1c87uDjdrA&t=5419.38s)]
*  I started taking my shirt off because I was I get on the road and I just get depressed [[01:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1c87uDjdrA&t=5423.3s)]
*  Yeah, but if I took my shirt off, it made me giggle. I just thought it was ridiculous [[01:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1c87uDjdrA&t=5426.5s)]
*  See that 100% [[01:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1c87uDjdrA&t=5429.54s)]

*  And then I started doing it all the time. Just take it off and leave it and it was like it was like just funny [[01:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1c87uDjdrA&t=5434.58s)]
*  And people were like I remember people in the front row being like I can't believe your shirt's still off [[01:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1c87uDjdrA&t=5438.34s)]
*  And I'd be like, yeah, I know right and then at the store sometimes I swear to god if I I [[01:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1c87uDjdrA&t=5442.18s)]
*  Won't I usually don't take my shirt off in the or I won't take my shirt off in the belly room [[01:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1c87uDjdrA&t=5447.22s)]
*  But in the main room if it's a big show and it's sold out [[01:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1c87uDjdrA&t=5451.3s)]
*  I do feel like there are people that travel from around the world to come to the store to see their favorite comics [[01:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1c87uDjdrA&t=5453.620000000001s)]
*  And if I happen to be one of the ones they wanted to see they definitely want to see me with my shirt off [[01:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1c87uDjdrA&t=5458.900000000001s)]

*  Right, and I think that makes me have more fun on stage. Do you feel like it is but [[01:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1c87uDjdrA&t=5492.0199999999995s)]
