*  Yeah, yeah, you can. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrR4SBvL0Ck&t=241.68s)]
*  But then I get, yeah, sometimes the wheels start to fall off. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrR4SBvL0Ck&t=243.68s)]
*  I agree. I'm actually very similar. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrR4SBvL0Ck&t=245.68s)]
*  If I'm like, alright, this is fun, I'm having a good day, sometimes I'll just. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrR4SBvL0Ck&t=247.68s)]

*  Doing it with a buddy is so fun, dude, because you have like, there's just somebody to talk to. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrR4SBvL0Ck&t=253.68s)]
*  Like, sometimes I'll do them by myself and I'm like, fuck, I wish there was somebody else here, you know. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrR4SBvL0Ck&t=255.68s)]
*  I'm doing them by yourselves. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrR4SBvL0Ck&t=259.68s)]
*  Crazy. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrR4SBvL0Ck&t=261.68s)]
*  That's so crazy. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrR4SBvL0Ck&t=263.68s)]
*  I can't imagine. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrR4SBvL0Ck&t=265.68s)]
*  How often do you do that? [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrR4SBvL0Ck&t=267.68s)]
*  It really is. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrR4SBvL0Ck&t=269.68s)]
*  I think I do it like once a month right now by myself. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrR4SBvL0Ck&t=271.68s)]
*  It's gotta be hard. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrR4SBvL0Ck&t=273.68s)]
*  Yeah, I think it's, let me think about what it's like. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrR4SBvL0Ck&t=275.68s)]
*  I think sometimes it's just tough because you're own, if you have a bad attitude, it's just you. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrR4SBvL0Ck&t=277.68s)]
*  I can't imagine, yeah. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrR4SBvL0Ck&t=279.68s)]
*  If I felt bad, I would go on there and. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrR4SBvL0Ck&t=281.68s)]
*  Just be like, hey, I feel bad. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrR4SBvL0Ck&t=283.68s)]
*  But then you don't want to be every week like, hey, I feel like shit. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrR4SBvL0Ck&t=285.68s)]
*  I know. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrR4SBvL0Ck&t=287.68s)]
*  I've been in several months of that. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrR4SBvL0Ck&t=289.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrR4SBvL0Ck&t=291.68s)]
*  Every episode I'm like, fucking hungover again. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrR4SBvL0Ck&t=293.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrR4SBvL0Ck&t=295.68s)]
*  God damn it, this is depressing. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrR4SBvL0Ck&t=297.68s)]
*  Really? It makes you feel that? [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrR4SBvL0Ck&t=299.68s)]
*  Like every time you show up, you're like, oh, I'm hungover until you start to notice a pattern, you mean? [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrR4SBvL0Ck&t=301.68s)]
*  Oh, yeah, for sure. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrR4SBvL0Ck&t=303.68s)]
*  Drinking too much, that's a very bad habit. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrR4SBvL0Ck&t=305.68s)]
*  I'm like, I'm not a drinker. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrR4SBvL0Ck&t=307.68s)]
*  I'm drinking too much, that's a bit, but I love it. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrR4SBvL0Ck&t=309.68s)]
*  I love it. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrR4SBvL0Ck&t=311.68s)]
*  There's no part of me that's like, alright, stop. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrR4SBvL0Ck&t=313.68s)]
*  It's just like, no, you got it. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrR4SBvL0Ck&t=315.68s)]
*  That's what you tell yourself. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrR4SBvL0Ck&t=317.68s)]
*  You got, no, you're fully in control. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrR4SBvL0Ck&t=319.68s)]
*  No, man. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrR4SBvL0Ck&t=321.68s)]
*  You're completely in control. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrR4SBvL0Ck&t=323.68s)]
*  Dude, one time we were drinking with my buddy. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrR4SBvL0Ck&t=325.68s)]
*  And he got into the Uber ride and he just didn't get his, like, he had like real kind of heavy legs. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrR4SBvL0Ck&t=327.68s)]
*  Because his mom kind of had heavy legs. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrR4SBvL0Ck&t=331.68s)]
*  But she'll wear tight pants. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrR4SBvL0Ck&t=333.68s)]
*  And you kind of couldn't tell, but if you were over there a lot, you knew that she kind of had really stocky legs. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrR4SBvL0Ck&t=335.68s)]
*  But he was bringing his second leg into the Uber and his sandal fell off, right? [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrR4SBvL0Ck&t=337.68s)]
*  So then we had this place we were going and probably fucking shows off. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrR4SBvL0Ck&t=339.68s)]
*  Yeah, everybody was just like, he just seemed so much drunker than he was. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrR4SBvL0Ck&t=341.68s)]
*  It's crazy how losing, yeah. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrR4SBvL0Ck&t=343.68s)]
*  We're losing one piece of footwear and somebody's like, oh, that guy's. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrR4SBvL0Ck&t=345.68s)]
*  A lens of a glasses, one lens. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrR4SBvL0Ck&t=347.68s)]
*  Yeah, I know. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrR4SBvL0Ck&t=349.68s)]

*  Then you got Rogan in there. Okay, you got his team of security [[01:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrR4SBvL0Ck&t=4633.04s)]

*  So I think you're gonna have for sure [[01:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrR4SBvL0Ck&t=4667.02s)]

*  Now the tough part is to keep your army excited you are gonna need [[01:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrR4SBvL0Ck&t=4696.58s)]
*  Over-the-counter meds probably [[01:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrR4SBvL0Ck&t=4702.22s)]
*  Or under the counter, I don't know which one it is. I think I think they're getting over [[01:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrR4SBvL0Ck&t=4704.900000000001s)]
*  Okay, I think over-the-counter led them there, but it's crazy that the people who are [[01:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrR4SBvL0Ck&t=4708.700000000001s)]

*  No, I think look that'd be a tough one to get in that's what I'm saying there's a lot of security [[01:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrR4SBvL0Ck&t=4723.3s)]
*  Oh, that's a good point. That's what I'm saying. It's a good first round. You know what I mean week one [[01:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrR4SBvL0Ck&t=4727.14s)]

*  Do you feel like we could really end up in our lifetime as heading to a revolution or some sort of a [[01:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrR4SBvL0Ck&t=4758.42s)]
*  Like a place where this where people where it all topples over you know because all it takes is really I've thought about this [[01:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrR4SBvL0Ck&t=4764.46s)]
*  all it takes is a police like a [[01:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrR4SBvL0Ck&t=4770.7s)]
*  Couple of people like at a police like police stations all it takes a couple people to be like hey [[01:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrR4SBvL0Ck&t=4772.86s)]
*  I'm not gonna follow the rules anymore [[01:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrR4SBvL0Ck&t=4778.16s)]

*  feel like kind of people just kind of [[01:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrR4SBvL0Ck&t=4787.2s)]
*  Or like if nobody's gonna follow the rules and why do everybody's kind of getting there? It feels like sometimes maybe I'm wrong [[01:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrR4SBvL0Ck&t=4789.679999999999s)]
*  You know maybe I'm just making exciting for the conversation. I don't know yeah, I don't know how wrong you are [[01:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrR4SBvL0Ck&t=4796.84s)]

*  I don't know if that's gonna start a revolution, but [[01:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrR4SBvL0Ck&t=4805.32s)]
*  But at a certain point if enough people say okay, I'm not gonna drive within the lines right yeah [[01:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrR4SBvL0Ck&t=4808.4400000000005s)]

*  Usually you know but if enough people are like well fuck it. I'm not waiting cuz there's a there's an emergent [[01:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrR4SBvL0Ck&t=4821.72s)]

*  Yeah, I've been thinking about that [[01:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrR4SBvL0Ck&t=4871.24s)]

*  You know and I like and they go to the big cities and stuff like that [[01:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrR4SBvL0Ck&t=4879.08s)]

*  Well I've been thinking about getting building like a halfway house or something like that. That'd be nice [[01:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrR4SBvL0Ck&t=4900.4s)]
*  Yeah, it'd be pretty cool. Yeah, and then those people could be [[01:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrR4SBvL0Ck&t=4904.639999999999s)]
