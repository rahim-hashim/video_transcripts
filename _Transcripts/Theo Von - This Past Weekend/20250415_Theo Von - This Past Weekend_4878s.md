Video Description: Lane Kiffin is heading into his fifth season as Head Football Coach at the University of Mississippi. He has led the Rebels to four consecutive bowl berths, including two New Year’s Six appearances, under his guidance since 2020.

Theo joins Coach Kiffin in his office in Oxford, MS to talk about his somewhat polarizing reputation in the world of college football, how much SEC football means to people, and secrets from his legendary coaches group chat.

*  Yeah, my daughter's actually a Pilates teacher, but yoga is like better, [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=51.4s)]

*  Yeah, the intensity like make it so so miserable. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=56.8s)]

*  I control the heat in the back. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=61.4s)]
*  You do? Yeah. At the yoga studio. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=62.6s)]
*  Yeah. Oh, that's great, man. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=64.4s)]
*  Yeah. Does it remind you almost of game day out there on the field? [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=65.6s)]
*  Like is it gets pretty I mean, you're in the SEC. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=68.3s)]

*  So I make it that way too. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=74.1s)]
*  Like that we're playing like in the swamp or in Baton Rouge, [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=75.7s)]
*  like in our early September games. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=79.0s)]
*  So it's like really hot. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=81.4s)]
*  So you're like fight through it. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=82.5s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. Baton Ratchet, dude. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=83.8s)]
*  That's what I call it. Yeah. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=85.89999999999999s)]
*  I was trying to go this morning. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=86.89999999999999s)]
*  So then like you would have gone through the misery and experience [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=88.2s)]
*  and then we'd like discuss it on air. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=91.3s)]
*  So you'd be like, man, I did get my yoga in this morning, though. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=92.8s)]
*  Yeah. A little slower. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=95.7s)]
*  A little different. Yeah. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=96.7s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. I got it in that room temp. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=97.7s)]
*  This isn't like traditional yoga like flow, which that's good. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=100.19999999999999s)]
*  That's actually where I started with it. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=104.6s)]
*  Then I was like, I got to go to another level, like make this put a heater in there, [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=106.0s)]
*  like make it as hot intense and then like put cardio in there. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=109.9s)]
*  And I just like bringing new people to it and they struggle. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=113.7s)]
*  So it makes me feel good about myself. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=116.2s)]
*  Oh, yeah. That's part of it. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=117.5s)]
*  That's a oh, yeah. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=119.0s)]
*  That was me. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=120.3s)]
*  This is a couple hours ago getting it done on my cat Williams statue right there. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=120.8s)]
*  I didn't know what that was like Nutcracker or something. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=124.2s)]
*  Oh, yeah. That's a that's a statue of cat Williams that they have. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=126.60000000000001s)]
*  But yes. Is that a big part of your like is yoga like a regular part of your day usually or your week? [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=129.0s)]
*  Yeah. Every day every morning. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=133.6s)]
*  It like starts my day that way. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=135.9s)]
*  And so there's no phone for an hour, you know, [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=137.7s)]
*  and you got to like you got to get uncomfortable. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=141.2s)]
*  You got to sit in it. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=145.1s)]
*  So I fear if I can start my day, use it like six o'clock in the morning that way and be so uncomfortable. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=146.1s)]
*  That's the hardest part of my day. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=151.79999999999998s)]
*  The rest of it, man, I can deal with the rest. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=153.29999999999998s)]
*  Yeah. And so that, you know, you just you get in those poses too in those positions. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=155.2s)]
*  You're just like, man, this is I want to get out of this discomfort. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=160.0s)]
*  I got to stay in the discomfort. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=163.7s)]
*  And over time, just I'm able to stay in it longer and longer and more intense with the heat. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=166.0s)]
*  And I feel like the rest of the day, man, just kind of like chill for the rest of the day. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=170.8s)]
*  And what so the heat's been ramped up. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=174.70000000000002s)]
*  What's the next thing you think you would add in to to laying kiffin like the laying kiffin yoga experience, [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=176.70000000000002s)]
*  which almost seems like people should wear pads to be added. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=182.8s)]
*  It's yeah. Yeah. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=185.8s)]
*  Well, we have playlists. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=187.20000000000002s)]
*  So we got good music, good energetic music. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=188.20000000000002s)]
*  We put some cardio in there now. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=190.5s)]
*  And so we challenge the teachers like come up with the hardest things possible. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=192.5s)]
*  So they just like make this list of stuff like, you know, back when you were like young and you were like training in high school [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=195.5s)]
*  and they just put up all the all the different like three by ten, three by fifteen, like all these and keep going. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=200.7s)]
*  And then like some of the classes like are public. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=206.6s)]
*  So we got students in there. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=209.89999999999998s)]
*  We got other people in there. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=211.0s)]
*  So and then we like I feel like civilians. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=212.0s)]
*  I'm trying I'm trying to take Oxford to another level. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=214.7s)]
*  So I'm like, I want for generations it to be tough. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=217.29999999999998s)]
*  Yeah. And so sometimes they're like, well, open the door. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=220.0s)]
*  You know, I'm like, don't open the door, man. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=222.39999999999998s)]
*  We like keep them in the heat. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=224.0s)]
*  Yeah. Hold the line. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=225.5s)]
*  Yes. And then at the end, like I'm like, guess what? [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=226.5s)]
*  We need overtime. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=229.0s)]
*  Like last week, it's March Madness. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=230.5s)]
*  We need an overtime. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=232.1s)]
*  And everybody's like, no, no, overtime, no overtime coach. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=233.0s)]
*  And I'm like, kick the field goal coach. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=236.3s)]
*  We got to get out of here. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=237.8s)]
*  We're making these kids tougher. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=238.7s)]
*  Dang. I can't believe the fact that somebody is trying to start generational yoga is that's next level, man. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=240.1s)]
*  I guess that's the Lane Kiffin level, you know, and I like the fact you hit me up on social media. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=247.7s)]
*  I thought that was cool just to like kind of welcome me into the area today. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=252.1s)]
*  So I thought that was pretty cool. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=255.0s)]
*  You kind of have like a notorious, you're kind of notorious on Twitter for like being like a unique, like kind of an outspoken coach. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=256.70000000000005s)]
*  Would you say that's a fair term? [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=264.6s)]
*  Yeah, I would say very different. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=266.70000000000005s)]
*  Yeah, I looked at social media when I started was for recruiting because we weren't able to text. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=268.1s)]
*  It gives a dumb NCAA rule like most of them and you couldn't text him. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=274.1s)]
*  Could you mail? [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=278.3s)]
*  Yeah, you could. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=279.0s)]
*  You could DM him. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=280.3s)]
*  You could on Twitter. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=281.0s)]
*  You can message him. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=283.1s)]
*  You can message him on Twitter, but you couldn't text them person. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=284.1s)]
*  Yes, made no sense. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=286.2s)]
*  Right. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=287.59999999999997s)]
*  So that's why it was started and then I just kind of started being a normal person. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=288.09999999999997s)]
*  I was like, you know, I can't be a normal person as a coach in a lot of my life. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=293.4s)]
*  So I was like on social media. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=297.5s)]
*  I'll just be normal and then buddy start sending me stuff. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=298.8s)]
*  I just retweet it or other coaches like in the SEC like Kirby smart. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=301.59999999999997s)]
*  He all the time because he's politically correct. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=305.5s)]
*  So he's like got stuff he wants to put out there, but he's like they just send it to me because they know I will so nice. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=307.2s)]
*  I just kind of embraced it and ran on it. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=313.59999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, I think it's I think it separates you from some of the other guys out there. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=315.4s)]
*  That's for sure. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=319.29999999999995s)]
*  I think yeah, it makes you seem a little bit more kind of crazy and personable at the same time. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=319.79999999999995s)]
*  I think the reason why I kept going with it was because I would go into home visits and these parents would say or they'd come into my office like when they're doing a campus tour and they would say to me like coach. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=326.0s)]
*  We feel like we already know you. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=340.4s)]
*  We love your social media. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=341.5s)]

*  I love your Instagram. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=344.20000000000005s)]
*  Like we feel like we already know you and I'm like well shoot. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=344.90000000000003s)]
*  How much is that worth that? [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=347.90000000000003s)]
*  They're already coming to visit us wanting their kid to go here saying we already know you because of it. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=349.40000000000003s)]
*  So then I just kept going with it. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=354.0s)]
*  Yeah, I mean look you're the only you're the only college coach that we wanted to meet up with. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=356.3s)]
*  So this is kind of worked out. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=360.8s)]
*  Yeah, I think it probably does have an effect. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=362.6s)]
*  You know, I've made it. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=364.3s)]
*  I feel like I've made it then. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=365.5s)]
*  Well, now this college coach that Theo von wants to do a show with. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=367.20000000000005s)]
*  You don't lose your job. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=371.7s)]
*  I just thought this is over then. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=372.8s)]
*  That's the that's the goal. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=374.0s)]
*  That's the goal. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=375.0s)]
*  Yeah to keep you five more minutes. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=375.6s)]
*  Yeah, 55 more minutes. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=377.1s)]
*  That's the goal. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=378.2s)]
*  Is there a difference between the kind of the Twitter Lane and and I'm the one saying putting you in a third person. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=379.40000000000003s)]
*  I know you're not doing that. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=386.6s)]
*  So but is there a difference between the kind of the Twitter personality and the personality of the actual personality like what's kind of like offline Lane? [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=387.6s)]
*  I would say the Twitter is probably closer to it. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=396.7s)]
*  You know people that are around me all the time and stuff say like what was out there early on especially about me or what people think really isn't what he is. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=401.09999999999997s)]
*  And you probably hear that a lot. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=411.59999999999997s)]
*  But yeah, so I feel like Twitter is more actually how I am just kind of okay. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=412.59999999999997s)]
*  That's funny. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=416.4s)]
*  I also like say that or send that out, you know, like and so I'm not an old school coach in many regards at all. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=416.9s)]
*  Just because I think you should always evolve. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=425.5s)]
*  You should always not do things because it was in a book of how to do it before and always kind of test things, you know, like around here. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=427.9s)]
*  We say, you know, instead of just thinking outside the box, we create a new box. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=434.5s)]
*  We challenge everything different ways of thinking things. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=438.7s)]
*  So and social media is part of that because that's not or how I do a press conference or even doing this probably some coaches that even if they if you did call them up for this, they wouldn't do it because they'd say, okay, well, that's not really the message. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=441.5s)]
*  I want to put out, you know, yeah, Kim Mulkey won't text me back. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=455.1s)]
*  I mean, that should be like a no brainer. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=460.5s)]
*  That's what I'm thinking in state. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=463.0s)]
*  I mean, you got to have amazing like Louisiana following positive numbers. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=464.5s)]
*  I don't know how they track that, but it's got to be amazing. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=470.20000000000005s)]
*  I mean, you're one of them. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=472.90000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, I'm not the Flau'jae Johnson levels yet. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=473.8s)]
*  I'll get there though, I think. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=476.40000000000003s)]
*  So why do you think like because yeah, you do have a unique personality, right? [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=478.0s)]
*  And you at least your personality is able to be seen these days. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=481.6s)]
*  And I think that that's something that just happens more over time with social media and more just we have more video of people in general now, you know, so there's just like so many more little moments that get captures. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=484.2s)]
*  You get to know somebody's personality. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=495.2s)]
*  And that's how I think a lot of fans, they I think they gravitate a lot more towards athletes, coaches, anybody really in the world because they get to know their personality. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=497.2s)]
*  Right. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=507.09999999999997s)]
*  We were talking before about social media and how that kind of like like why people kind of gravitate towards certain people on social media. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=508.3s)]
*  And I think some of that's that's just kind of the answer is just there's more out there. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=514.6s)]
*  And if people are willing to show some of their personality and not kind of follow like this playbook of exactly how things are supposed to be, but remain within HR. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=517.9s)]
*  HR has a box. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=528.3s)]
*  You have to stay in pretty much. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=529.2s)]
*  Yeah, but I think I don't know if I don't make any sense as a head coach. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=530.3s)]
*  You got a lot of people that you've got to please. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=536.1s)]
*  Right. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=538.8s)]
*  And that's challenging in these type of settings, these things, because you want to talk to recruits and that age group, your current players, your fans. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=539.1s)]
*  But then you also have administration. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=548.5s)]
*  You've got old donors that have been around a long time, seen things done a certain way for a long time. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=550.6s)]
*  So there's a lot of challenges in that. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=556.0s)]
*  And you can't you can't please everybody, which you know, so I've kind of. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=559.1s)]
*  Right or wrong. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=566.0s)]
*  I've always said, hey, my job is to wherever I'm working at, meaning my job is to Ole Miss. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=566.7s)]
*  And not to potential future presidents or ADs at other places or other fan bases. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=573.5s)]
*  And so whether I was at Tennessee or USC or here, wherever I was, it was like, okay. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=580.6s)]
*  A lot of what I say other fans don't like maybe even other athletic directors like, well, I don't like that. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=587.0s)]
*  He said that. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=593.5s)]
*  But our own fans, our own administration really like it because it's usually me backing Ole Miss and saying what I think about the program, what it should be. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=594.7s)]
*  And maybe sometimes taking shots at other programs or something like that factual information blatantly, you know, and putting it out there. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=603.0s)]
*  And so that that upsets some people and upsets a lot of other fan bases. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=611.8s)]
*  Well, that's not my job to worry about them. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=617.2s)]
*  Yes. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=619.5s)]
*  Yeah, you have one fan base. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=620.1s)]
*  Yeah, they they're not they didn't hire me. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=621.2s)]
*  They're not paying the bills. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=623.2s)]
*  So I've always looked at and I think a lot of coaches don't do that. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=624.1s)]
*  And I'm not saying I'm right. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=628.0s)]
*  A lot of coaches say, hey, I'm going to say things so that future employers potential that they see it so that they're going to want to hire me. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=629.6s)]
*  And I've just never thought that way. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=638.0s)]
*  Do you you already had two experiences like coaching in the SEC, right? [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=640.0s)]
*  At Alabama and at Tennessee. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=646.4000000000001s)]
*  Yep. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=650.1s)]
*  Like how's it been different here at Ole Miss? [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=651.1s)]
*  Because I mean, you know, some people call it the Yale of Mississippi kind of. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=652.9s)]
*  Well, I think, you know, I was, as you mentioned, head coach of Tennessee, then office coordinator at Alabama. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=657.8s)]
*  So spent some time there and those programs really over a long period of time had won a lot of games. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=663.9s)]
*  Alabama, unbelievable championship runs, coach Saban, probably a you know, a decade there that's never going to be done. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=673.6999999999999s)]
*  Ever again. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=680.4s)]
*  Yeah, too many wins, I think for a school not good for them at a certain point, but. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=681.3s)]
*  We're not not good for competitive environment throughout the conference when he was taking all the players and winning all the games now. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=685.8s)]
*  And Ole Miss had been down, right? [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=693.3s)]
*  You know, somebody said a stat the other day, you know, in the last four years. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=695.1999999999999s)]
*  So the seniors in college here, it's been a cool experience for them. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=699.8s)]
*  They saw a national championship in baseball. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=703.3s)]
*  They just saw both basketball teams go to the sweet 16. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=705.5s)]
*  And in four years of football here, we've had three top 12 finishes. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=708.3000000000001s)]
*  Well, they only had one in the previous 51 years. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=712.5s)]
*  Wow. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=715.1s)]
*  So there's been four and 55 years. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=715.8000000000001s)]
*  They've seen three of the four. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=717.4000000000001s)]
*  So the difference obviously in the programs was different, but I really liked that. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=718.6s)]
*  It was like a challenge because you can come in at the top of a place. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=723.4000000000001s)]
*  It's kind of always one and then you win. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=726.9000000000001s)]
*  It's like, okay versus wow, let's like change what's happened. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=728.8000000000001s)]
*  Let's like create a new winning culture, a new way of thinking in how the locker [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=733.3000000000001s)]
*  room and the whole university thinks about football and the program. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=738.9000000000001s)]
*  And so we've raised the expectations to where we won 10 games and people are upset around here. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=742.9000000000001s)]
*  You know, right. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=749.7s)]
*  And so that's a different energy. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=750.6s)]
*  You guys were 13 points away from 13 more points and you guys are undefeated last year 13 total. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=752.5s)]
*  Well, you need three to win. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=758.9000000000001s)]
*  So 16 more points last year and you guys would have been undefeated. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=760.2s)]
*  Yeah, pretty crazy. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=762.9s)]
*  Yeah, we played 13 games 10 of them. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=763.9s)]
*  We won by double digits and then the three losses were all one score games right at the end of the game. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=766.1999999999999s)]
*  What's what's kind of different between coaching like in the pack 10 or I think it's the pack 12 or something. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=772.0999999999999s)]
*  Now everybody keeps kind of like changing their names, but I don't think it exists anymore. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=776.6999999999999s)]
*  It's like pack two now. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=780.0s)]
*  Yeah, pack. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=781.1999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, it was like it was eight at one point and once 10 and it was 12 and some of those teams should not have been in there. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=781.5999999999999s)]
*  And now there's like two. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=788.1999999999999s)]
*  Everybody else left. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=789.5s)]
*  What was it like? [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=790.4s)]
*  What do you notice different between coaching and like the pack like a different conference as opposed to the SEC? [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=790.9s)]
*  Like you coached at FAU you coached at you coached in the pack 10 to 12 8, you know, what's the difference you think? [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=794.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=803.8s)]
*  You know, there's a saying like in the SEC day coin, like it just means more. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=806.9s)]
*  And it really does like the passion in the towns for the football programs. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=811.5s)]
*  The attention on it and really the play overtime has been dominant. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=818.4s)]
*  The SEC's had more draft picks, more championships, all those things. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=825.1s)]
*  It's just different. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=828.8s)]
*  It's a way of life down here. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=830.0s)]
*  And yeah, and people that can't even read and they can but they're just yelling go dogs. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=832.0s)]
*  I feel if somebody come out of a coma and be like go dogs or something, you know, yeah, somebody like come out of a coma and be like honey, honey, and then just pass away like people's last words. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=837.5s)]
*  Baby's first word. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=845.6s)]
*  Just like 30 videos of baby's first words being like SEC chance or whatever. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=846.6s)]
*  It's a lot. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=851.5s)]
*  I was the head coach at USC. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=852.3s)]
*  You spend time out in LA. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=854.4s)]
*  So it's just a different world out there. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=855.5s)]
*  And I remember I was walking through campus and I was like, yeah, I bet like 50 70% of these students have no idea who I'm the head coach of the football team. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=857.4s)]
*  They got no idea who I am. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=869.2s)]
*  They just they're going to school at USC, you know, getting their education. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=870.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=873.6s)]
*  And like here that like like 100% know who you are, you know, like the little kids like the you know, you go to like walk downtown and like a four year olds like coach Kiffin like they know who you are. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=875.9s)]
*  So it's like they'll complain about your people that haven't been down here. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=890.6s)]
*  Maybe that makes sense to them like to understand that. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=895.2s)]
*  Yeah, like you don't go anywhere without any everybody knowing who you are. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=897.8s)]
*  But also like that too, you know, right. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=902.1s)]
*  It'll be like, yeah, yeah, they're like eight year old kid. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=904.5s)]
*  Maybe not for they just go to hell. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=906.6s)]
*  But eight year old. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=908.8s)]
*  Well, we've been winning. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=909.7s)]
*  They don't say that. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=911.0s)]
*  But that will happen as soon as we lose a couple. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=911.7s)]
*  Yeah, but no, they do. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=913.6s)]
*  They'll be like, coach, man, like, what about throwing that tight end on the in route? [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=915.5s)]
*  I'm like, you're like eight. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=921.0s)]
*  I mean, how do you how do you know that? [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=922.4s)]
*  I was 11 and what are you doing at this cafe? [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=923.9s)]
*  You should be in school. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=926.2s)]
*  You should easily obviously you're true. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=927.1s)]
*  But yeah, it's definitely it's a lot more intense in the South. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=930.1s)]
*  It's just it's. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=932.5s)]
*  Yeah, they're like, like coach, you're three for 14 on third downs. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=933.9s)]
*  I'm like, I don't even know that. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=937.1s)]
*  Yeah, I do. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=938.6s)]
*  But it's just it just means more the passion for and it's also why it's so awesome, too. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=939.6999999999999s)]
*  It's why the stadiums are the way that they are. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=943.9s)]
*  The electricity before games as people walk into the stadiums like it's just different. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=946.3s)]
*  I love that. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=951.3s)]
*  Yeah, because you guys have a walk. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=952.5s)]
*  I mean, I think a couple of teams do a walk now. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=953.6999999999999s)]
*  Do people ever try and tickle you or whatever you walk by? [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=956.8s)]
*  That's crazy. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=958.8s)]
*  That's something. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=959.4s)]
*  Well, I like moved. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=960.5s)]
*  I this happened at Tennessee and then here. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=962.0s)]
*  And maybe this isn't like the best thing, but I like moved it a little wider. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=965.0999999999999s)]
*  Like they didn't have like barricades on the walk and they're like, well, it's great, man. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=969.5s)]
*  The fans are like you interact with them on this walk is like a half mile. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=974.1999999999999s)]
*  Like you're walking through like 40,000 people. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=978.6999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, you know, and like, you know, wear a suit and everything. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=980.5999999999999s)]
*  And then like they're like grabbing you and everything. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=983.4s)]
*  And so I moved the barricades a little adults. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=985.6999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, like a little wider. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=989.5s)]
*  Plus, I mean, we are in the deep south. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=990.8s)]
*  So there's a lot of great things. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=992.6s)]
*  But I mean, there's just some different things too. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=994.8s)]
*  Now, you know, they're like grabbing you and I got to spit on her hand. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=996.5s)]
*  And stuff like, you know, like the man people just yelling stuff. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=999.8s)]
*  Like, yeah, there's a lot of it's like, whoa, can we like move these just back a little bit? [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=1002.6s)]
*  Maybe like, maybe I can just do the wave. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=1005.9s)]
*  Yeah, you know, hey guys, good to see you put the defensive tackles along the outside. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=1007.5s)]
*  Yeah, I agree with you guys. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=1013.1s)]
*  Yeah, it's definitely a ton of tradition here. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=1014.3s)]
*  I mean, this is like Morgan Freeman's front porch down here in the south. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=1016.1999999999999s)]
*  It's a slower lifestyle. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=1019.2s)]
*  Was that a little bit tough for you? [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=1020.5s)]
*  I mean, what's I mean, it is Mississippi is the it's a it is like wandering back through time. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=1022.4s)]
*  You know, yeah, there's a lot there. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=1028.6s)]
*  Yeah, an impact there. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=1031.9s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, it's a lot of I moved here. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=1034.8s)]
*  A lot of tradition and everything you're giving me is just full disclosure. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=1037.5s)]
*  Anyway, I moved here because it was the SEC head job and I thought we could win and do a great job. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=1040.3s)]
*  It wasn't I wasn't like, man, I want to move to like I'm just really dying to move to Oxford, Mississippi. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=1046.1999999999998s)]
*  Right. But I also didn't know much about it either. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=1051.8999999999999s)]
*  So I judged it that way. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=1054.6999999999998s)]
*  Just kind of like a lot of people do about Mississippi. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=1055.8999999999999s)]
*  And at first it was a lot because because I'd spent most my time before that in South Florida or in LA at USC. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=1060.6999999999998s)]
*  And I was like, at first I was like, whoo, this is a lot like, [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=1070.1999999999998s)]
*  I mean, long winded, like a lot of conversations, slow moving. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=1073.9s)]
*  Oh, yeah. But then you say thank you. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=1079.9s)]
*  Like it's not over. Right. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=1082.2s)]
*  Hey, thank you. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=1083.9s)]
*  And then like they just keep going. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=1085.3000000000002s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=1086.8000000000002s)]
*  I'm like, no, but no, really. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=1087.6000000000001s)]
*  Thank you. I really appreciate it. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=1088.6000000000001s)]
*  Like I'm going to go to go now. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=1090.0s)]
*  Oh, well, what are you so what are you doing tomorrow? [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=1091.6000000000001s)]
*  I just met you like, you know, like, oh, yeah, you can make everybody's a friend. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=1097.0s)]
*  And there's also so many famous authors of that. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=1101.3999999999999s)]
*  That's why the South is so full of famous storytellers because everybody is one, you know. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=1105.1s)]
*  But then it took me some I'm so glad that I've been here long enough now, five years going on six year. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=1110.3999999999999s)]
*  And now I see it completely different. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=1116.6s)]
*  Now I go back to like South Florida or I go to LA and I'm like, dang, these people are rude. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=1119.2s)]
*  Like everybody's moving fast. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=1124.3999999999999s)]
*  Everybody's just into themselves. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=1125.8999999999999s)]
*  Nobody's like saying hi. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=1127.1s)]
*  So it's like what I thought really was kind of bad. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=1128.3s)]
*  Now I'm like, man, I love it now. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=1132.4s)]
*  You know, it's like a warmth, a sweetness, you know, hospitality and people being nice. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=1134.8s)]
*  And I've and I've learned to that's actually slowed me down because I was always like, what job can I get? [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=1140.9s)]
*  You know, how fast can I move? [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=1147.9s)]
*  How many championships to win? [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=1150.7s)]
*  Like just always moving. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=1152.0s)]
*  And I was like, maybe they're onto something here. [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=1153.9s)]
*  Maybe this slowdown thing that I was judging at first, like I made jokes about the rocking chairs and people sitting rocking chairs. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=1156.1s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=1162.1s)]
*  And I'm like, first, Charlotte Airport or whatever. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=1162.7s)]
*  I saw that. [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=1165.6s)]
*  Yeah, I did when I was and I was like, you'll see somebody has a 40 second layover. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=1166.4s)]
*  They're like, I'm going to get a little rest in. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=1170.1s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=1171.9s)]
*  And I'm like, I actually saw some right away and people were in them. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=1172.2s)]
*  And I said to some of them, like, what are they doing? [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=1175.2s)]
*  It looks miserable. [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=1178.3s)]
*  Like that's so slow. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=1179.4s)]
*  And there's just two of them. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=1181.7s)]
*  Sometimes one. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=1183.6s)]
*  What are you doing? [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=1185.2s)]
*  Well, they don't even have their phone out. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=1186.2s)]
*  Like, yeah. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=1187.6000000000001s)]
*  And now I'm like, hey, they're onto something. [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=1189.3000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, just slow down. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=1191.8000000000002s)]
*  And so I've kind of said, hey, maybe there's something to the Mississippi lane. [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=1194.1000000000001s)]
*  I just slow down taking conversations, listen to people instead of just always talking and moving. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=1197.8000000000002s)]
*  And and now I love it. [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=1205.3000000000002s)]
*  It's definitely like the program is it feels a lot different. [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=1208.0s)]
*  You know, my best friend has been in hiding for years. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=1211.7s)]
*  He's an Ole Miss fanatic. [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=1214.3s)]
*  He will sit there and you know, he's betting on test scores. [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=1216.1s)]
*  He's betting on all types of stuff. [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=1219.3s)]
*  He's betting on SAT over unders for, you know, foreign exchange students. [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=1220.5s)]

*  the players in locker room and you come in and they just embrace everything and [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=1314.5s)]
*  then you start winning and they're just so excited because they're not used to [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=1318.3000000000002s)]
*  it. [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=1321.7s)]

*  locker rooms. [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=1326.3000000000002s)]

*  places on top and they're just winning and there's winning again, that's just [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=1332.7s)]
*  they just expect it. [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=1335.9s)]
*  And so they're not as appreciative of those moments because they haven't had it [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=1336.9s)]
*  taken away. [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=1340.0s)]

*  because her husband would be in a good mood [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2146.5s)]
*  and now they got, she's got to hold it another week. [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2147.7400000000002s)]
*  That's the toughest part. [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2150.78s)]
*  Like, hey, we cannot have, we lost this week. [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2152.1s)]
*  Yeah. We ain't having a baby under these circumstances. [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2154.18s)]
*  You keep it in there. [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2156.14s)]
*  Yeah. Hold the line. [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2156.98s)]
*  We got Bama next week. [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2158.98s)]
*  We win that, you can have it Saturday night. [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2159.98s)]
*  Yeah. We'll get that thing out. [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2162.06s)]
*  We'll do the tush push. [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2165.02s)]
*  That'll help. [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2166.18s)]
*  What's one of the most aggravating traditions [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2168.1s)]
*  that you think and what's one of the best traditions [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2169.66s)]
*  you think in college football? [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2171.5s)]
*  If you're even up on them. [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2174.06s)]
*  I know there's a chunk of them out there. [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2175.02s)]
*  Well, this is like a big tradition, [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2177.34s)]
*  like as far as everywhere, not specific places. [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2178.94s)]
*  Like I love the band thing, you know, before, [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2180.94s)]
*  like it's just really cool when they have the band out there [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2183.62s)]
*  and they spell things. [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2186.26s)]
*  Speaking of the Tennessee, the opening of the tee [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2187.7s)]
*  and then run out, like that was really cool to like see you. [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2189.7s)]
*  You're like right there and then like the band [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2193.5s)]
*  just opens up the tee and you run out. [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2195.22s)]
*  Like that's a really cool tradition. [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2197.34s)]
*  And is there one that's kind of aggravating [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2201.02s)]
*  that you see at a place somewhere? [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2202.86s)]
*  It could be SEC or anywhere. [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2204.06s)]
*  The fan storming thing is a little bit tough. [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2208.54s)]
*  You know, like they don't do it in the NFL. [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2211.02s)]
*  They found a way, like I get it, it's pretty cool. [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2214.34s)]
*  But then it can be aggravating [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2219.38s)]
*  because like they're storming and like, [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2220.78s)]
*  and you're worried about like, I'm hitting you, [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2223.42s)]
*  what's going on, what are they gonna do? [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2225.1800000000003s)]
*  It's like very, very invasive at that point. [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2226.42s)]
*  But I think like if they could just let everybody out [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2230.6200000000003s)]
*  and then let the fans on so they still get to [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2235.26s)]
*  tear the goalpost down, because that's cool and stuff. [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2237.34s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, I was at that old, [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2239.46s)]
*  at the Alabama Vanderbilt game and that was pretty sick. [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2241.34s)]
*  And some guy on the sidelines squeezed me so hard, [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2244.1000000000004s)]
*  bruised one of my ribs really bad or dislocated it, right? [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2247.2200000000003s)]
*  So I was like, eee, eee, eee, eee, eee, [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2249.62s)]
*  doing like that or whatever. [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2252.2999999999997s)]
*  And then every other player kept hugging me. [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2253.7s)]
*  So it was just one after another, [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2256.54s)]
*  just the biggest guys you ever even seen just hugging you. [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2259.86s)]
*  Yeah, they're all excited. [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2262.98s)]
*  Yeah, and it was just, oh dude, [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2264.1s)]
*  that was a really tough day. [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2266.54s)]
*  It was a tough year actually. [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2267.62s)]
*  That took about eight weeks to get better from. [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2269.1s)]
*  Yeah, but you were at a historic like moment. [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2271.14s)]
*  It was so cool. [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2273.2999999999997s)]
*  That will probably never happen ever again. [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2274.2999999999997s)]
*  I don't know, I wanna see. [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2276.1s)]
*  It was a once in a lifetime. [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2277.5s)]
*  Well, Diego Pabllo got that six year, [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2278.78s)]
*  that eighth year I think he got. [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2280.46s)]
*  Yeah, you never know. [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2281.86s)]
*  Were you surprised when he got that? [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2283.6200000000003s)]
*  Did it affect any of the way that, [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2284.82s)]
*  were your players able to apply for anything like that? [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2286.34s)]
*  We tried, we didn't win it. [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2288.98s)]
*  Jaxsodar actually tried to get another year [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2290.82s)]
*  or at least see if the option was there [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2293.42s)]
*  and they denied it, but. [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2294.94s)]
*  Yeah, there we are, we iced that dude up. [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2299.1800000000003s)]
*  Clark Lee. [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2302.02s)]
*  Good dude. [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2303.5s)]
*  I like, I love Clark. [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2304.34s)]
*  Yeah, old school good guy. [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2305.7000000000003s)]
*  They got a fun group over there. [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2307.6600000000003s)]
*  And that's kind of underdog energy over there too, you know? [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2309.54s)]
*  Good time. [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2311.02s)]
*  Is there an SEC team that you also cheer for [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2311.8599999999997s)]
*  on the low kind of? [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2313.54s)]
*  Them, I do. [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2315.22s)]
*  Yeah, Vanderbilt, [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2316.54s)]
*  cause I think they have like so much stacked against them, [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2317.5s)]
*  you know, like they got higher academic qualifications [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2319.74s)]
*  to get guys in so they can't just get all the players, [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2323.14s)]
*  everybody else can, you know, like harder, you know, [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2325.42s)]
*  because the stadium's usually half full and stuff. [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2328.7799999999997s)]
*  So I root for them, especially Clark, [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2330.7s)]
*  because that's a hard job. [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2333.62s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2335.1s)]
*  And so that's pretty cool for them to win. [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2335.94s)]
*  Like they did this year. [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2338.74s)]
*  Yeah, it's exciting over there. [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2339.58s)]
*  Yeah, they carried the goalpost [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2340.8199999999997s)]
*  and then they tried to valet park the goalpost. [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2341.9399999999996s)]
*  I heard they got tired of it or whatever. [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2344.2999999999997s)]
*  Didn't know that. [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2345.9399999999996s)]
*  And they tried to valet them at a restaurant. [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2346.7799999999997s)]
*  I'm like, you can't, [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2348.06s)]
*  who are you gonna give it to those three guys up front [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2348.8999999999996s)]
*  or whatever, like that's crazy. [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2350.8199999999997s)]
*  Yeah, but that might be the only like SEC town [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2352.14s)]
*  that has valet. [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2354.02s)]
*  That's a good, that's a. [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2355.02s)]
*  Like when you say that, that doesn't feel, [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2356.22s)]
*  they don't valet in most of these towns, valet. [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2357.66s)]
*  That's a great point. [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2359.9399999999996s)]
*  They didn't spell valet. [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2361.5s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2362.5s)]
*  Yeah, they tried to valet them at a, [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2363.3399999999997s)]
*  I think at a McCormick and Schmicks [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2365.7s)]
*  or something over there. [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2368.2599999999998s)]
*  So definitely kind of interesting. [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2369.22s)]
*  I wanna talk about Coach Saban. [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2372.3399999999997s)]
*  You worked with Coach Saban for a while. [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2374.1s)]
*  And you guys have had like kind of a storied history [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2375.94s)]

*  like he's got those old school things that aren't changing. [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2408.66s)]
*  And then I like got a text like two years ago [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2411.58s)]

*  Like this isn't supposed to happen. [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2424.42s)]

*  And then Kirby's like, yeah, I got one under this year too. [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2427.82s)]
*  Like he's like learned how to text, [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2432.1400000000003s)]
*  just like you get one or two words. [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2433.98s)]
*  But that relationship's like almost in a way [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2437.3s)]
*  kind of like how you can struggle sometimes, [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2441.0600000000004s)]
*  like maybe when you're in it with like a parent, [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2443.0200000000004s)]
*  and then you get out, like you get older, [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2445.3s)]
*  and you get away, you get out of the house. [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2447.38s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2449.0600000000004s)]
*  And then you're like, dang, man, he was onto something. [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2449.9s)]
*  He was right on those things. [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2452.6600000000003s)]
*  So I look back, I was there for three years, [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2455.02s)]
*  and there was friction initially. [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2457.02s)]
*  And I look back, there's all my, I'm the assistant. [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2459.02s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2461.46s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2462.2999999999997s)]
*  Like he's the head coach, you know, whatever he says goes. [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2463.14s)]
*  Oh yeah, you're supposed to keep it classy over there. [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2465.3399999999997s)]
*  Yes, and that's not, his way is very like, [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2468.14s)]
*  this is the way, like there's not open discussions [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2472.22s)]
*  about it and stuff. [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2474.8599999999997s)]
*  And I was, I'd worked for Pete Carroll as assistant. [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2475.7s)]
*  So that's all I knew. [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2478.3799999999997s)]
*  And it's just totally different. [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2480.5s)]
*  So like you come in, you have an open conversation, [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2483.02s)]
*  and you're questioning the process. [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2484.82s)]
*  No, I just was asking, like, have you looked at this? [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2486.7s)]
*  You know, like, so I didn't really know [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2489.18s)]
*  how it worked right away. [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2491.38s)]
*  And so it took a little bit of time. [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2492.78s)]
*  Like he didn't want a lot of suggestions. [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2494.18s)]
*  No, no, no, no. [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2495.94s)]
*  It's not like the suggestion box, like, hey, let me pull this. [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2497.22s)]
*  Oh, here's a good idea. [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2499.34s)]
*  You know, like, so it was just something [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2500.7s)]
*  I wasn't used to that way. [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2504.62s)]
*  And so it took a little bit of time. [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2505.98s)]
*  But now that I look back, I'm like, okay, [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2508.02s)]
*  he was so strict on everything. [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2509.66s)]
*  He was kind of like in an apparent way, [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2513.42s)]
*  like with his team, with the players, [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2514.26s)]
*  the coaches, like nothing changed. [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2515.5800000000004s)]
*  We won national championship, [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2518.5800000000004s)]
*  and there was 730 staff meeting the next morning. [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2519.86s)]
*  I'm like, what are we meeting on at 730 the next morning? [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2521.7400000000002s)]
*  He's like, we're behind. [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2524.02s)]
*  You know, because we won the championship, [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2525.6600000000003s)]
*  everybody else was recruiting, and we're behind. [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2527.1400000000003s)]
*  And I was like, well, what are we doing? [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2528.86s)]
*  But now I look back and be like, [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2530.94s)]
*  that's why he is what he is. [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2532.5800000000004s)]
*  That's why he was so great. [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2533.86s)]
*  Because it was like the standard never changed [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2534.86s)]
*  no matter what. [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2537.78s)]
*  And then it took me some time to understand too. [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2539.82s)]
*  Like when we were winning and playing really well, [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2541.62s)]
*  and coaching really well, he was harder on you. [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2546.18s)]
*  Because he didn't want you to have relief syndrome. [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2549.2999999999997s)]
*  You know, like, oh man, we've made it. [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2551.42s)]
*  And I didn't really understand that. [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2553.42s)]
*  Would he call it that relief syndrome? [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2554.2599999999998s)]
*  I saw, he was on the pivot like a month ago, [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2555.7799999999997s)]
*  and I listened to it, my son Knox, [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2559.14s)]
*  and he talked about it in there. [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2560.9s)]
*  He'd never explained it to us, [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2562.54s)]
*  but it was interesting to hear. [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2565.54s)]
*  And he said, most people are born with a relief syndrome. [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2566.66s)]
*  He wasn't. [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2569.62s)]
*  He just always had this way of thinking like, [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2571.02s)]
*  hey, you never relax like, but most people are. [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2573.26s)]
*  So he went above and beyond [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2575.86s)]
*  to make sure people didn't have that. [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2578.22s)]
*  Like we'd win a game, [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2579.62s)]
*  and then he comes in and just like rips us. [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2581.34s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2583.62s)]
*  And we're like, man, we played great, like coach great. [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2584.46s)]
*  That was because he was guarding against that, [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2586.22s)]
*  because he knew that that could happen. [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2588.26s)]
*  Dang. Yeah. [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2589.82s)]
*  He wasn't letting anything be a possibility to lose. [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2592.42s)]
*  When I left, we'd won 26 straight games. [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2595.18s)]
*  So I only hadn't had many losses, [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2597.42s)]
*  but I do remember the three losses [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2600.46s)]
*  that we had over the three years. [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2602.7400000000002s)]
*  Like he actually, after those, was calm. [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2604.1s)]
*  Like that's when we didn't get ripped, [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2609.1s)]
*  because he's like, they're gonna get ripped anyway. [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2610.78s)]
*  I don't need to, you know? [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2614.94s)]
*  Like I need to, when they're feeling good about themselves, [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2616.98s)]
*  bring him down. [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2619.54s)]
*  So I didn't really understand that at first. [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2620.86s)]
*  And now I look back going, man, [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2623.34s)]
*  he was, there's a reason he's the greatest. [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2624.86s)]
*  Wow. [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2626.94s)]
*  Yeah, do you regard him as the greatest, yeah? [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2627.82s)]
*  I do. [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2629.42s)]
*  I think because, you know, to Bear Bryant, [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2631.1400000000003s)]
*  so like legends back then, no offense, [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2633.54s)]
*  they had like unlimited scholarships. [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2636.54s)]
*  Coach Saban did it in an era [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2639.1800000000003s)]
*  where there were reduced scholarship numbers. [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2640.46s)]
*  He also did an era when you're losing coaches [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2643.86s)]
*  left and right. [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2645.78s)]
*  You know, he lost so many assistant coaches [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2646.6200000000003s)]
*  and he just kept winning. [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2648.42s)]
*  And I don't think anybody will ever be able [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2650.1000000000004s)]
*  to do that again. [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2651.86s)]
*  And he couldn't even do that again, [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2653.2200000000003s)]
*  the way that it's going anyway. [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2656.2200000000003s)]
*  And now this, with the money part and all that stuff, [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2658.2599999999998s)]
*  that's like evening things out [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2660.98s)]
*  that people can't stack the teams like he did. [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2662.66s)]
*  Because now your second team and third teams, [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2666.9399999999996s)]
*  maybe before where they had to sit there and wait, [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2669.66s)]
*  they couldn't leave back then. [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2671.58s)]
*  Now they leave. [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2673.2999999999997s)]
*  So you lose your backups [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2674.2999999999997s)]
*  because someone gives them more money. [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2675.62s)]
*  But how was he able to convince players to sit there, [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2677.18s)]
*  be just as good and sit second or third position? [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2679.3799999999997s)]
*  That's tough, I feel like. [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2681.54s)]
*  Yeah, well, that's what I'm saying. [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2682.58s)]
*  Part of his time, they couldn't leave yet. [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2684.3799999999997s)]
*  You couldn't transfer. [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2687.5s)]
*  Now you can transfer twice a year. [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2688.8999999999996s)]
*  So he still was able at the end to convince some guys to stay, [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2691.18s)]
*  but he started losing back, so the teams weren't as deep. [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2694.02s)]
*  Did he have to recruit the whole time or at a certain point, [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2697.4199999999996s)]
*  did the acumen of their coach, of their winning, [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2699.3399999999997s)]
*  just to be the recruiter for him, do you think? [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2702.14s)]
*  That helped a lot, but he never changed. [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2704.62s)]
*  That was him. [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2706.74s)]
*  Like there was no relief. [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2707.74s)]
*  It never changed. [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2708.8199999999997s)]
*  Like he recruited every day, no matter what. [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2709.74s)]
*  And he was nonstop and he was relentless. [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2714.14s)]
*  People always say, okay, well, why did he win [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2715.94s)]
*  so many championships? [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2718.78s)]
*  Why was he so good? [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2719.6600000000003s)]
*  And then it's like, well, there's the process. [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2720.6600000000003s)]
*  There's the assistant coaches. [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2722.26s)]
*  There's the discipline, all these different areas. [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2723.7000000000003s)]
*  But really the number one thing that mattered the most, [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2727.78s)]
*  he out-recruited people. [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2730.82s)]
*  He got better players. [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2732.46s)]
*  When you get better players, you win a lot of games. [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2733.7000000000003s)]
*  And it wasn't just coming there just to come there. [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2735.7000000000003s)]
*  They came there because he recruited really hard. [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2738.06s)]
*  Got it. [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2740.1800000000003s)]
*  Did he, what was he like? [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2741.42s)]
*  I mean, did you ever get to spend any time with him? [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2742.38s)]
*  Like, was he good at cards or anything like that? [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2744.02s)]
*  Did he do anything else besides, [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2746.5s)]
*  like did he ever take his whistle off, you think? [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2748.8199999999997s)]
*  Like even in the shower, you know? [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2751.2999999999997s)]
*  Coach didn't do a lot of other things. [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2754.74s)]
*  I didn't know he golfed. [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2756.2599999999998s)]
*  I never golfed with him, but he golfed. [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2757.54s)]
*  Did he ever invite you, [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2760.3799999999997s)]
*  or did he ever dress up for Halloween? [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2761.22s)]
*  Like was there anything you ever saw Coach Saban do [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2762.8199999999997s)]
*  that was like, felt a little bit more, [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2764.7799999999997s)]
*  not as much like, who's that guy? [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2768.02s)]
*  Robert Downey Jr. [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2772.14s)]
*  What's the character he plays? [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2773.1s)]
*  Iron that was outside of Iron Man, you know? [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2774.62s)]
*  It's interesting, you know, Nick Saban, [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2778.14s)]
*  and people joke, Nick Satan, you know, [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2780.8599999999997s)]
*  he was born on Halloween. [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2782.54s)]
*  Was he really? [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2783.98s)]
*  It was his birthday every year, it was Halloween. [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2784.8199999999997s)]
*  No. Yeah. [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2786.38s)]
*  So maybe his whole frickin' existence was a costume. [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2787.54s)]
*  Maybe. [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2790.74s)]
*  But he did not, there was not, [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2792.66s)]
*  he wasn't gonna wear a costume or something like that [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2794.2999999999997s)]
*  on Halloween, so there was no like, [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2796.7s)]
*  how could he not have like Halloween parties and stuff? [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2798.42s)]
*  On your own birthday, [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2800.2999999999997s)]
*  even put on a little cat tail or something. [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2801.54s)]
*  Because it was, no day was different. [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2805.58s)]
*  Every day was the same. [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2807.54s)]
*  Wow. [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2809.18s)]
*  I will say this, I went to Easter one time at his house, [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2810.02s)]
*  and my kids, they were still living in California [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2812.58s)]
*  with my wife, and, because I took the Alabama job, [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2815.8199999999997s)]
*  and then they came for Easter, [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2819.94s)]
*  and he invited us over, and we went over there, [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2822.14s)]
*  and he was different. [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2827.38s)]
*  Now he didn't put on like a bunny costume, [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2828.8599999999997s)]
*  but like he was helping the kids with like the Easter eggs [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2830.62s)]
*  and he had one grandkid at the time, [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2835.1400000000003s)]
*  and he was like carrying around, [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2837.5s)]
*  and it was totally different than the office Nick Saban [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2839.46s)]
*  that we would see all the time. [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2842.26s)]
*  So that was pretty cool to see that side of him. [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2844.5s)]
*  Now he's also so competitive that he, [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2847.02s)]
*  his grandkid was like one, [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2849.9s)]
*  and all of a sudden the grandkid found the golden egg, [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2851.1800000000003s)]
*  while he was with Coach way over there, [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2854.94s)]
*  so Coach also was gonna make sure that he won. [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2856.82s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2859.1s)]
*  But it was pretty cool to see him like that. [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2859.94s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah, you gotta be different. [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2862.38s)]
*  When Jesus is making a comeback, [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2864.9s)]
*  you can't play defense on that day, you know? [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2866.02s)]
*  That's when you gotta just call the dogs off, I feel like. [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2868.22s)]
*  But it is definitely skeptical [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2871.98s)]
*  that a one-year-old found a golden egg. [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2873.3399999999997s)]
*  Was he playing against other kids, like of age children? [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2876.2999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, mine were like eight, 10, and 12. [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2879.2999999999997s)]
*  Oh, God. [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2881.94s)]
*  That's sad. [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2884.2999999999997s)]
*  But yeah, winners win, you know? [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2885.8599999999997s)]
*  That's what they say. [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2887.3399999999997s)]
*  Do you think that Coach Saban misses coaching? [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2888.62s)]
*  I do. [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2891.5s)]
*  I think that, and he mentioned that in that Pivot podcast, [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2893.3s)]
*  but I did always think, okay, if he was gonna do this, [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2895.7000000000003s)]
*  he was gonna have to have, [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2897.94s)]
*  and I used to say he's gonna have to kind of have that [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2899.26s)]
*  college game day spot, [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2902.1000000000004s)]
*  because he's gonna want to still like be involved. [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2903.42s)]
*  You know, he's just so wired to all day long [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2906.34s)]
*  to do something for his entire life. [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2908.78s)]
*  Now he ain't, he's not gonna sit around [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2910.2200000000003s)]
*  and just, you know, be a grandpa. [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2913.78s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2915.94s)]
*  That's not him. [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2916.78s)]
*  So I think because of that, that's helped a lot. [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2917.7400000000002s)]
*  I wouldn't actually be surprised if he came back in the NFL [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2921.38s)]
*  even, you know, as head coach, [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2924.38s)]
*  because he just, he's so good at it, [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2926.86s)]
*  and so in him that I'm not sure he won't come back. [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2928.94s)]
*  What, I want to talk about the NIL, [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2933.2200000000003s)]
*  and then I want to talk about your team in Ole Miss here. [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2935.42s)]
*  Does, God, I sound like a sports guy or something. [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2938.86s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2941.9s)]
*  What am I even doing today? [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2942.7400000000002s)]
*  Yeah, you're getting really like, [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2943.5800000000004s)]
*  I know, sad. [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2944.42s)]
*  I feel like going into this, I was gonna, [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2945.26s)]
*  we were gonna go a lot of different directions, [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2946.7400000000002s)]
*  and now you've come back to like, [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2948.26s)]
*  I think people will probably have turned off by now. [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2951.06s)]
*  I know, I feel like. [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2952.5s)]
*  Oh, dude, hey, tell us about your depth at safety this year. [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2953.34s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2957.5s)]
*  Yeah, how do you guys feel about third down package? [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2958.34s)]
*  Nobody wants to hear that. [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2962.34s)]
*  I don't know, my first down package is pretty small, [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2963.3s)]
*  I'll tell you that, that's an old wiener joke. [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2965.78s)]
*  See, then, here we go, now we're more, [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2968.94s)]
*  there we go. [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2971.3s)]
*  Yes, they're turning back on. [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2972.14s)]
*  I want to tell you about the, like, NIL, [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2972.98s)]
*  do you have to spend more time recruiting players [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2974.94s)]
*  or boosters these days with NIL? [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2976.86s)]
*  Yeah, a lot of booster part, [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2979.82s)]
*  because they gotta get the resources to pay. [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2982.86s)]
*  Now, that's gonna get a little bit moved now [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2985.38s)]
*  with revenue sharing and coming from the school, [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2987.0600000000004s)]
*  but these last few years has been, okay, [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2989.98s)]
*  well, the boosters have to create these collectives [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2992.38s)]
*  and have to source the money to pay the players. [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2994.94s)]
*  So if you don't have the money, you don't have the payroll, [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2998.02s)]
*  it's hard to get players. [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=2999.94s)]
*  And if you see, it's not hard to look at [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=3001.02s)]
*  who just won in basketball, [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=3004.7000000000003s)]
*  the programs that made the final four, [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=3006.1800000000003s)]
*  look at what the final four college football teams, [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=3007.54s)]
*  like, they're major programs [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=3011.02s)]
*  that have a lot of financial resources. [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=3012.54s)]
*  So yeah, you gotta do a lot of that, [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=3014.3s)]
*  and then you gotta convince the players. [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=3019.02s)]
*  Now, where it's different is the old school, [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=3020.38s)]
*  unfortunately, kind of, [[00:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=3023.34s)]
*  the old school recruiting of the relationships [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=3024.74s)]
*  and having a relationship three years [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=3027.7799999999997s)]
*  since the kid was a sophomore in high school and stuff, [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=3029.42s)]
*  that's not as important anymore, [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=3032.38s)]

*  The school's this, the school's this, the school's this, [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=3037.78s)]
*  and most of them usually go to the higher number. [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=3039.7000000000003s)]
*  And is that just a real question out of the gate, [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=3043.5800000000004s)]
*  is what does he offer? [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=3045.1800000000003s)]
*  Yeah. Wow. [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=3046.0200000000004s)]

*  Yeah, it's now just transitioned [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=3050.26s)]
*  to where most of them have agents now. [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=3052.0600000000004s)]
*  That's trash. [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=3053.6600000000003s)]
*  It's really, we're in my office right here, [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=3054.9s)]

*  and the recruits sit over there where your guys are, [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=3059.42s)]
*  and the parents, and I said this to our staff the other day, [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=3061.78s)]
*  I've sat in so many of these meetings, [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=3065.46s)]
*  like whatever, say the last 100, [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=3067.26s)]

*  what's your graduation rate? [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=3071.5s)]
*  I never hear anymore, like, what's the academic plan? [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=3073.42s)]
*  And it's just kind of sad, these are the parents, [[00:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=3077.02s)]
*  which is what it is, [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=3079.86s)]
*  and then I go, okay, well, when's our NIL meeting? [[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=3081.26s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=3083.42s)]

*  Like, I'm not mad about it, but it's just kind of sad. [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=3086.7s)]
*  Yeah, you just recognize it. [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=3090.18s)]
*  And I'm also recognizing it to say, [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=3091.02s)]
*  I don't believe long-term that's good for the kids. [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=3094.6400000000003s)]
*  So this has been great for players to make some money, [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=3097.28s)]
*  but it's so much money, and it's so much focus on the money [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=3099.5200000000004s)]
*  that then it's like, okay, well, then what's next? [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=3103.96s)]
*  If I'm already getting the money when I'm 18, then what? [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=3105.5600000000004s)]
*  Right. [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=3108.96s)]
*  You've seen this all the time. [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=3109.8s)]
*  People get too much too early, and then what? [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=3110.76s)]
*  They crash. [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=3114.1200000000003s)]
*  So- Crash out. [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=3114.96s)]
*  Yes, and I feel like we're creating a lot of that in this, [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=3116.4s)]
*  and now a kid's sitting there listening to his parents at, [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=3119.6000000000004s)]
*  and they want to know the money. [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=3121.88s)]
*  So what's the kid supposed to want to know? [[00:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=3123.8s)]
*  Yeah, it's crazy. [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=3125.8s)]
*  I agree. [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=3127.28s)]
*  That's bonkers, dude. [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=3129.04s)]
*  Yeah, if I'd have had some money, [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=3131.04s)]
*  I'd have fucking left school [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=3132.1600000000003s)]
*  the second you gave me that check. [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=3133.4s)]
*  I'd have driven across country and got me some damn dope, boy. [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=3135.48s)]
*  But I'm sure at that time you thought, man, [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=3138.1200000000003s)]
*  if I just had a million dollars, man, I'd have no problems. [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=3140.2000000000003s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=3143.6000000000004s)]
*  Then life would be great. [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=3144.6800000000003s)]
*  I heard all the time, these players, I just get money, man. [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=3146.32s)]
*  Players, I hear it from adults. [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=3149.88s)]
*  If I get money, man, I don't have problems. [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=3151.48s)]
*  Then I'll be good. [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=3152.92s)]
*  Okay. [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=3154.28s)]
*  We'll see. We'll see. [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=3155.48s)]
*  Now, I go into homes and recruiting over all these years. [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=3156.6s)]
*  I see the most problems in the families with the most money. [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=3160.16s)]
*  Most money, most success, [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=3164.08s)]
*  and then I don't feel any warmth in that room. [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=3165.36s)]
*  I don't feel the connection with the kids. [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=3167.96s)]
*  And then I'll go to a house here in Mississippi or Louisiana, [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=3170.28s)]
*  and there'll be 10 people living in this two-bedroom house. [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=3174.68s)]
*  And you just feel the warmth and the closeness and everything, [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=3178.0s)]
*  and then you got hardly anything financially. [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=3182.0s)]
*  But then they have this love and this family. [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=3185.36s)]
*  And I've just done this for a long time, [[00:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=3187.56s)]
*  and I see it usually the other way around. [[00:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=3190.32s)]
*  The bigger the houses, the more cars, the more money, [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=3192.52s)]
*  the more problems. [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=3199.0s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah, that's what they said. [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=3200.0s)]
*  Jay-Z said it, didn't he? [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=3202.84s)]
*  Biggie said it. [[00:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=3205.76s)]
*  Yeah, whoever said it got murdered, I remember that. [[00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=3207.92s)]
*  You know, April is Financial Literacy Month, [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=3212.16s)]
*  and that makes me think, well, how did I first learn about money? [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=3216.32s)]
*  Well, I guess... [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=3220.44s)]
*  Well, I got a little job that a lady paid me to catch these cats she had, [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=3222.68s)]
*  and she gave me a little bit of money. [[00:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=3227.28s)]
*  And I would take that money and I would store it. [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=3228.92s)]
*  I had one of those Crown Royal bags, [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=3231.52s)]
*  one of the purple bags that came in, [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=3234.4s)]

*  They want to get the money. [[00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=3429.4399999999996s)]
*  Well, I'm getting the money already. [[00:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=3430.16s)]
*  So now that's now I've lost some drive there. [[00:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=3431.6s)]
*  Right. [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=3434.72s)]
*  And they just get in their own ways, you know, and they get so much attention so early and so much. [[00:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=3435.36s)]
*  And then it's like they just think it's going to last forever. [[00:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=3443.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=3446.88s)]
*  And they just like they just screwed up. [[00:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=3447.2799999999997s)]
*  So they get in their own ways. [[00:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=3449.8399999999997s)]
*  And it's usually that one word ego. [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=3452.0s)]
*  What's the craziest thing a player's ever asked you for? [[00:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=3456.48s)]
*  It's like point blank. [[00:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=3458.4s)]
*  Have they ever been like, I need to give me a Jaguar coach or something like that, [[00:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=3459.28s)]
*  like the animal or the car? [[00:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=3463.52s)]
*  Not the animal. [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=3466.1600000000003s)]
*  I wouldn't say create like I don't have a good story, like a crazy thing, you know, like, [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=3468.7200000000003s)]
*  but it just what continues to blow my mind in nowadays is they want more when they haven't [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=3474.4s)]
*  done anything new, meaning like, okay, here's what I got. [[00:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=3482.0s)]
*  I got this to come, you know, to transfer to come around high school. [[00:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=3484.32s)]
*  And then they come in like, okay, well, I need more. [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=3487.76s)]
*  And they're like, well, you didn't do anything. [[00:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=3489.76s)]
*  Like, you have a good year. [[00:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=3492.0s)]
*  Well, why would you get more? [[00:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=3495.36s)]
*  Like, it's just that mindset of like, I just deserve more. [[00:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=3496.96s)]
*  Like I deserve more and more because there's no there's no appreciation in there for where [[00:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=3501.92s)]
*  they're at or like, man, I got to play better to get more just I'm supposed to get more. [[00:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=3506.7200000000003s)]
*  And that happens all the time. [[00:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=3510.6400000000003s)]
*  There's two transfer portal windows. [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=3512.48s)]
*  So like, if you could negotiate your contract twice a year, every year, but then for six [[00:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=3514.24s)]
*  months, you haven't done a show. [[00:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=3519.6s)]
*  You haven't done anything. [[00:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=3521.12s)]
*  But after that six month period, you want a new contract and a new deal bigger than [[00:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=3521.8399999999997s)]
*  what you had, but you hadn't done anything. [[00:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=3525.9199999999996s)]
*  Or maybe you screwed the shows up, right through interceptions, but you still want more. [[00:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=3527.8399999999997s)]
*  So it's just, and it's not even their fault. [[00:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=3532.56s)]
*  There's the parents. [[00:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=3534.3999999999996s)]
*  Now you got agents like, do you still feel like a coach? [[00:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=3535.2s)]
*  Do you feel like a banker more? [[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=3538.56s)]
*  It's not really like a banker, but you spend so much time not coaching. [[00:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=3540.2400000000002s)]
*  And I think that's part of the Nick Saban and, you know, getting out. [[00:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=3545.0400000000004s)]
*  It's just like, it just changed, you know, because these conversations, these things, [[00:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=3548.88s)]
*  and you see the like greed for it, you know, like, but it's a it's unique because from [[00:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=3553.28s)]
*  someone that's been fortunate to make money, have success, get to the highest levels, like [[00:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=3560.5600000000004s)]
*  it's like, I keep trying to tell them, like, that's not going to be the answer. [[00:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=3566.16s)]
*  Right. [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=3570.08s)]
*  Like that new contract, getting that much more money isn't going to change anything. [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=3570.24s)]
*  You're not going to, you know, be happier because of, but it's like, they don't, you [[00:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=3575.68s)]
*  can't hear it. [[00:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=3580.56s)]
*  Yes. [[00:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=3581.3599999999997s)]
*  Kids can't hear it. [[00:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=3582.08s)]
*  Cannot. [[00:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=3582.96s)]
*  I can sit in these two chairs right here to some, some, most of them, some will, but most [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=3583.52s)]
*  of them. [[00:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=3589.04s)]
*  And they just look at me like, there's no one. [[00:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=3590.24s)]
*  I'm like, listen to me until you fix these internal problems, until you fix how you think [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=3592.24s)]
*  that everybody's against you or whatever it is, these issues that they each have. [[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=3596.8s)]
*  And I'll try to like work through them. [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=3600.4s)]
*  I'm like that, that money, that new contract, that next car, that next girl, like that's [[01:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=3601.6s)]
*  not going to fix that. [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=3607.52s)]
*  And like, if I get picked in the first round, I got that contract, everything is fixed. [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=3608.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=3614.8s)]
*  Coach, I don't care what you say. [[01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=3615.12s)]

*  So what is some of your push for players to come here to Ole Miss these days? [[01:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=3649.52s)]
*  Like, what is it, you know, what do you sell them on about being here? [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=3653.2799999999997s)]

*  And so I got to see that as a parent, my daughter Landry's a sophomore here. [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=3660.24s)]

*  Like, you can't do like a makeup TikTok with your daughter. [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=3684.32s)]
*  And I'm like, I don't want to be gone someday. [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=3686.88s)]
*  I'm going to be dead or I'm going to be at the end of it. [[01:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=3689.36s)]
*  You know, those last couple of years, you think I'm going to be like, man, I wish I [[01:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=3691.76s)]

*  You might crush it in the morning. [[01:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=3769.2s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=3770.24s)]
*  I mean, look, I don't want to have to do yoga or have to wear cleats is the only thing that [[01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=3770.72s)]
*  I'm thinking. [[01:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=3774.24s)]
*  There's no cleats. [[01:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=3774.32s)]
*  No cleats. [[01:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=3775.2s)]
*  That's all I'm wondering. [[01:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=3775.92s)]
*  But no, I think you're right, man. [[01:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=3776.96s)]
*  Yeah, I think, well, it also goes back to what you said. [[01:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=3778.32s)]
*  It's like, you know, you don't like to follow this old playbook about things. [[01:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=3780.24s)]
*  You like to have this new playbook about things. [[01:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=3782.8s)]
*  What's kind of like part of that that you offer your players or people that want to [[01:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=3784.8s)]
*  come down here? [[01:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=3787.76s)]
*  Do you sell them like, hey, this is a team that's like this is a program that's [[01:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=3788.48s)]
*  obviously it's gone. [[01:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=3792.64s)]
*  You know, the trajectory has gone up, you know, especially in the past five years, [[01:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=3793.84s)]
*  for sure, in the past decade. [[01:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=3797.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=3799.84s)]
*  What do you kind of push them on? [[01:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=3800.08s)]
*  How do you get players to come here to Ole Miss? [[01:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=3801.2s)]
*  Because it's always been a little bit more of the underdog in the SEC. [[01:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=3803.6s)]
*  Yeah, I think the kids really like we create an atmosphere that you want to be at, not have [[01:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=3806.64s)]
*  to. [[01:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=3812.2400000000002s)]
*  Same with our employees. [[01:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=3812.56s)]
*  You know, like I feel like in the morning, if you ask them when they're getting up [[01:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=3813.92s)]
*  and they're driving their cars over, whether it's players or staff, like they want to be [[01:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=3817.2s)]
*  here. [[01:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=3821.7599999999998s)]
*  Yeah, the GM had a damn Zen in, I think. [[01:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=3821.9199999999996s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, he does. [[01:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=3823.9199999999996s)]
*  He's working on it. [[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=3824.7999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, he's trying to quit. [[01:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=3825.68s)]
*  He's trying to quit some other things. [[01:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=3826.48s)]
*  Yeah, he's been there, done that. [[01:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=3827.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=3830.3999999999996s)]
*  But that atmosphere of comfortable and like the players, like I've been around both [[01:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=3831.68s)]
*  and I've been around as an employee where you're miserable driving in like another day. [[01:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=3838.08s)]
*  Like, and it's just like, to me, you're not very productive that way. [[01:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=3842.16s)]
*  Like, I want our players to come here and like they play their own playlists, like in [[01:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=3845.36s)]
*  practice and stuff, you know, like it's a players team with discipline. [[01:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=3849.76s)]
*  But the same thing around the office, like people, we don't even have hours. [[01:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=3853.84s)]
*  Like you don't even have like you leave when you're done with your work. [[01:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=3856.7200000000003s)]
*  I'm like, OK, you leave at this time because then people just sit there and guard their [[01:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=3859.52s)]
*  desk, you know, till the time goes. [[01:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=3864.2400000000002s)]
*  So I just try to create an atmosphere that people really want to be at. [[01:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=3866.08s)]
*  And they have a lot of fun doing it. [[01:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=3870.0s)]
*  And it's really to me, it's awesome if you can win and have fun, because some programs [[01:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=3872.08s)]
*  like they win, but they're still miserable. [[01:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=3876.96s)]
*  And I've seen that. [[01:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=3879.52s)]
*  So we try to create this atmosphere and I think people love it. [[01:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=3880.56s)]
*  Is it tough to be like a coach and a dad because you have three children, right? [[01:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=3884.08s)]
*  And is it tough to be like a coach and a dad and a coach and a husband? [[01:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=3888.3199999999997s)]
*  Like, what's that? [[01:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=3891.84s)]
*  What is the cross of like those jobs like for a coach? [[01:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=3892.7999999999997s)]
*  Because it takes a lot of time. [[01:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=3896.7999999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=3898.4s)]
*  I think like a lot of questions, I answer them differently now than I did five, ten, [[01:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=3899.62s)]
*  fifteen years ago. [[01:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=3905.38s)]
*  I think, you know, as I look back and I use my failures and experiences now, it's awesome [[01:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=3908.34s)]
*  because I get to use to help others. [[01:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=3915.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=3917.06s)]
*  And I help our players when they're going through it. [[01:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=3917.46s)]
*  So I like that I had a lot of stuff happen to me or self-inflicted stuff. [[01:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=3919.2200000000003s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[01:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=3924.6600000000003s)]
*  That like I struggled for a long time. [[01:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=3925.46s)]
*  But then as I like now see like I get to help like because a coach knows my story or players [[01:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=3929.3s)]
*  and they come in, I can help them with things. [[01:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=3934.02s)]
*  Like when you say, OK, how did like the balance of a husband, father and head coach? [[01:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=3935.86s)]
*  Well, I failed at that because I'm as a head coach, like I was a head coach, Tennessee USC. [[01:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=3941.7s)]
*  And I was like, that was my higher power. [[01:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=3948.7400000000002s)]
*  And I'm the head coach USC. [[01:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=3950.98s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=3953.06s)]
*  That's who I am. [[01:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=3954.44s)]
*  Not like, oh, I'm a husband, not I'm a father. [[01:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=3956.12s)]
*  Like that became my higher power. [[01:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=3958.7599999999998s)]
*  That was the most important thing to me. [[01:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=3960.52s)]
*  And I could feel it because I'd be like, oh, we'd win. [[01:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=3962.7599999999998s)]
*  So then like the LA Times Sunday morning, man, Coach Lane Kiffin, you know, like, [[01:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=3966.2799999999997s)]
*  and like, what do you want? [[01:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=3970.44s)]
*  And I remember him asking me like, what do you want? [[01:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=3973.72s)]
*  Someday I'm like a statue. [[01:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=3978.36s)]
*  Like Nick Saban because then I made it like they built a statue of me [[01:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=3980.84s)]
*  because I won so many games and championships. [[01:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=3984.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=3987.08s)]
*  That's what I want. [[01:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=3987.48s)]
*  But I was totally missing it because if you ask me that now, what do you want? [[01:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=3989.56s)]
*  You know what I want? [[01:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=3993.2400000000002s)]
*  I want to be a really good dad. [[01:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=3994.12s)]
*  I want to be a really good boss, a really good friend, a really good neighbor. [[01:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=3996.04s)]
*  The other stuff happens with the wins. [[01:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=4001.0s)]
*  That's fine. [[01:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=4003.0s)]
*  But I was so focused on that that it controlled everything. [[01:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=4003.4s)]
*  I just slept at the office all week long because like we had to win. [[01:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=4007.8s)]
*  That's all that matters. [[01:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=4011.0s)]
*  And like John Daly used to sleep at a Hooters. [[01:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=4012.52s)]
*  Yeah, that was a little different. [[01:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=4015.32s)]
*  Yeah, that's true. [[01:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=4017.56s)]
*  He didn't even work there. [[01:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=4018.6s)]
*  It's not like he was, you know, working on chipping at Hooters. [[01:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=4019.56s)]
*  Yeah, that's true. [[01:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=4023.48s)]
*  Short game. [[01:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=4024.12s)]
*  Yeah, that's a good point. [[01:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=4024.92s)]
*  So I don't know why I said that, but yeah, people sleep at the office. [[01:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=4026.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=4029.96s)]
*  I think John Daly still goes to Hooters for like John Daly two hour signing special. [[01:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=4033.8s)]
*  I love JD, by the way. [[01:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=4038.84s)]
*  Oh, of course, dude. [[01:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=4039.96s)]
*  He's awesome. [[01:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=4040.76s)]
*  We talk about him every single week. [[01:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=4041.32s)]
*  There he is right there. [[01:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=4043.2400000000002s)]
*  Oh, he's got that two pack. [[01:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=4045.96s)]
*  Boy, he's off a couple of honey packs right there. [[01:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=4049.48s)]
*  Look at him. [[01:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=4051.32s)]
*  That's where I won't comment. [[01:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=4053.56s)]
*  Head coach. [[01:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=4054.76s)]
*  Okay. [[01:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=4055.48s)]
*  So anyway, so that's where this failure came in because it was like, okay, [[01:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=4057.2400000000002s)]
*  if you're going to put all that this is the most important thing to you, [[01:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=4060.52s)]
*  then I like look back and shoot. [[01:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=4064.2s)]
*  No wonder like I ended up getting divorced. [[01:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=4065.88s)]
*  No wonder that, you know, I end up having a strained relationship with my kids. [[01:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=4067.64s)]
*  And then I kind of figured this out later on and started going, okay, wait, wait a second. [[01:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=4071.8s)]
*  This is just part of who I am, you know, being a coach. [[01:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=4077.24s)]
*  And then I started to work on the other areas of my life. [[01:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=4081.16s)]
*  Got sober from a lot of things, really. [[01:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=4085.16s)]
*  Just not just physical sober, like stop drinking, but like emotionally sober, [[01:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=4087.96s)]
*  you know, like, and that's still a constant battle working on that. [[01:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=4093.64s)]
*  Like, and things not making me go way up, way down, like every day. [[01:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=4096.36s)]
*  But and people say, okay, well, what do you do? [[01:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=4101.24s)]
*  You don't drink. [[01:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=4104.28s)]
*  Like, what do you do? [[01:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=4105.0s)]
*  Like Thursday? [[01:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=4105.5599999999995s)]
*  And I was like, what's replaced that is like amazing. [[01:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=4106.2s)]
*  Like going to dinner with Landry or watch a movie with her friends. [[01:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=4110.2s)]
*  You know, like you just I just had this shift and it really helped me. [[01:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=4114.360000000001s)]
*  And actually, I'm a better coach out of it, which you wouldn't think would be like, [[01:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=4121.08s)]
*  because you think, oh, well, if you put everything into it, [[01:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=4124.04s)]
*  but then you lose balance and you're just kind of off and everything is so defined on a win or loss [[01:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=4126.360000000001s)]
*  that like it's everything. [[01:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=4132.04s)]
*  I remember like losing a really, really important game. [[01:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=4133.400000000001s)]
*  And I remember at the time, like seeing why she's like, [[01:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=4138.360000000001s)]
*  and I'm like, I don't want to wake up. [[01:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=4140.52s)]
*  We actually lost USC. [[01:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=4141.64s)]
*  We lost to Texas. [[01:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=4142.84s)]
*  We were on our third straight national championship, lost in the Rose Bowl national championship, [[01:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=4144.360000000001s)]
*  Ben Chong, Kentucky. [[01:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=4149.0s)]
*  I'm like, I don't want to wake up tomorrow. [[01:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=4150.76s)]
*  She said, what is wrong with you? [[01:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=4152.68s)]
*  We had one kid at a time, Landry. [[01:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=4154.280000000001s)]
*  And she's like, you have a kid like you have a whole life. [[01:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=4155.72s)]
*  We lost the game, third straight national championship. [[01:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=4158.76s)]
*  How long is it going to take to ever get there again? [[01:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=4162.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=4164.04s)]
*  But I was just so out of whack on that because that's I mentioned earlier that the, [[01:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=4164.76s)]
*  that the ego had gotten so big when I became a head coach and all the money and success [[01:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=4170.36s)]
*  and attention that like it just built and like, you got to keep feeding it. [[01:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=4176.2s)]
*  And so it's really been cool to get out of that spot. [[01:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=4182.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=4185.72s)]
*  And what do you attribute to helping you get out of it? [[01:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=4185.96s)]
*  Probably lifestyle change. [[01:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=4187.48s)]
*  You know, I came to Mississippi and decided like, okay, I started eating more food, [[01:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=4191.96s)]
*  not working out. [[01:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=4199.24s)]
*  Like, and I just was like, man, I'm not the best version of myself. [[01:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=4200.2s)]
*  I didn't have this like rock bottom moment, you know, that people have. [[01:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=4203.719999999999s)]
*  Sometimes I just was like, man, I don't really like this lower version of myself. [[01:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=4206.599999999999s)]
*  I want to be the highest version of myself. [[01:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=4212.12s)]
*  So I changed my diet. [[01:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=4213.719999999999s)]
*  I stopped the alcohol. [[01:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=4215.08s)]
*  I started working out. [[01:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=4216.5199999999995s)]
*  And really what I started to do is to pour into other people [[01:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=4219.4s)]
*  instead of just pouring into myself. [[01:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=4222.679999999999s)]
*  Dang coach, you're making me feel bad about my life, bruh. [[01:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=4225.4s)]
*  You're younger than me. [[01:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=4229.24s)]
*  You used to get there, but it's a daily battle. [[01:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=4230.2s)]
*  It is, man. [[01:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=4233.08s)]
*  And especially that emotional sobriety. [[01:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=4233.88s)]
*  That's my biggest issue, dude. [[01:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=4235.32s)]
*  I mean, I have a certain emotion and I get literally drunk off of it or high off of it. [[01:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=4237.32s)]
*  Or the other way I get depressed. [[01:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=4242.599999999999s)]
*  It's like, it's like those are like my drugs. [[01:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=4244.12s)]
*  A lot of times any feeling that I have. [[01:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=4246.679999999999s)]
*  I'm still there. [[01:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=4249.0s)]
*  Like that's a daily battle. [[01:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=4249.8s)]
*  God, boy. [[01:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=4251.719999999999s)]
*  And I really got on this after the physical sobriety after a couple years of, okay, well, [[01:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=4252.44s)]
*  I got really healthy working out all the time and don't drink. [[01:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=4256.84s)]
*  But it was like, okay, but I still was letting people, situations like, man, well, that went [[01:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=4259.96s)]
*  my way. [[01:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=4266.280000000001s)]
*  So everything's good. [[01:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=4266.68s)]
*  Oh, that didn't go that way. [[01:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=4268.52s)]
*  We lose that recruit or have an argument with this person. [[01:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=4269.4800000000005s)]
*  And like everything's terrible. [[01:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=4271.8s)]
*  And I was like, man. [[01:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=4272.92s)]
*  And I had somebody tell me like, remember the tide goes in and out every day. [[01:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=4274.92s)]
*  Like it's going to. [[01:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=4279.64s)]
*  And like, do you just get freaked out by that or are you just like, hey, the tide came in. [[01:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=4281.56s)]
*  Tide went out. [[01:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=4285.400000000001s)]
*  And so I really try to do that because like I'll do the yoga. [[01:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=4286.12s)]
*  Everything's good, man. [[01:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=4289.88s)]
*  And I'll come in here and then this player has this issue, you know, or a kid has this issue, [[01:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=4290.84s)]
*  you know, and then it's like, or this doesn't go this way that especially like if you're like me, [[01:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=4296.5199999999995s)]
*  which I feel like you are from your last answer when somebody doesn't do what you want them to do. [[01:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=4301.08s)]
*  Like, wait, everything would be good, man. [[01:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=4306.599999999999s)]
*  If he just wouldn't say that. [[01:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=4309.0s)]
*  Sorry. [[01:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=4310.5199999999995s)]
*  And I'll believe this. [[01:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=4311.0s)]
*  If she does this, if he does that and they do that, I'll be good. [[01:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=4311.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=4314.92s)]
*  Well, wait, they don't. [[01:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=4315.32s)]
*  And it never is going to happen. [[01:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=4317.0s)]
*  It's just total unrealistic expectations of what I have a lot of times. [[01:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=4318.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=4321.5599999999995s)]
*  And that's when our biggest thing is unrealistic expectations. [[01:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=4321.96s)]
*  Like expecting the tide not to come in. [[01:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=4325.88s)]
*  Yes. [[01:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=4328.2s)]
*  That's what it'd be like. [[01:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=4328.44s)]
*  Everybody to do things exactly. [[01:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=4329.24s)]
*  I want to expect that people know how I want things done after I haven't shared how I want them done. [[01:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=4330.44s)]
*  That's my biggest thing. [[01:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=4334.2s)]
*  Like expecting somebody to know what I want them to do, but I've never even told them exactly what I [[01:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=4335.719999999999s)]
*  want. [[01:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=4339.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=4339.88s)]
*  And that's a crazy person with things that way. [[01:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=4340.679999999999s)]
*  So yeah. [[01:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=4342.759999999999s)]
*  Or I did this. [[01:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=4343.32s)]
*  I'm not doing this. [[01:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=4344.44s)]
*  And then they don't deal. [[01:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=4344.92s)]
*  And then they don't act how I want them to act after what I did. [[01:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=4346.4400000000005s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=4350.52s)]
*  Haven't I shared with you? [[01:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=4350.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=4353.4800000000005s)]
*  But there is a major problem that when you become and you're in charge of company, [[01:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=4354.2s)]
*  you're head coach, you know, like, and all the people are working for you. [[01:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=4358.12s)]
*  So your whole day, they really are doing what you want. [[01:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=4361.0s)]
*  And then now in your personal life outside of it, maybe somebody doesn't do what you want. [[01:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=4364.92s)]
*  And then you lose your mind. [[01:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=4370.68s)]
*  That's where I was off with the emotional part. [[01:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=4372.36s)]
*  You know, and had to like work on that part. [[01:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=4375.240000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=4377.96s)]
*  I can't imagine I'm really a coach. [[01:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=4378.84s)]
*  It would be hard. [[01:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=4380.360000000001s)]
*  I can't even coach myself. [[01:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=4380.92s)]
*  So you've really taken the Oxford coach. [[01:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=4383.8s)]
*  I noticed that your son is moving here, right? [[01:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=4385.72s)]
*  Is that true? [[01:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=4388.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=4389.400000000001s)]
*  So my daughter goes to school here. [[01:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=4389.72s)]
*  Okay. [[01:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=4392.04s)]
*  And she's a sophomore. [[01:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=4392.4400000000005s)]
*  She's a sophomore. [[01:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=4393.4800000000005s)]
*  Okay. [[01:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=4394.200000000001s)]
*  My other daughter's going to college at USC and then my son is moving here. [[01:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=4394.4400000000005s)]
*  He's actually on a spring break here right now. [[01:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=4398.4400000000005s)]
*  And he's moving here next month. [[01:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=4400.76s)]
*  And he's going to go to Oxford High. [[01:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=4402.52s)]
*  He is. [[01:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=4404.04s)]
*  Nice. [[01:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=4404.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=4405.0s)]
*  And he plays football too or no? [[01:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=4405.88s)]
*  He does. [[01:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=4407.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=4408.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=4409.0s)]
*  He's, he's quarterback. [[01:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=4409.32s)]
*  He's got a chance to be good. [[01:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=4410.84s)]
*  So that'll be exciting to be able to watch all his games here. [[01:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=4413.24s)]
*  And he's always up here working out with his buddies. [[01:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=4415.72s)]
*  So, oh, that's going to be great just to be around that much, that many other players and stuff. [[01:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=4417.72s)]
*  It's awesome. [[01:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=4422.28s)]
*  I was, my dad was a coach. [[01:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=4422.84s)]
*  I grew up as a coach's kid that to be around those locker rooms and to be around those players [[01:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=4424.44s)]
*  and to learn from them, it's, it's, it's so awesome and so motivating. [[01:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=4429.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=4432.68s)]
*  Did you have a good relationship with your dad? [[01:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=4433.48s)]
*  I know your dad was Monty Keffin. [[01:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=4434.679999999999s)]
*  Yep. [[01:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=4435.959999999999s)]
*  And did you have, did you guys have a good relationship? [[01:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=4436.44s)]
*  Amazing. [[01:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=4438.2s)]
*  So he passed in July and. [[01:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=4439.0s)]
*  Was he sick? [[01:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=4441.799999999999s)]
*  Was he pretty sick at the end of his life? [[01:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=4442.5199999999995s)]
*  He had dementia and so he slowed down a lot. [[01:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=4443.4s)]
*  But here's what's really cool. [[01:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=4445.959999999999s)]
*  You know, I'm just saying like the pain of discipline or the pain of regret. [[01:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=4447.32s)]
*  Like we probably have the pain of regret from things we weren't disciplined at in life. [[01:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=4451.4s)]
*  You know, if you look back, man, if I wouldn't have done that or like I would have got, [[01:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=4456.839999999999s)]
*  you know, made different decisions. [[01:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=4461.0s)]
*  So now I have the pain of the regret of that. [[01:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=4462.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=4465.160000000001s)]
*  Well, I think a lot of times people with parents sometimes like when they pass, [[01:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=4466.360000000001s)]
*  you know, they have the pain of regret. [[01:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=4470.52s)]
*  Man, we should have been around him more. [[01:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=4471.72s)]
*  I didn't go to see him. [[01:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=4473.240000000001s)]
*  Well, my dad worked for me all the way up till the end of 84. [[01:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=4474.92s)]
*  So all these last three stops, he was here in the building helping us coach. [[01:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=4479.4800000000005s)]
*  Oh, that's cool. [[01:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=4484.04s)]
*  So every day I would see him 15 times a day. [[01:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=4484.92s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[01:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=4487.8s)]
*  And he was such a coach that like even as doctors say that was keeping him alive [[01:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=4488.36s)]
*  because he could come into the office every day. [[01:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=4492.679999999999s)]
*  He's 84 years old with dementia, still coming in the office. [[01:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=4494.5199999999995s)]
*  And he just was like, he was the ultimate coach, the old school coach. [[01:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=4497.96s)]
*  And so I got to be with him every day all the way up. [[01:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=4501.4s)]
*  So because of that, of bringing him to all the places, [[01:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=4505.799999999999s)]
*  making sure he was at work every day and everything like. [[01:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=4508.36s)]
*  That was here. [[01:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=4510.92s)]
*  It'll miss. [[01:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=4511.32s)]
*  Wow. [[01:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=4511.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=4512.679999999999s)]
*  So if you don't come here, who knows if that even setup is even kind of perfect for that. [[01:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=4512.839999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=4516.44s)]
*  But that's where I've gotten to like, who knows what's supposed to be perfect. [[01:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=4517.08s)]
*  What I thought, what we thought as a plan should be, I was like totally off. [[01:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=4521.96s)]
*  Like I've been like, there's no way I'm going to like want to move to Oxford, Mississippi, [[01:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=4529.0s)]
*  have my kid go to college here, have my other kid go to high school here and love it. [[01:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=4534.44s)]
*  And now I do. [[01:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=4540.44s)]
*  And who would have thought they would have ever wanted to come here? [[01:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=4541.4s)]
*  It's like, you know, God's plan obviously makes a lot more sense than ours. [[01:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=4543.719999999999s)]
*  Because every time I take that and I'm like, wait, wait, wait, wait, maybe he wants to, [[01:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=4547.639999999999s)]
*  let me turn that over here. [[01:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=4551.639999999999s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[01:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=4552.679999999999s)]
*  My way. [[01:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=4553.24s)]
*  This is what I want to happen. [[01:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=4554.2s)]
*  Like these people need to do this. [[01:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=4555.4s)]
*  I need to go here. [[01:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=4557.639999999999s)]
*  I need to get that job. [[01:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=4558.36s)]
*  Let me control everything. [[01:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=4559.639999999999s)]
*  Yes. [[01:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=4560.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=4561.32s)]
*  And then then it just doesn't work. [[01:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=4562.12s)]
*  It really doesn't. [[01:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=4564.5199999999995s)]
*  And then when I just, which is hard, I just let go and just let it go. [[01:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=4565.4s)]
*  And whatever's going to happen is going to happen. [[01:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=4571.32s)]
*  And that tide is going to come in and it's going to go out. [[01:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=4573.0s)]
*  I'll just float along with it. [[01:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=4575.96s)]
*  The HOV lane, dude. [[01:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=4579.08s)]
*  What? [[01:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=4581.88s)]
*  Who caught that clipboard? [[01:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=4582.52s)]
*  Do you know? [[01:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=4583.72s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=4584.84s)]
*  They brought it back. [[01:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=4586.04s)]
*  They did? [[01:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=4586.84s)]
*  Yes. [[01:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=4587.56s)]
*  Mississippi nice. [[01:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=4588.2s)]
*  Oh, so sweet of them. [[01:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=4589.48s)]
*  Told you the people here are amazing. [[01:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=4590.76s)]
*  God, that was great. [[01:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=4593.72s)]
*  There's nothing as good as that. [[01:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=4595.0s)]
*  Because it's like when the plays work, it's like a video game. [[01:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=4596.28s)]
*  I feel like I'm playing a video game on the sideline. [[01:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=4599.16s)]
*  So think like when you play in a video game, you throw your controller. [[01:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=4601.24s)]
*  That's really what I'm doing. [[01:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=4604.36s)]
*  It's still the kid in me right there. [[01:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=4605.5599999999995s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=4606.92s)]
*  You know, like throw my clipboard like your controller. [[01:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=4607.32s)]
*  Out of the box. [[01:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=4610.2s)]
*  You've had quite a life, you know, you started kind of, you know, you didn't start, [[01:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=4612.28s)]
*  but you kind of came on a lot of people's radar and coaching at the highest level. [[01:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=4617.0s)]
*  Right. [[01:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=4620.2s)]
*  Step back into college football. [[01:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=4620.679999999999s)]
*  You've been a player. [[01:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=4623.0s)]
*  You've, you know, you've had like you kind of a polarizing, people would say, type figure, [[01:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=4624.28s)]
*  very unique in your own way. [[01:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=4630.44s)]
*  And I think after talking to me, I learned a little bit more about how you operate. [[01:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=4632.12s)]
*  So I can understand. [[01:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=4635.4s)]
*  But what is like a message you would get? [[01:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=4636.839999999999s)]
*  You know, you've had, you've been through divorce, you've been through, you have children. [[01:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=4639.799999999999s)]
*  You've had a lot of just experiences in your life. [[01:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=4644.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=4646.12s)]
*  What, for somebody out there who's getting into their middle age and is kind of struggling [[01:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=4646.759999999999s)]
*  with having a setback or something, what is, what is something you think you would share [[01:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=4653.32s)]
*  with them from your experience or a thought or statement or? [[01:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=4656.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=4661.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=4662.12s)]
*  I think that like they can do it. [[01:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=4663.16s)]
*  Like these things happen, you know, in life, these major obstacles that seem so horrible [[01:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=4665.16s)]
*  at the time, a divorce, firings, maybe you have a health scare, like these things that [[01:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=4670.28s)]
*  seem so terrible and they're really not, they just feel like it in the moment and they're [[01:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=4677.0s)]
*  going to pass and you're going to actually look back later on and be glad for them. [[01:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=4681.72s)]
*  Like my kind of major thing was I got fired as a head coach at USC and like my career is over. [[01:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=4685.96s)]
*  Well, that wouldn't happen. [[01:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=4691.4s)]
*  I wouldn't have gotten to work for Nick Saban for three years. [[01:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=4692.52s)]
*  You know, so like whatever those things are or. [[01:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=4695.08s)]
*  Your career has been over like four times. [[01:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=4697.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=4699.24s)]
*  That you can do it. [[01:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=4700.28s)]
*  And it's actually feels way better than like, let's say you come out, like I came up and [[01:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=4700.92s)]
*  got a lot of breaks because my dad and stuff. [[01:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=4706.36s)]
*  And so it's like, okay, I got to the top. [[01:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=4708.28s)]
*  Okay. [[01:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=4711.08s)]
*  Well, that felt good. [[01:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=4711.32s)]
*  But then to actually have it torn down and all taken away, some by circumstance, some by your [[01:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=4712.84s)]
*  own decisions and rebuild from the bottom personally and professionally, it feels so much better. [[01:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=4718.2s)]
*  It's like instead of buying the house, you build the house from the beginning. [[01:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=4724.12s)]
*  And so just for people that are struggling in whatever one of those areas may be, like you can [[01:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=4728.5199999999995s)]
*  do it, but don't get overwhelmed. [[01:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=4733.24s)]
*  Like it really is one day at a time. [[01:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=4735.08s)]
*  Like, Hey, just start working out today, you know, or. [[01:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=4737.72s)]
*  Stop drinking today, you know, or start being a better person today, whatever those areas are. [[01:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=4741.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=4746.92s)]
*  Just today, just today, man. [[01:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=4747.08s)]
*  Cause other stuff's overwhelming. [[01:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=4748.5199999999995s)]
*  We don't know what's going to happen next week, let alone next month or next year. [[01:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=4750.04s)]
*  And just be really good at it today. [[01:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=4754.36s)]
*  Amen, man. [[01:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=4757.8s)]
*  I needed to hear that. [[01:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=4758.5199999999995s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=4759.24s)]
*  There's something I've been like, I just feel like kind of the world is ending because [[01:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=4759.48s)]
*  of something that's kind of like just work stuff. [[01:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=4762.44s)]
*  And I'm like, what do I do? [[01:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=4764.44s)]
*  But I just have to look at it as a challenge, adjust the perspective. [[01:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=4765.4s)]
*  Zoom out. [[01:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=4769.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=4770.12s)]
*  Zoom out. [[01:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=4770.6s)]
*  See, watching my dad pass through the last couple of years of dementia, but also watching [[01:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHPzvLugy0A&t=4771.240000000001s)]
