# Teenage Easter  This Past Weekend w Theo Von #382
**Theo Von - This Past Weekend:** [March 01, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMxJT88P7Ew)
*  Oh, yeah, just got back, baby. Just got back off the road and [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMxJT88P7Ew&t=0.0s)]
*  just I'm going to go out to eat in a little while. And so I'm [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMxJT88P7Ew&t=7.0s)]
*  trying I was trying to get me a little tight, a little tight [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMxJT88P7Ew&t=13.0s)]
*  over, you know, snack, a little. I had me about nine almonds [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMxJT88P7Ew&t=16.0s)]
*  and and had me two yogurts. I'm gonna be honest with you. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMxJT88P7Ew&t=21.0s)]
*  You know, there's a time in my life where I, you know, I [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMxJT88P7Ew&t=29.0s)]
*  probably wouldn't have told anybody that I had yogurt, [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMxJT88P7Ew&t=34.0s)]
*  especially a man. I wouldn't say, hey, man, I just had just [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMxJT88P7Ew&t=36.0s)]
*  had some yogurts. You know, I'd have lied. I'd have lied and [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMxJT88P7Ew&t=39.0s)]
*  I'd have said, yeah, I just had some more, you know, some ice [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMxJT88P7Ew&t=44.0s)]
*  cream or something or some, you know, real warm ice cream. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMxJT88P7Ew&t=48.0s)]
*  But I like yogurt, man. I like it. But then there's that [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMxJT88P7Ew&t=54.0s)]
*  I mean, the thing it feels like it shouldn't be eating it. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMxJT88P7Ew&t=57.0s)]
*  And I'm not sure if I've spoken about this before, but it just [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMxJT88P7Ew&t=61.0s)]
*  feels like you just shouldn't be having it, doesn't it? [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMxJT88P7Ew&t=66.0s)]
*  It feels like you shouldn't be having it. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMxJT88P7Ew&t=69.0s)]
*  It just feels a little is it maybe it's just in my head. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMxJT88P7Ew&t=72.0s)]
*  It tastes like a look, I'm a you know, I got a little bit, you [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMxJT88P7Ew&t=79.0s)]
*  know, I got about probably seven percent pervert in me. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMxJT88P7Ew&t=83.0s)]
*  So when they crack me open, but it's going to be a little pervert [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMxJT88P7Ew&t=86.0s)]
*  jumps out and run, you know, runs across the Morgan, you know, [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMxJT88P7Ew&t=89.0s)]
*  up under the lockers or whatever. But, um, but yes, so I, you [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMxJT88P7Ew&t=93.0s)]
*  know, I don't I but there's something about it's just there's [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMxJT88P7Ew&t=100.0s)]
*  something about having a yogurt that just feel it's like I feel [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMxJT88P7Ew&t=105.0s)]
*  like there's the part of me that's that's it. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMxJT88P7Ew&t=109.0s)]
*  That's really I don't know. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMxJT88P7Ew&t=111.0s)]
*  It just seems like it's almost a little it seemed a little young [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMxJT88P7Ew&t=113.0s)]
*  or something. I don't know if that makes any sense to anybody. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMxJT88P7Ew&t=116.0s)]
*  And I may be insane. But, um, what's going on, guys? [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMxJT88P7Ew&t=119.0s)]
*  Um, just got back off the road. I'm going to talk about that. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMxJT88P7Ew&t=124.0s)]
*  Um, went to dinner the other night, went to like a fancy place, [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMxJT88P7Ew&t=129.0s)]
*  you know, just kind of faint, just just I mean, just damn look [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMxJT88P7Ew&t=135.0s)]
*  like we're on the Titanic, you know, I was just waiting for the [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMxJT88P7Ew&t=139.0s)]
*  whole restaurant to just fill up with water. That's how nice I [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMxJT88P7Ew&t=142.0s)]
*  mean, people just good day, you know, no people just being, you [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMxJT88P7Ew&t=147.0s)]
*  know, friendly, nobody yelling the N word, nobody doing nothing, [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMxJT88P7Ew&t=151.0s)]
*  just a good place, you know. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMxJT88P7Ew&t=155.0s)]
*  And, um, and. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMxJT88P7Ew&t=158.0s)]
*  And we went and we were sitting by, I was sitting, I guess, by [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMxJT88P7Ew&t=163.0s)]
*  this couple, and I think it was like a first date or something, [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMxJT88P7Ew&t=167.0s)]
*  or maybe second date. And this lady had these bangers, baby. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMxJT88P7Ew&t=169.0s)]
*  She had these damn front honeys on her, baby. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMxJT88P7Ew&t=174.0s)]
*  I mean, like a couple of damn freaking milk bears. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMxJT88P7Ew&t=177.0s)]
*  And they were just getting ready for spring. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMxJT88P7Ew&t=180.0s)]
*  You could see him just kind of, um, she had kind of a revealing [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMxJT88P7Ew&t=183.0s)]
*  kind of top on and you could see these big white damn just a couple [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMxJT88P7Ew&t=187.0s)]
*  of Moby dicks. You know what I'm saying? [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMxJT88P7Ew&t=192.0s)]
*  And she had on like a lot of powder, kind of different powder, you [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMxJT88P7Ew&t=195.0s)]
*  know, maybe body powder or something. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMxJT88P7Ew&t=198.0s)]
*  And she probably put about probably a half ounce up between them, [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMxJT88P7Ew&t=201.0s)]
*  you know, between them, between them, uh, them premier bunnies, baby, [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMxJT88P7Ew&t=205.0s)]
*  between them, you know, them hammer time front yams, baby. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMxJT88P7Ew&t=211.0s)]
*  She'd really, she put a lot of powder. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMxJT88P7Ew&t=215.0s)]
*  So anyway, some guy, this guy, she's on a date with is making her laugh. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMxJT88P7Ew&t=216.0s)]
*  He's telling her jokes and they were the worst jokes, right? [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMxJT88P7Ew&t=220.0s)]
*  They were like, just, uh, what was one? [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMxJT88P7Ew&t=224.0s)]
*  It was like, what's, um, oh, what's the tallest building in the world? [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMxJT88P7Ew&t=228.0s)]
*  And it was like, oh, it's, uh, it's a library because it has so many [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMxJT88P7Ew&t=234.0s)]
*  stories. That's what he would say. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMxJT88P7Ew&t=241.0s)]
*  And she would just die laughing, right? [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMxJT88P7Ew&t=243.0s)]
*  And I was kind of jealous she was having such a good time. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMxJT88P7Ew&t=246.0s)]
*  But when she would laugh, then her chest would kind of juggle and just [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMxJT88P7Ew&t=249.0s)]
*  that powder would just, I mean, just buffing up, just mufflering up out [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMxJT88P7Ew&t=254.0s)]
*  of them, um, out of them big nodules, baby. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMxJT88P7Ew&t=265.0s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMxJT88P7Ew&t=269.0s)]
*  Out of them big, uh, out of them big yogurt wagons, dude, just that [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMxJT88P7Ew&t=270.0s)]
*  powder would just like, um, it was like, it was like her tits were vaping [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMxJT88P7Ew&t=274.0s)]
*  or something, you know, it was like her, it was like her breasts were like [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMxJT88P7Ew&t=279.0s)]
*  hitting that thing of blue ice or whatever. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMxJT88P7Ew&t=282.0s)]
*  I mean, it was just, and it was, and so then it was, it kind of stopped [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMxJT88P7Ew&t=284.0s)]
*  and then he would tell another one. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMxJT88P7Ew&t=288.0s)]
*  And it was, I mean, just like, it was like Erin Brockovich was going to [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMxJT88P7Ew&t=292.0s)]
*  show up or something, you know, it just had that. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMxJT88P7Ew&t=296.0s)]
*  You almost wanted to call the city. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMxJT88P7Ew&t=298.0s)]
*  I mean, it just got real smoky over there. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMxJT88P7Ew&t=300.0s)]
*  Um, but yeah, that was something that happened at dinner. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMxJT88P7Ew&t=302.0s)]
*  We went with this one gal. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMxJT88P7Ew&t=308.0s)]
*  She had curled her hair so tight. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMxJT88P7Ew&t=310.0s)]
*  I mean, you ever have somebody that curl her hair just so tight? [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMxJT88P7Ew&t=311.0s)]
*  I mean, just tight, tight. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMxJT88P7Ew&t=314.0s)]
*  She couldn't even get her eyes. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMxJT88P7Ew&t=317.0s)]
*  I mean, I saw her every now and then just kind of getting some water out [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMxJT88P7Ew&t=318.0s)]
*  of glass and rubbing it on her eyes because she had just tightened that [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMxJT88P7Ew&t=320.0s)]
*  hair. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMxJT88P7Ew&t=324.0s)]
*  She'd locked it. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMxJT88P7Ew&t=325.0s)]
*  She's so locked open. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMxJT88P7Ew&t=326.0s)]
*  You know, I almost wanted to just undo a couple of the curls so she could, [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMxJT88P7Ew&t=327.0s)]
*  uh, you know, get half a blink in, baby. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMxJT88P7Ew&t=332.0s)]
*  She was real tightened up. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMxJT88P7Ew&t=335.0s)]
*  Um, but anyway, I was grateful to be eating and, uh, I, um, I wasn't even [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMxJT88P7Ew&t=337.0s)]
*  going to do an episode, but I really, I decided, uh, that I wanted to be [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMxJT88P7Ew&t=347.0s)]
*  here with you guys. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMxJT88P7Ew&t=352.0s)]
*  I wanted to be here with you. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMxJT88P7Ew&t=354.0s)]
*  I, um, I wanted to be here with you. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMxJT88P7Ew&t=356.0s)]
*  You know, I want to thank everybody who ventured out this week. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMxJT88P7Ew&t=360.0s)]
*  Uh, it was, we, we had a couple of different shows. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMxJT88P7Ew&t=364.0s)]
*  We started and did a small one nighter over in Lexington and then we hopped [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMxJT88P7Ew&t=368.0s)]
*  over to, um, where was it? [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMxJT88P7Ew&t=373.0s)]
*  Then we hopped over to Lafayette, Indiana, and we actually had a call that [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMxJT88P7Ew&t=377.0s)]

*  It was, uh, you know, it's the kind of summer that you get when you're [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMxJT88P7Ew&t=485.0s)]
*  It was, uh, you know, it's the kind of something you send your spouse to the [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMxJT88P7Ew&t=489.0s)]
*  store, you know, if you want, if you don't want them, you know, Hey, Judy, [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMxJT88P7Ew&t=493.0s)]

*  Yeah. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMxJT88P7Ew&t=513.0s)]
*  It was just an inclement weather, man. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMxJT88P7Ew&t=514.0s)]
*  So it was, it was quite a time, man. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMxJT88P7Ew&t=515.0s)]
*  We, you know, it was a great week of shows overall. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMxJT88P7Ew&t=517.0s)]
*  Um, some were when we got to Chicago, it got real fired up, man. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMxJT88P7Ew&t=520.0s)]
*  That's when that that crowd was electric. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMxJT88P7Ew&t=525.0s)]
*  Uh, I thought the crowds at Lafayette and at Rockford, which was the next night. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMxJT88P7Ew&t=528.0s)]
*  Um, they weren't just, it was just a little bit more of a sedate vibe. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMxJT88P7Ew&t=534.0s)]
*  Honestly, it just felt a little more sedate in there. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMxJT88P7Ew&t=539.0s)]
*  Uh, but a lot of great folks, everybody I met was great. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMxJT88P7Ew&t=543.0s)]
*  A couple of nice gifts I got. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMxJT88P7Ew&t=548.0s)]
*  Somebody brought me this into the wild book. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMxJT88P7Ew&t=550.0s)]
*  Um, this John Cracker Cracker got that hitter right here, baby. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMxJT88P7Ew&t=553.0s)]
*  That little lit hitter from Nicole gave me this. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMxJT88P7Ew&t=560.0s)]
*  Another man gave me an Elon Musk book. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMxJT88P7Ew&t=564.0s)]
*  Somebody. Oh, this was the roughest, bro. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMxJT88P7Ew&t=567.0s)]
*  So somebody sent me a, um, somebody sent me flowers and a chocolate, you know? [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMxJT88P7Ew&t=571.0s)]
*  And I got backstage and the shower was cold. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMxJT88P7Ew&t=579.0s)]
*  That was, oh, that was another thing in, uh, in Lafayette, which is where Purdue, Indiana is. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMxJT88P7Ew&t=582.0s)]
*  The Boilermakers, Engineering Town, and these batches don't even have a damn water heater. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMxJT88P7Ew&t=590.0s)]
*  And it was cold in there. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMxJT88P7Ew&t=598.0s)]
*  Dude, I had a shower. It was so cold. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMxJT88P7Ew&t=600.0s)]
*  Bro, I could feel, dude, I could feel my, I could, it felt like that movie Ice Age was playing in my ass, bro. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMxJT88P7Ew&t=604.0s)]
*  On six screens, dude, it felt like, oh, man. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMxJT88P7Ew&t=614.0s)]
*  It felt like a damn wooly man was running around in my dick. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMxJT88P7Ew&t=619.0s)]
*  You know what I'm saying, bro? It was, it was. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMxJT88P7Ew&t=626.0s)]
*  There was no hot water in the thing. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMxJT88P7Ew&t=628.0s)]
*  So I got in that shower, bro, and that almost killed me, man. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMxJT88P7Ew&t=630.0s)]
*  That almost shook me down, baby. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMxJT88P7Ew&t=634.0s)]
*  That almost didn't get out that shower. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMxJT88P7Ew&t=637.0s)]
*  Almost didn't get out that shower. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMxJT88P7Ew&t=641.0s)]
*  But anyway, somebody sent the chocolates. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMxJT88P7Ew&t=643.0s)]
*  There was a note on top that said, I can't wait for you to meet my son, your son. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMxJT88P7Ew&t=645.0s)]
*  I can't wait for you to meet your son. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMxJT88P7Ew&t=649.0s)]
*  And at first I'm looking at your son. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMxJT88P7Ew&t=651.0s)]
*  And I thought, you know, I thought your son was like an Asian name, you know? [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMxJT88P7Ew&t=654.0s)]
*  I didn't, so like, who's your son? [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMxJT88P7Ew&t=660.0s)]
*  You know, I didn't know if it was like a Japanese guy or whatever. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMxJT88P7Ew&t=665.0s)]
*  So I'm just thinking, who's your son? [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMxJT88P7Ew&t=667.0s)]
*  I can't wait for you to meet your son. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMxJT88P7Ew&t=670.0s)]
*  And then I'm like, oh, my God, your son. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMxJT88P7Ew&t=673.0s)]
*  Then my head goes, oh, my God. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMxJT88P7Ew&t=679.0s)]
*  Because this has always been a fear of mine. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMxJT88P7Ew&t=682.0s)]
*  You know, I've had my penis and nuts a long time. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMxJT88P7Ew&t=685.0s)]
*  And I've always expected that this could be a reality. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMxJT88P7Ew&t=689.0s)]
*  Somebody drops off that tall bambino, you know, they put him in a basket. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMxJT88P7Ew&t=694.0s)]
*  He's 14, but he's just in a basket on your doorstep. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMxJT88P7Ew&t=698.0s)]
*  You know, it's that teenage Easter all of a sudden for you right there. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMxJT88P7Ew&t=701.0s)]
*  And here was the crazy part. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMxJT88P7Ew&t=706.0s)]
*  Then I look over, my tour manager standing there, Tim Bissell, he's standing over there and he's dying. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMxJT88P7Ew&t=708.0s)]
*  He's dying, bro, because he saw the look on my face. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMxJT88P7Ew&t=716.0s)]
*  I was like, holy shit, somebody brought my son. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMxJT88P7Ew&t=719.0s)]
*  And this was the wild part. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMxJT88P7Ew&t=724.0s)]
*  Then I went through like, oh, my God, thank God. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMxJT88P7Ew&t=727.0s)]
*  Then I had a moment where I was like, oh, damn, bro. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMxJT88P7Ew&t=731.0s)]
*  I wanted to meet my son, dude. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMxJT88P7Ew&t=735.0s)]
*  Part of me was bummed that I didn't get to meet this son, you know, this alleged possible son. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMxJT88P7Ew&t=738.0s)]
*  So that was that was pretty that was that was quite a moment. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMxJT88P7Ew&t=743.0s)]
*  And then somebody brought this little baby dragon head or something. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMxJT88P7Ew&t=747.0s)]
*  And they approached the stage with it in Chicago. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMxJT88P7Ew&t=751.0s)]
*  And that was a little that was a little strange. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMxJT88P7Ew&t=753.0s)]
*  Just looks like a damn senior citizen, like the last look like before they take that last bite of like a. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMxJT88P7Ew&t=755.0s)]
*  Maybe a little cake or something. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMxJT88P7Ew&t=763.0s)]
*  If you got a grandfather or something like that, that's OK. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMxJT88P7Ew&t=765.0s)]
*  Maybe like a skunk got poisoned or something. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMxJT88P7Ew&t=769.0s)]
*  But anyway, some nice gifts. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMxJT88P7Ew&t=773.0s)]
*  Thank you, guys, who brought things. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMxJT88P7Ew&t=775.0s)]
*  What's going on, man? [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMxJT88P7Ew&t=778.0s)]
*  Oh, the news. I see this. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMxJT88P7Ew&t=780.0s)]
*  They had a lawsuit against Dennis Perkins and the Livingston Parish School System alleges Cynthia Perkins. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMxJT88P7Ew&t=783.0s)]
*  They supplied semen in the cupcakes. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMxJT88P7Ew&t=792.0s)]
*  And that makes you. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMxJT88P7Ew&t=797.0s)]
*  I mean, that just. Oh. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMxJT88P7Ew&t=800.0s)]
*  That's like damn wiener fentanyl. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMxJT88P7Ew&t=804.0s)]
*  If that's in a fifth, if that's in a baked good, that's you know. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMxJT88P7Ew&t=806.0s)]
*  You just don't want that in there, baby. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMxJT88P7Ew&t=809.0s)]
*  You know, and it's just. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMxJT88P7Ew&t=813.0s)]
*  I guess that's where we're at. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMxJT88P7Ew&t=816.0s)]
*  Is this I mean, it's that maybe people are starving. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMxJT88P7Ew&t=817.0s)]
*  I don't know what's going on. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMxJT88P7Ew&t=820.0s)]
*  You know, I read grapes are wrath and. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMxJT88P7Ew&t=823.0s)]
*  And at a certain point, things get so bad, they're breastfeeding each other. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMxJT88P7Ew&t=827.0s)]
*  But I can't imagine even in Livingston Parish, Louisiana. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMxJT88P7Ew&t=832.0s)]
*  They put it in pastries, it says here, and energy drinks. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMxJT88P7Ew&t=838.0s)]
*  Damn. Well, look. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMxJT88P7Ew&t=842.0s)]
*  The energy, you could argue the energy drink part, but you can't mean. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMxJT88P7Ew&t=846.0s)]
*  You can't put a look, you know. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMxJT88P7Ew&t=851.0s)]
*  You can't put more. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMxJT88P7Ew&t=854.0s)]
*  You can't put more. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMxJT88P7Ew&t=857.0s)]
*  You can't. You can't be doing that. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMxJT88P7Ew&t=859.0s)]
*  You can't be. You can't be doing that on the eclair, bro. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMxJT88P7Ew&t=862.0s)]
*  You can't put more doodle in a snicker, bro. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMxJT88P7Ew&t=865.0s)]
*  You know what I'm saying, dude? What else? [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMxJT88P7Ew&t=868.0s)]
*  I'm not going to make this a real long episode today. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMxJT88P7Ew&t=870.0s)]
*  I'm going to keep it pretty chill. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMxJT88P7Ew&t=873.0s)]
*  I'm feeling a little under the weather. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMxJT88P7Ew&t=875.0s)]
*  I got kind of sick actually in Lafayette. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMxJT88P7Ew&t=876.0s)]
*  I got that day I started having me a fever and so I wasn't feeling real well. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMxJT88P7Ew&t=878.0s)]
*  And here's another call actually that came in from there. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMxJT88P7Ew&t=882.0s)]

*  Then we left and I took her home. [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMxJT88P7Ew&t=1474.0s)]
*  And did you try to advance it at some point? [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMxJT88P7Ew&t=1475.0s)]
*  Did you say, you know, did you let her know what was going on like with you or how did [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMxJT88P7Ew&t=1476.0s)]

*  And you breathe in a lot of the same air. [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMxJT88P7Ew&t=2132.0s)]
*  So you can't get a lot of new ideas. [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMxJT88P7Ew&t=2134.0s)]
*  Because your air has the same it's coming to your body and going out. [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMxJT88P7Ew&t=2137.0s)]
*  So you basically just huffing the same bullshit that's been in your brain. [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMxJT88P7Ew&t=2141.0s)]
*  Because I mean, you know, if you if you have something, an idea in your body and in your head and you breathe out, it's part of it's in the air. [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMxJT88P7Ew&t=2144.0s)]
*  You breathe it back in and you just sit in there. [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMxJT88P7Ew&t=2155.0s)]
*  You basically just you just hot hose hitting your own frickin poor choices sometimes at some point. [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMxJT88P7Ew&t=2159.0s)]
*  But I wanted to I wanted to come and be here with you guys. [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMxJT88P7Ew&t=2167.0s)]
*  I wanted to take a couple of calls and see what was going on in you guys's world as well. [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMxJT88P7Ew&t=2172.0s)]
*  What do we got right here? [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMxJT88P7Ew&t=2179.0s)]
*  Hey, Theo, it is just from California and I'm not sure if ladies are allowed to call in. [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMxJT88P7Ew&t=2183.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah. Ladies, welcome. Ladies, welcome. Thank you. [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMxJT88P7Ew&t=2190.0s)]
*  I don't hear a lot of that. [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMxJT88P7Ew&t=2194.0s)]
*  Anyhow, I just want to say I'm really taken by the last episode, the episode you had solo talking about ayahuasca and therapy and all that. [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMxJT88P7Ew&t=2197.0s)]
*  I went to Peru myself and the way you articulated it was perfect. [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMxJT88P7Ew&t=2208.0s)]
*  Like giving your like God giving the secrets away or giving your heart a chance to talk was really beautiful and spot on. [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMxJT88P7Ew&t=2215.0s)]
*  Thank you very much. Yeah, it's like your it's like your heart gets a brain in it. [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMxJT88P7Ew&t=2223.0s)]
*  It's like your soul gets to fart kind of. [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMxJT88P7Ew&t=2229.0s)]
*  It's it's unbelievable. I just got back from another experience with it and I'm going to talk about that a lot. [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMxJT88P7Ew&t=2234.0s)]
*  I'm not really ready to yet. I don't think I just I don't want to talk about it in our when I feel like I'm on kind of when I'm I just want to feel a little more settled. [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMxJT88P7Ew&t=2240.0s)]
*  This week has been just a ride. And last weekend is when I did ayahuasca the second time. [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMxJT88P7Ew&t=2250.0s)]
*  So this has been just a and then I went right into the touring. So it's just been a wild week. Let's hear more. [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMxJT88P7Ew&t=2256.0s)]
*  And reminded me how much I need to get back to it because I don't think it's a one shot deal. [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMxJT88P7Ew&t=2262.0s)]
*  And just thank you for your vulnerability because you show a good example to men on how to be vulnerable. [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMxJT88P7Ew&t=2270.0s)]
*  I know you probably don't think that way with what you're struggling with, but it is good to have an example to the masculine about how it looks and what it looks like to be in touch with yourself. [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMxJT88P7Ew&t=2277.0s)]
*  And not to be scared of that. So you're doing great. And I thank you for your vulnerability. [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMxJT88P7Ew&t=2290.0s)]
*  And you'll see your own Los Angeles. I live in video. It doesn't matter. OK, well, thank you again. [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMxJT88P7Ew&t=2297.0s)]
*  Shooter shoot, baby. I love you, young lady. Thank you for the call. [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMxJT88P7Ew&t=2303.0s)]
*  Yeah, you know, I don't really have any other choice, I don't think. But to be where I'm at in my life. [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMxJT88P7Ew&t=2310.0s)]
*  And it is hard. Sometimes I feel, you know, I feel like a little bitch, honestly, in some ways. I know that's just a term, right? [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMxJT88P7Ew&t=2317.0s)]
*  But I didn't have I need, you know, I think part of me, I grew a little I grew a little bitch in me because I didn't have that motherly love I needed. [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMxJT88P7Ew&t=2328.0s)]
*  So part of me probably sprouted a bitch inside of me. Because I needed that. [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMxJT88P7Ew&t=2337.0s)]
*  I needed that. It's amazing what you will create, what you will create inside of yourself when you need it. [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMxJT88P7Ew&t=2342.0s)]
*  So. But anyway, thanks for the words. Yeah, I'm just I don't know. I'm just trying to be alive and and yeah, I just I don't know. [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMxJT88P7Ew&t=2351.0s)]
*  The ayahuasca experience has been it's been really amazing. I don't know if it's. [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMxJT88P7Ew&t=2364.0s)]
*  I don't know. I have a lot of thoughts on it. I'll get into it at a different time, maybe next week when it just hasn't been such a jump. [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMxJT88P7Ew&t=2371.0s)]
*  Just it just hasn't been such a time. This has been a long little stretch. I feel rattled right now, kind of all over the place. [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMxJT88P7Ew&t=2380.0s)]
*  I'm trying to make it down to Mardi Gras to spend some time with my family in Louisiana. [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMxJT88P7Ew&t=2389.0s)]
*  You know, I miss I miss. My hometown, some and I miss my family some. [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMxJT88P7Ew&t=2398.0s)]
*  And yeah, I don't know. I really just I don't know. [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMxJT88P7Ew&t=2408.0s)]
*  I miss being around people that I know really care about me and who I care about. [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMxJT88P7Ew&t=2412.0s)]
*  So I'm a go. I hope to spend some time doing a little bit of that this week. [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMxJT88P7Ew&t=2419.0s)]
*  So what else? What else do we have? Do you have any regrets about the lady rally? [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMxJT88P7Ew&t=2423.0s)]
*  I don't. Do you do you feel like she was into you? Do you feel like what do you feel like? [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMxJT88P7Ew&t=2434.0s)]
*  Yeah, I felt like she was into me. Did you do something that sent her away? [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMxJT88P7Ew&t=2443.0s)]
*  Do you feel like there was a false move you made? No, I didn't. [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMxJT88P7Ew&t=2448.0s)]
