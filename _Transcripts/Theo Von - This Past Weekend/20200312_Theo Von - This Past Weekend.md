# TJ Miller  This Past Weekend w Theo Von #266
**Theo Von - This Past Weekend:** [March 12, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY)
*  Today's episode is brought to you by Grey Block Pizza. If you were wondering if [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=0.0s)]
*  you can have something in your mouth that feels like it's from another country [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=5.4s)]
*  you can. Italy. And that is pizza. Grey Block Pizza. 1811 Pico Boulevard on the [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=8.64s)]
*  way to the beach. Grey Block. Get that header. Today's guest is a he's a film [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=15.58s)]
*  man and he's a comedian and honestly I don't even really know him that well so [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=23.16s)]
*  I'm gonna get to know him as you do but I do know that he is the star of the [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=28.34s)]
*  Emoji movie TJ Miller [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=33.3s)]
*  Yeah it is you know and I just sometimes I like to have something sometimes I wear [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=58.34s)]
*  some glasses that don't have any lenses or just something I don't really like [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=64.52000000000001s)]
*  interviewing so it makes me feel or not interviewing but I sometimes I'm just [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=68.32000000000001s)]
*  not it's not really my strongest suit. Do you think? Yeah. Well one of the things is [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=71.74000000000001s)]
*  you riff on your own and with the voicemails and stuff like that so yeah [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=77.64s)]
*  you know it's and it's that's closer to stand-up right then doing an interview [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=82.7s)]
*  and then I find that other people are almost more comfortable interviewing like [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=88.25999999999999s)]
*  that's one thing that I've thought is really interesting about I mean the joke [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=92.78s)]
*  with Mark Merrin's podcast was always like fast-forward through his part and [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=96.33999999999999s)]
*  get to the interview because he's such a good interviewer yeah and then Joe Rogan [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=99.61999999999999s)]
*  I think has slowly become more about the interview and being the interviewer than [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=103.69999999999999s)]
*  about it being comedic at all or anything like that. Yeah he's yeah he's [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=109.25999999999999s)]
*  not usually he's not very comedic or with some guests he is and some guests [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=112.94s)]
*  he isn't yeah. But I think you do interviews really well but that's [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=116.26s)]
*  interesting that you don't feel necessarily comfortable doing that [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=119.78s)]
*  because we were just talking about I have this show called Gore Burger where [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=123.46000000000001s)]
*  it's a giant blue alien puppet that interviews people and that was on Comedy [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=127.42s)]
*  Central and there's a lot of it on YouTube and that I felt really good and [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=131.38s)]
*  I'm I was interested in interviewing it and he did Gore Burger did Snoop Dogg's [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=136.82s)]
*  GGN Network and it was just and it's a real burger it's a fake burger but it's [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=141.78s)]
*  a no it's like oh there it is that's it oh wow yeah he's and so it's a giant [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=147.46s)]
*  puppet and there's somebody else in the puppet is it you but I'm so I'm [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=152.94s)]
*  controlling his mouth using a radio controller and two other puppeteers are [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=157.86s)]
*  doing his eyes and sort of facial expressions and so it's a lot like Joe [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=162.9s)]
*  Biden you mean a little that's a little bit less I think well that's [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=167.28s)]
*  incredible looking it's great and so I do with these two guys the director [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=174.84s)]
*  brothers and it's a it feels a lot more comfortable for me kind of what you're [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=178.56s)]
*  saying to interview somebody through the character because he's our talks like [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=183.56s)]
*  this and he doesn't really know anything about human beings and so he has kind of [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=187.96s)]
*  questions about what it's like to be a human yeah so the questions can kind of [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=192.36s)]
*  come from that angle instead of necessarily being you know TJ Miller [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=196.12s)]
*  asking questions yeah so yeah I really really like that and then my podcast [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=201.08s)]
*  cashing in with TJ Miller is the conceit is that cash levy he's a comedian and an [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=205.76000000000002s)]
*  improviser friend of mine and I tour with he has an interview show but he can [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=212.8s)]
*  never get another guest so I've been his only guest for like six years now oh [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=217.72000000000003s)]
*  really so it's just you interview him every time yeah every single time but [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=222.84s)]
*  it's it's more absurdist and it's kind of you know the interviews aren't about [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=227.56s)]
*  you know what's what are you up to what's going on with you it's more stuff [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=231.52s)]
*  like you know we have a thing where it's like if you attach a handle to anything [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=236.20000000000002s)]
*  does it become a ladle like if you put a hand on this does immediately become a [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=241.0s)]
*  ladle like a mitten like right a mitten would be a ladle that's exactly right [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=245.68s)]
*  that would be a better is that a better ladle than a glove mmm or can you use [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=250.0s)]
*  each of the fingers for the separate things that you want to ladle I think [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=255.24s)]
*  glove probably be better because a mitten is gonna have too much liquid he [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=258.52s)]
*  could get out of a mitten yeah I've got to run water across the house and a [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=261.92s)]
*  mitten when I was young and it's it's anti-climactic I'd love to know what the context of that is [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=265.44s)]
*  just not having a cup yes you just got to get that water one way or another [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=270.28s)]
*  the other side of kids when you're being fat yeah yeah it doesn't matter well um [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=273.84s)]
*  can you relate you think to that and like do you feel like you sometimes like [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=278.6s)]
*  because I feel like you to me like we don't know each other that well yeah I [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=282.16s)]
*  know we kind of have crossed paths mostly through stand-up yeah yeah do you feel [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=286.32s)]
*  like and you always seem to me like um like always some of the time with you [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=291.12s)]
*  always because I always felt like there was like a fire alarm going off or [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=298.36s)]
*  something sometimes like I get that's the same kind of feeling I get sometimes [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=302.4s)]
*  like me yeah not from you or that's around you know but I like somebody behind [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=306.52s)]
*  your something pulled a fire alarm or maybe even you just pulled it on your own [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=311.59999999999997s)]
*  back and it's just like there's like there is that energy I've never heard [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=314.68s)]
*  anything even close to that but that's pretty right on and sometimes it's the [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=318.47999999999996s)]
*  energy of me coming in I live in New York now so and in in Manhattan I do and [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=322.47999999999996s)]
*  it's a much better speed for me because all all the village right yeah in Grinch [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=328.32s)]
*  Village and then I'll zip around to do three four five sets in a night and that [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=333.03999999999996s)]
*  is a better energy for me to just like run from the subway to the club go right [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=339.2s)]
*  up do the set leave like get paid talk to the people then leave run to the [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=343.23999999999995s)]
*  subway get on the subway get out of the go to a different that's kind of I feel [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=347.76s)]
*  more comfortable in that energy and I think that was always a problem for me [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=351.71999999999997s)]
*  in Los Angeles was that I had that energy but here it's a lot more laid back [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=355.44s)]
*  not just that Cali attitude but also you know you do one show in a night maybe two [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=360.32s)]
*  shows and if you're gonna do two it's like a spot at the improv and you'll [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=365.79999999999995s)]
*  make your way up to the laugh factory so there's no rush there's no hurry there's [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=370.15999999999997s)]
*  no no hurry energy like that and then it's more hype than hustle it's more [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=373.67999999999995s)]
*  hype than hustle there's not it's a good point that's no hustle energy yeah and [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=378.67999999999995s)]
*  so the hustle energy but that also works when you do film and television [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=382.71999999999997s)]
*  especially television because they are moving quickly they need every you know [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=386.68s)]
*  minute cost this amount of money and so they appreciate that I'm like alright [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=391.08s)]
*  let's go let's go and then I just riff like three you know five six lines okay [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=395.15999999999997s)]
*  is that good let's do it alright let's get the cameras in a different position [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=399.52s)]
*  and you have moments of chilling and and relaxing on a film set and sometimes [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=402.03999999999996s)]
*  people say it's a lot of waiting but as soon as the knock comes on the trailer [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=409.2s)]
*  you got to quickly get into it and go and they need you on set right away and [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=413.6s)]
*  you go in front of the camera and then boom you got to go but do you feel like [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=417.4s)]
*  like I felt like and I get I don't know I hope I'm not being there's no but I've [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=422.0s)]
*  always felt like you're like it you remind me of like a character like you [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=425.84s)]
*  remind me of like a feels a little judgmental doesn't know I think that's [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=429.32s)]
*  right I mean here you ever feel like that now here's here's this sort of [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=434.15999999999997s)]

*  is going on inside of this dude like this guy brought his own moons you know [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=448.52s)]
*  ten guys doing his own thing but there's you know I think my character would be [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=453.44s)]

*  heart no it's it's a brain condition where there's a malformation your brain [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=732.8000000000001s)]
*  in this case who's in my frontal lobe and because the brain so amazing the [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=737.2800000000001s)]
*  elasticity of it allows it to sort of figure out how to act as a normal human [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=741.5799999999999s)]
*  being but with less brain matter and what we found because I have like a team [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=747.4599999999999s)]
*  of doctors that sort of monitor me and have since 2010 because I have a I had [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=754.3399999999999s)]
*  the AVM hemorrhaged and I had to go and get it removed so I have a golf ball [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=760.0999999999999s)]
*  size piece of my brain that they took out so right in my frontal lobe there's [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=764.78s)]
*  like you know your brain is whole and so what I think happened was I have less [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=769.34s)]
*  frontal lobe than other people so it has to work double time so I take a lot of [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=775.5s)]
*  medication both to prevent seizures and then one of the medications is to prevent [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=779.66s)]
*  seizures it has seizure preventative like components to it but it's also to [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=783.98s)]
*  control mania and I'm prone to manic episodes so I'm not bipolar I'm not like [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=789.78s)]
*  I get depressed and then I but I am prone to manic episodes if I lapse in the and [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=794.74s)]
*  those manic episodes are like your brain just is moving so quickly and you don't [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=800.18s)]
*  know you're in a manic episode anything oh well this must be this and it [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=804.18s)]
*  connects to this and this is and so sometimes I think that that may have [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=807.26s)]
*  contributed a little bit in addition to how hard I worked in my work ethic with [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=812.1s)]
*  that's a bad mix yeah yeah just not your work ethic but when you have to work [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=816.74s)]
*  really hard and you have some mental uncomfort going on and it's getting [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=820.4599999999999s)]
*  heavy it's mixes scary isn't it yeah and it can also just be a lot of can just [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=824.02s)]
*  be a go-go-go mentality but I wonder do I have that level of work ethic because [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=829.14s)]
*  I'm manic or does working that hard sort of egg on the mania but I do really well [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=834.74s)]
*  especially on the medication it's just that you know that manic energy I think [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=843.02s)]
*  in some ways I would want to take a dose right now if you hey you know I'm saying [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=849.06s)]
*  there were times where I would take a dose of that if you had it yeah to right [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=852.56s)]
*  because you have so much going on yeah I'd want a little manic energy oh see [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=856.0s)]
*  this so this is the opposite so the medication kind of pulls pulls that you [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=859.56s)]
*  ever monitor the medicine just to see okay maybe I'll take you know do five [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=863.36s)]
*  less million so I can do what I do the only no no because I can do what I can [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=867.02s)]
*  do on the medication okay it's that if I start to get manic then I'll take it [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=870.4s)]
*  more of it I see it's almost like a and wow man I think for a long time and now I [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=874.6s)]

*  sounded like but he also could have been eavesdropping from some I have [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=1132.6s)]
*  never intended on starting an ice cream parlor but I definitely would have said [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=1136.32s)]
*  something like that yeah I think that the problem is I don't I'm I'm not as [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=1141.04s)]
*  aware of my surroundings I'm just aware of like what is the mission statement [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=1147.36s)]
*  what are we trying to do or how are we having fun so it's not really so you so [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=1152.0s)]
*  it's not like a thing you're putting on it's just that's who you are no and I [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=1155.9599999999998s)]
*  think it's even something that's even more like in your system if you have I [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=1159.52s)]
*  mean that's wild bro if it's that way I'm low I can't even imagine that it's [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=1164.88s)]
*  pretty crazy and I never even noticed anything about it or thought anything of [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=1168.76s)]
*  it until it becomes sort of like a medical emergency because that I did a [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=1172.52s)]
*  bit about it on this is not happening but that surgery they came in and they [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=1176.92s)]
*  go so this is a pretty serious like surgery and I was like yeah I assume [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=1183.24s)]
*  you're opening up my fucking head and and they sort of were like so about it's a [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=1187.56s)]
*  10% fatality rate so about one in ten people who get this surgery done die and [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=1196.72s)]
*  I was like okay what happens if I don't get the surgery because it was elective [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=1201.4s)]
*  he said you don't have to get it so this is one out of ten people die or you don't [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=1206.04s)]
*  you don't have to get it I said well what happens if you don't get it and he [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=1211.88s)]
*  was like hmm you probably die in your mid-30s and I was like let's roll the [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=1215.82s)]
*  dice and get this surgery done right one out of ten ain't bad my opinion [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=1220.24s)]
*  that's some Dungeons and Dragons shit right there that's the ten sided die and [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=1227.3s)]
*  so you know I take away your hit point you think after you got it like is there [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=1232.5s)]
*  times where you can feel an idea kind of going and then there's just like oh so [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=1239.08s)]
*  that's a great point so what I said was I said you know I said so the the main [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=1242.3799999999999s)]
*  thing I want to ask you is why still be funny after the operation and the guy [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=1249.82s)]
*  was like what and I said like if I get the operation will I still be funny [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=1253.54s)]
*  because that's my work I'm a comedian he goes I mean does it he almost like does [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=1257.86s)]
*  it matter don't you want to like live and not have a brain hemorrhage and he [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=1263.3s)]
*  said I mean I assume so I don't you know you're not using that part of your brain [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=1268.02s)]
*  now it was malformed in the womb so when we remove it we're not removing any of [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=1272.78s)]
*  your like cognitive efficiencies you're not cognitively deficient right now so [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=1277.82s)]
*  we wouldn't see why taking out a part of your brain that you don't use would so [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=1283.18s)]
*  because I think so I said because if it's not gonna make me funny kind of [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=1286.6200000000001s)]
*  almost rather do the maybe die in your mid-30s thing and that floored the whole [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=1291.04s)]
*  room all of the doctors were like that doesn't seem like something we'd ever [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=1296.78s)]
*  really hurt doesn't check out the yeah yeah cuz you know is that true when you [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=1301.54s)]
*  said that though did you really have course of course but I also have a very [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=1305.82s)]
*  interesting relationship with death both like philosophically and following some [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=1310.46s)]
*  philosophers specifically Epicurus which he has this great quote which is like [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=1316.18s)]
*  because people would have always come to him who were afraid of death which was [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=1320.22s)]
*  mostly actually in Greece noblemen and people of great wealth because they kind [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=1324.3s)]
*  of knew that all the church like stuff was bullshit but yeah that's a totally [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=1330.18s)]
*  I mean that's you know it's like Zeus and all that era of stuff but they would [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=1334.18s)]
*  be scared about it and so they would say you know I'm afraid of death and he would [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=1339.54s)]
*  say why and stuff too yeah you don't want to die if you have stuff right [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=1343.7s)]
*  exactly if you don't have anything you're like let's check out a little [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=1347.86s)]
*  see what's going on here yeah let's see what the next step is that's hilarious [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=1351.3400000000001s)]
*  maybe I'll get a car in heaven you know I take it the fucking bus here on earth [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=1356.26s)]
*  and so he says that when you are death is not and when death is you are not so [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=1360.5800000000002s)]
*  you really never cross paths with death so why would you even worry about it or [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=1370.6200000000001s)]
*  fear it because you'll never encounter it and so I was sitting that stuff like on [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=1375.1000000000001s)]
*  my own in high school and then kind of became an absurdist and sort of a nihilist [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=1380.54s)]
*  as I entered college definitely and yeah right feel it feel that yeah oh yeah if [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=1386.62s)]
*  other people are picking for the basketball team in PE and you're like [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=1392.62s)]
*  you know you and death never really meet each other you just kind of cross paths [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=1395.38s)]
*  yeah right exactly I'm quite that but I think I'm a guy that did so I did the [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=1399.14s)]
*  emoji movie in part because I like to entertain children I want those movies [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=1403.38s)]
*  to be funny so that the parents don't want to like beat themselves over the [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=1408.1399999999999s)]
*  head with a sledgehammer because they have to watch those movies all the time [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=1412.98s)]
*  if a kid likes a movie they're watching over and over and over yeah but I also [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=1415.46s)]
*  do excuse me I did that movie Yogi Bear 3d and I did Transformers and I did the [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=1418.86s)]
*  emotion movie because I won a funny credit for my stand-up so now when I get [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=1427.06s)]
*  introduced now you don't introduce me as like TJ Miller from Deadpool or Silicon [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=1432.62s)]
*  Valley it's you know young kids sometimes will come up to me and they'll [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=1437.34s)]
*  be like so so how do you want me to introduce you and you can tell they [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=1441.0s)]
*  kind of are like I want to get this right so let me just you know get really [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=1445.1999999999998s)]
*  clear because they're expecting me to say like well I'll just put do this and [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=1448.1399999999999s)]
*  this and this whatever that whatever people do there and and I'll be like [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=1451.6599999999999s)]
*  just the star of the emoji movie they're like but what do you what do you want me [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=1457.06s)]
*  to introduce is that what you want me to introduce yes and I'm like yeah and then [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=1463.9s)]
*  kind of fuck with him I'll go but I mean really hit star like the star of the [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=1467.38s)]
*  emoji movie okay and it's good to emphasize emoji also because that's what [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=1473.42s)]
*  the movie's about and you can hit movie also because it is a movie so just but [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=1477.7800000000002s)]

*  he kidding whatever but I always fit I always follow that up with like I [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=1491.04s)]
*  honestly don't give a shit clearly because I'm telling you the emoji movie [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=1494.48s)]
*  and so that's kind of how I approach life is like I'll do entire films sort [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=1497.12s)]
*  of for the service of the joke of the stand-up credit being that thing so [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=1503.76s)]
*  that's kind of my approach to life journals I really don't take it seriously [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=1508.72s)]
*  and people say don't take life seriously it's like no I really do not take any of [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=1511.36s)]
*  it seriously it's truly I'm an absurdist and it's really really fun but [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=1516.24s)]
*  so within the context of what you asked about the the doctors and is that true [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=1521.2s)]
*  that you I really was sort of saying if I can be who I am and continue to make [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=1527.6s)]
*  people laugh because that's what's important to me not to be famous not to [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=1533.36s)]
*  have people like me or laugh at like laugh at the things that I say but to [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=1536.68s)]
*  if I only have I forget how old I was then but it was like if I only have a [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=1542.2s)]
*  decade or so left to keep doing what I'm doing now and I'm feel so blessed to be [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=1547.2s)]

*  come back in we're feeling blessed in here blessed enough to try out T-Mobile's [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=1559.04s)]
*  national network hey Verizon is the only network that stream straight to the Lord [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=1562.96s)]

*  data and wishes also you don't get wishes in heaven that's a genie I don't [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=1586.76s)]
*  know where the fuck that came from dude it could be your heaven though it could [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=1591.08s)]
*  happen if you want it the wishes you can get to the wish in heaven the [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=1594.08s)]
*  unlimited data and wish in heaven so I but I yeah I think I was very very [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=1597.84s)]
*  deadly serious in fact that I would rather continue to make people happy and [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=1604.84s)]
*  do what I feel so lucky to be doing then kind of no longer be funny and just live [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=1611.04s)]
*  longer I just I've never understood why that is the goal to just live as long as [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=1617.56s)]
*  you can't it's not some race it's not the competition or anything like that so [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=1622.8s)]
*  you should really want to live you know 20 years more with purpose with sort of [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=1627.32s)]
*  reward with feeling in and of yourself with kind of self-efficacy and those [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=1634.48s)]
*  things rather than just go like 50 years to then retire and go on cruise ships [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=1639.76s)]
*  now if that's living purposefully I talk about this in my act a little bit if [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=1645.36s)]
*  living purposefully is understand that change from person to person if you know [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=1650.1599999999999s)]
*  I look at somebody who works at State Farm and I don't think like oh geez nine [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=1654.0s)]
*  to five two weeks of vacation and then you retire and go on Carnival cruises [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=1658.3999999999999s)]
*  and it's like no if that person is smart what they'll do is say I work in an [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=1663.1999999999998s)]
*  industry where I help people feel safer where when the inevitable happens it [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=1670.28s)]
*  doesn't cripple them financially I have a consistent job so I can consistently [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=1675.08s)]

*  would be good so just like people expect that they kind of know that I'm [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=3162.9s)]

*  about it's like he's a bounty hunter in this video game world he's obviously a [[00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=3257.58s)]
*  nerd because he plays video games non-stop all the time it's how he makes [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=3261.66s)]
*  his money everything I said well who would be his idol Boba Fett right I mean [[00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=3265.38s)]
*  obviously that's who we all love from Star Wars and this guy's actually a [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=3270.58s)]
*  bounty hunter so I just studied Boba Fett's he only has like five lines oh [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=3273.98s)]
*  wow just kind of cops of the cops some of that vibe yeah cop that vibe and then [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=3278.66s)]
*  went in and I was like all right I'm just gonna ask Steven Spielberg you know [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=3282.86s)]
*  does he think this is a good idea and if it's not then I'm just gonna say to him [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=3286.66s)]
*  what you know I'm open to anything else and just let him kind of direct you know [[00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=3289.98s)]

*  do you ever do you feel like that you're in control of yourself a lot of times or [[00:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=3455.1800000000003s)]
*  does it feel like almost uncontrollable it's very rare that I would feel like [[00:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=3459.42s)]
*  I'm out of control here with my thinking but it has happened I missed a day on [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=3464.42s)]
*  Silicon Valley because I had a manic episode that night and when I say manic [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=3468.9s)]
*  episode I mean I thought that there were birds flying by there were actually [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=3472.46s)]
*  drones and then which were probably bats and I thought I thought I really [[00:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=3476.58s)]
*  remember so vividly I was loading an internet page and it said visit China [[00:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=3482.42s)]
*  come see China China China China and then it changed so I thought for sure [[00:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=3486.14s)]
*  they were watching me through the I could have been real the camera I know [[00:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=3490.82s)]
*  for reals well that's right I went to Shanghai recently it's okay that's why [[00:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=3494.6600000000003s)]
*  in the main I don't think I'll ever go that's why in the main in the in the [[00:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=3498.54s)]
*  mania in the midst of a manic episode you of course you're like that could be [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=3504.3s)]
*  real but in mania you're like that's definitely real and so I smashed the [[00:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=3508.3s)]
*  computer and because I was afraid they were watching me through the and you get [[00:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=3511.86s)]
*  and all of this makes complete sense to you but I would say that's happened [[00:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=3515.98s)]
*  five or ten times in my entire life it's much more and we say sense of whimsy [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=3520.42s)]
*  whimsy the first thing I think of is Kate because Kate is really she talks [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=3526.5s)]
*  about that a lot she likes I love a sense of whimsy she likes things that are [[00:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=3530.38s)]
*  whimsical I think it's kind of I'm pretty carefree and it's really a positive [[00:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=3533.46s)]
*  nihilism it's like if none of this none of this means anything then then [[00:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=3540.98s)]
*  anything can mean everything that's sort of the positive nihilist viewpoint if [[00:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=3546.46s)]
*  nothing means anything then you decide what because anything can mean [[00:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=3551.26s)]
*  everything so for me it's making people laugh and doing that and that's why a [[00:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=3555.62s)]
*  nihilist true nihilist would never have a conversation with a religious person [[00:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=3560.06s)]
*  and be like there's no God there's you know what are you talking about none of [[00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=3567.34s)]
*  this means anything you wouldn't do that that's somebody who's like dogmatic and [[00:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=3571.86s)]
*  not truly a nihilist right that's the only one we're trying to push their [[00:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=3575.7s)]
*  agenda maybe yeah because if truly nothing means anything then who cares [[00:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=3578.2599999999998s)]
*  yeah there's a God but whatever even saying there's not a God doesn't mean [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=3583.62s)]
*  anything all that language is is totally meaningless right so and if you someone [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=3588.58s)]
*  believes it why take them to task if it's if it makes them feel comfortable [[00:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=3593.06s)]
*  or them feel good yeah and that's that is I think a beautiful thing in positive [[00:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=3597.2999999999997s)]
*  is this idea of you make your own meaning that's that's we all in effect [[01:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=3601.7s)]
*  have become that concept of God where you can completely make your life [[01:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=3606.58s)]
*  meaningful in any way shape or form again the state farm agent where it's [[01:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=3612.14s)]
*  like you can make meaning in that or you can take other people's meaning and feel [[01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=3615.62s)]
*  bad in which you had a better car and always want the next biggest television [[01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=3620.7s)]
*  all that stuff but then again is a positive nihilist I'm going but if [[01:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=3625.54s)]
*  wanting a bigger car is going to make you happy and having the net the next [[01:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=3630.06s)]
*  television in the next best television and that's really important to you and [[01:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=3635.1s)]
*  you work hard because of that then great that's the meaning that you've made right [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=3639.3s)]
*  and so you get it gets to a place like you were talking about acceptance you [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=3643.46s)]
*  get to a place of really being accepting of other people and what they want to [[01:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=3647.66s)]
*  need and do the only thing I don't not very sitting of his hecklers do you get [[01:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=3652.3s)]

*  being in a club and knowing what the space was like in the environment and [[01:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=3678.7s)]

*  could go away at any moment which I guess causes anxiety I feel like is what [[01:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=4291.360000000001s)]
*  I get anxiety no I think it's the easygoing anxiety but I'll say that's [[01:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=4295.54s)]
*  everybody Andy Warhol was always afraid that it was all gonna disappear once so [[01:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=4299.38s)]
*  that happens to with a lot of artists you know yeah I don't know where that [[01:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=4303.26s)]
*  comes from just thinking that everything's not gonna be okay oh wait I [[01:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=4306.78s)]
*  do know when when I was young and stuff nobody ever told me that everything's [[01:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=4311.42s)]
*  okay there was never anybody in my life who's like just saying hey everything's [[01:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=4314.18s)]
*  fine you know so there was this narrative started in my head that [[01:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=4318.22s)]
*  everything just wasn't okay you know and so and so that's I think I like oh it's [[01:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=4320.62s)]
*  just a strong swimmer that's in my bowl was that you know just that everything's [[01:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=4325.860000000001s)]
*  not okay everything's not okay like I'll call people like everything's okay right [[01:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=4331.58s)]
*  like yeah everything's okay man I think also Los Angeles has done that to me a [[01:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=4334.820000000001s)]
*  lot yeah Los Angeles is filled with status exactly I also want to say I love [[01:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=4338.780000000001s)]
*  the way that you speak you have such an idiosyncratic way of speaking when you [[01:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=4342.42s)]
*  say I've got that's just swimming around in my bowl I would never no one else [[01:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=4345.9800000000005s)]
*  except for you would say it like that but it makes perfect sense just like the [[01:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=4349.9800000000005s)]
*  fire alarm analogy but Los Angeles has so much status anxiety and there's none [[01:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=4353.78s)]
*  of that in New York right I mean we really we came back and Kate went to a [[01:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=4358.900000000001s)]
*  screening with a friend of hers and her friend was clearly had this just the [[01:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=4362.24s)]
*  status anxiety a little bit of desperation to her energy now and we [[01:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=4366.9800000000005s)]
*  hadn't seen her in a couple years and I actually didn't feel it it goes pretty [[01:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=4371.34s)]

*  Leah and Bobby Lee and stuff yeah that's always nice but I've used to feel in if [[01:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=4381.38s)]
*  I did any Eastside rooms and kind of the all hipster type rooms there's just so [[01:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=4387.54s)]
*  much status anxiety as to really I feel like that's your world no no and [[01:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=4392.860000000001s)]
*  certainly not anymore because those people have become the like woke kind of [[01:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=4397.1s)]
*  I'll go after you on Twitter that kind of stuff so for me I I really like the [[01:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=4401.820000000001s)]
*  clubs here and then in Manhattan I will do bar shows sometimes but I also just [[01:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=4408.860000000001s)]

*  a Manhattan person to me first of all going to Brooklyn to get to Brooklyn do [[01:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=4431.74s)]
*  a show and come back I could have done three shows in Manhattan right so what [[01:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=4437.0599999999995s)]
*  was the point of going to Brooklyn and second of all the audiences in Brooklyn [[01:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=4439.78s)]
*  that's not who I'm performing for in Omaha Nebraska nor is it who I'm [[01:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=4443.26s)]
*  performing for in Portland or San Francisco or Philadelphia right it's it [[01:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=4446.62s)]
*  is just Brooklyn and I don't need any of the Brooklyn cache yeah it's just a lot [[01:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=4451.74s)]
*  of judge it's definitely a lot of judgment comes out of some of those [[01:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=4456.099999999999s)]
*  holes you know I don't do the cellar right now in part because that table has [[01:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=4458.5s)]
*  a lot of status anxiety and people are thinking about hey I got to I'm past the [[01:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=4463.54s)]
*  seller and I get a little bit of energy of you know you don't you don't belong [[01:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=4467.7s)]
*  here yet you haven't paid your dues or something and no other clubs are like [[01:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=4473.38s)]
*  that so that's the only place I experienced status anxiety in New York [[01:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=4477.34s)]
*  City is in the Comedy Cellar proper and everybody else is nice to me there yeah [[01:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=4482.7s)]

*  with him no I mean I was pretty good yeah he's great but he said the way you [[01:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=5072.5199999999995s)]
*  do it is don't have your own show and which is funny because he has F is for [[01:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=5078.0s)]
*  family but he was like the best thing you can do is just not have your own [[01:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=5082.12s)]
*  show then you can say whatever you want because they can't take anything away [[01:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=5085.64s)]
*  from you right and so that's I think what was really pounded into my face is [[01:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=5088.24s)]
*  that Hollywood almost darkly prides itself on the fact that it can take [[01:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=5092.8s)]
*  everything away from you at every moment that's in fact what the stand-in is [[01:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=5098.28s)]
*  about Drew Barrymore plays a movie star and her own stand-ins she's playing two [[01:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=5102.5199999999995s)]
*  and it's about how Hollywood loves to take everything away from tear you down [[01:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=5108.72s)]
*  and then make you grovel to pull yourself back up and do an apology to her [[01:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=5112.76s)]
*  and apologize and say please you know I want to apologize to my fans I took a [[01:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=5120.0s)]
*  slavery on Mars not a slavery it is no it's like a slavery it's like they you [[01:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=5125.48s)]
*  know they can beat you and then make you apologize for making them beat you yeah [[01:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=5130.16s)]
*  sort of kind of like that and that is a slave like oh I understood why you beat [[01:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=5135.48s)]
*  me yeah exactly and I want to apologize to you for it and please give me a chance [[01:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=5139.759999999999s)]
*  to not be beaten yeah it's almost like that and so stand-up just eliminates that [[01:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=5143.799999999999s)]
*  possibility well it seemed like such a I mean because you're such a I mean you're [[01:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=5150.08s)]
*  just very different you know and you and it's hard probably to fit I would [[01:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=5155.08s)]
*  imagine I couldn't imagine being I'm do you and fitting into because a lot of [[01:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=5161.04s)]
*  things are very systematic the world we live in is a lot of systems that work [[01:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=5166.24s)]
*  best because it facilitates all these moving people at once and I think that's [[01:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=5170.08s)]
*  a good point there is a component of me that doesn't fit in very well to [[01:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=5174.96s)]
*  predisposed systems whether that be any kind of I mean really any kind of system [[01:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=5180.96s)]
*  whether that be like the rules that a theme park or you know the school system [[01:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=5187.72s)]
*  I had a real tough problem with that and the Hollywood system I think for a long [[01:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=5194.08s)]
*  time is not really known what to do with me especially because I'm a self [[01:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=5198.400000000001s)]
*  professed comedian not actor right so when I heard you say that before when I [[01:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=5201.7s)]
*  left Silicon Valley they didn't understand they're like what are you [[01:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=5206.84s)]
*  doing and I was like I just think this is a really funny ending to it if I sort [[01:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=5210.320000000001s)]
*  of go off in this opium den and I think this is a good time for me to sort of [[01:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=5214.84s)]
*  end the series or end my part with series and then the series can change [[01:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=5219.08s)]
*  and grow and they're like but okay do you want to come back and do three out [[01:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=5222.96s)]
*  of ten episodes because HBO is super cool they were like do you want to come [[01:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=5227.160000000001s)]
*  back and do three out of the eight episodes were and I said no no I think [[01:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=5231.04s)]
*  it's really funny to end it just like this on this and this four seasons is [[01:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=5234.0s)]
*  great that was great thank you and they're like well what about the season [[01:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=5238.08s)]
*  finale I was like no that's okay and they're like just you're not even open [[01:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=5241.28s)]
*  to this season and what it was is they were like but you're an actor and you're [[01:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=5245.599999999999s)]
*  on a successful television show this is what every actor always dreamed of so [[01:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=5249.5199999999995s)]
*  you how can you walk away from that and it's like because I'm not an actor you [[01:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=5253.92s)]
*  know what I mean it wasn't my dream to be Ehrlich on Silicon Valley it was my [[01:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=5258.24s)]
*  dream to work with Mike Judge and make a television show that people loved or be [[01:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=5262.219999999999s)]
*  a part of one for sure but I also have made television shows like Corburger or [[01:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=5266.16s)]
*  mash-up that people have loved I do stand-up which I really love and I make [[01:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=5270.84s)]
*  films that people love so it I was kind of like I don't want to and so that's [[01:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=5276.56s)]
*  an example of Hollywood itself being like I don't like this guy doesn't give [[01:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=5281.08s)]
*  a shit or is he really act like he's good is he an arrogant asshole or is he [[01:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=5285.92s)]
*  truly a nihilist what is really going on with this person so I can be very [[01:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=5290.76s)]
*  confusing to those systems and I think that's why I thrive in kind of [[01:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=5294.96s)]
*  independent projects stand-up being the most important film being sort of a [[01:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=5301.5s)]
*  capsule that happens it goes out and then I'm on to the next thing I'm not [[01:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=5306.8s)]
*  sort of on a television show for years and years and why I respect people like [[01:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=5312.12s)]
*  you who sort of have done this which is to create your own system and your own [[01:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=5317.0s)]
*  kind of and then you've thrived from that and then that becomes theaters you [[01:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=5322.44s)]
*  know and selling out clubs and stuff like that so that that and I think I'm [[01:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=5327.36s)]
*  also drawn to stand-up comics because they usually don't necessarily fit in [[01:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=5331.679999999999s)]
*  any system they're not willing to fall in line yeah yeah you know I think [[01:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=5336.36s)]
*  that's something yeah I never I never wanted to if something wasn't unique I [[01:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=5341.36s)]
*  never wanted to do it or probably and you didn't want to be a part of it [[01:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=5349.5s)]
*  necessarily you have had a tough time being a part of things sometimes because [[01:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=5352.98s)]
*  I think in nature I never felt a part of things so then why would I naturally [[01:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=5356.26s)]
*  easily I would it would be tough to gravitate towards it sometimes you know [[01:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=5360.18s)]
*  um but you know I think it's interesting what you're saying man I mean I think [[01:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=5364.82s)]
*  yeah bird does a great job of it in the sense that he does stand up he created [[01:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=5367.9s)]
*  an animation he kind of jumps into things here and there but there's nothing [[01:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=5371.58s)]
*  that's like keeping him in a stable and a tether constantly yeah he's not [[01:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=5375.42s)]
*  tethered at all and he's pretty strongly a stand-up yeah he really is and that's [[01:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=5379.46s)]
*  been another interesting thing is to interact with people because so many [[01:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=5385.820000000001s)]
*  stand-ups that I know really wanted to act you know I don't know how well you [[01:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=5389.54s)]
*  want you want to succeed and there's this there's this thing that like that [[01:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=5393.62s)]
*  Hollywood is a success there's this thing especially even with our parents [[01:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=5399.780000000001s)]
*  our generation I mean I think I'm a little older than you but where they [[01:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=5403.74s)]
*  television is it like I can tour around the world doing comedy but they're like [[01:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=5407.62s)]
*  oh if I didn't see on an episode of everybody loves Raymond are you doing [[01:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=5412.86s)]

*  stand-up to become a television star or movie star whatever talk show host and [[01:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=5455.9s)]
*  that just hasn't been my end-all be-all and I'm so happy I'm doing an [[01:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=5461.26s)]

*  certainly as happy but I was happier doing that than being on the cover of a [[01:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=5487.46s)]
*  magazine because I'm on a hit television show or I'm part of a big movie [[01:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=5492.780000000001s)]

*  both or for all of it but I don't really think success is in success for me in a [[01:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=5502.42s)]
*  lot of ways is is less in what you get and more in how much control you have [[01:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8NYTBSu7pY&t=5509.9800000000005s)]
