*  Yeah, I bet if you'd have written it on the inside of a 12-pack you'd have read it. Yeah, not he would have [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=281.6s)]
*  He would have oh, he's gonna read his own epitaph soon, dude [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=287.20000000000005s)]

*  I thought it would just it was kind of a perfect reflection of like where a lot of people are at in their lives right now [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=302.76000000000005s)]
*  I think just as a society as a [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=308.28000000000003s)]
*  species [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=310.4s)]
*  in like this kind of [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=313.03999999999996s)]
*  Not only a quest maybe for spirituality, but an examination of spiritual of spirituality [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=315.32s)]
*  Yeah, what spirituality means all kind of stuff like that. So I thought it was and we can get into it. But um [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=321.15999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, I know you said that there was it's hard for people [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=328.32s)]
*  Why do they lock up the pissers in the office buildings was interesting while they lock them? [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=330.67999999999995s)]
*  So do you want to go from my book on spirituality to like to locking up restrooms [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=335.48s)]
*  Is that where we is that the transition? Yeah, I do and everything at once kind of okay [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=342.6s)]
*  Yeah, so I have this problem and I think it's a problem. I don't know that it exists in other cities [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=347.36s)]
*  But in LA it's this kind of thing where every single bathroom needs a key and like what the hell like just let them [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=352.72s)]
*  Be open like I understand if you got a building like on Skid Row downtown [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=359.12s)]
*  Like maybe you just don't want someone setting up a tent in there and moving in or something like that [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=363.8s)]
*  Like I get that but you'd be like we're out here in the middle of the San Fernando Valley [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=368.92s)]
*  What do they think like someone's gonna? [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=373.48s)]
*  Wander into this building off the street and like come in and like do something nefarious [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=375.72s)]
*  Shoot up drugs in the in the restroom. Why do you need keys? Yeah [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=381.08s)]
*  Well, they should give you a certain if you do swell enough [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=385.2s)]
*  You should get a general a key to at least so many bathrooms. That's a good idea [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=388.96000000000004s)]
*  There could be like an app you unlock it. It's like a game. It's like Candy Crush and you play it enough [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=394.08000000000004s)]
*  You're a responsible enough citizen with your app you get into bathrooms wherever you could take a shit wherever you're like [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=400.0s)]
*  Oh, I'm going down the valley. I'm not gonna name what stop off the 101 your app [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=406.5s)]
*  But you know you're down the 101 like oh man [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=410.44s)]
*  I really need to go and like you you have an app [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=412.84000000000003s)]
*  It's like when you have an app that searches for you know [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=415.62s)]
*  Charging stations for your electric car, you know, you've got an app with a little map on it [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=419.98s)]
*  And then this allows you to come in and yeah, take a dookie. Yeah, you're privileged [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=423.86s)]
*  Yeah, I can shit off a victory Boulevard now [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=428.90000000000003s)]
*  And it opens up I [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=432.1s)]
*  Don't know because something the key thing has got to it's a very LA thing [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=434.34000000000003s)]
*  I don't imagine they do that in Cincinnati [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=438.1s)]
*  I imagine in Cincinnati like you just park and you can just go in and like take a crap somewhere [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=439.74s)]
*  Yeah, yeah and people recognize that people have to take craps. I think it's like here. They almost want to pretend like oh [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=445.06s)]
*  God you weirdo have with your bodily with your bowels in your old-fashioned [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=453.66s)]
*  Urethra or whatever you have to go and do urine or whatever like oh you peasant [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=460.38s)]
*  Come get a key like they almost make it like it's an outhouse, but it's inside kind of right, right [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=466.42s)]
*  It's it's elitist like LA is so elitist and then even the bathrooms are elitist [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=471.88s)]
*  Yeah, you gotta go sometimes, you know what? It's like sometimes you got appointments around town and you got really got to go [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=476.64s)]
*  What are you gonna do? Like Starbucks is really the only place that's open grocery stores are pretty good. Do you notice that? [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=482.08s)]
*  Yeah, there's always a bathroom in a grocery store. You'd never think that that's like the land of accessible bathrooms [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=487.68s)]
*  It's a long hike. You gotta get back in there. I'm not gonna I'm not gonna lie [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=494.54s)]
*  You get you pulled into a Ralph's or an ANP you got a you got to traverse a couple hundred yards before you get [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=498.56s)]
*  Back to that thing and the frozen food aisle [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=504.36s)]
*  You notice if you traverse down that one it feels longer than the other aisles for some reason does it really? [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=506.48s)]
*  Yeah, I think so [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=510.92s)]
*  It feels cuz there's it just feels brighter and like kind of vibe like someone could have had to be doing a party in a couple [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=511.68s)]
*  Hours that is that it's also maybe an optical illusion. Yeah, and [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=517.48s)]
*  It's kind of like Luke Skywalker flying the TIE fighter through yes down those long [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=522.6s)]
*  Yeah, you're right. It all feels the same [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=528.84s)]
*  So I think there's this weird thing in your head where it doesn't feel new for a few seconds [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=530.84s)]
*  Yeah, so it's just like am I stuck in a corridor whereas on a regular aisle? It's like these are the red chips [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=534.32s)]
*  These are the brown, you know little cookies so it keeps changing and it's like do you ever go back in the back of a grocery? [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=538.7800000000001s)]
*  store and like [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=545.6s)]
*  You got to use the bathroom and then you go through the employees swinging doors like employees only but you have to go back [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=547.5200000000001s)]
*  There's a whole world back there [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=554.32s)]
*  It's a magical world back there well, there's usually somebody's kind of crying a little bit [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=556.84s)]
*  Somebody has a hairnet right bigger when you see that out of the gate, you know [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=561.6s)]
*  Yeah, and then somebody has their hands on somebody else's back and they're consoling them, but the hands are covered with [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=565.88s)]

*  So there was obviously [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=584.6800000000001s)]
*  Why do grocery stores always have the same things in the deli section? You ever notice that you go in you go shopping [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=586.6800000000001s)]

*  Yeah [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=622.8000000000001s)]
*  Let those chefs in the hair nets with the plastic gloves like let them let them be creative. Let them be creative [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=623.76s)]

*  They encounter a lot of racist cowboys out there. Oh, yeah, you China man [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=1042.94s)]
*  You know spit like and then of course, there's a couple fights. This chopsticks got bullets in it stuff like that [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=1047.5800000000002s)]

*  but anyways, I talk about it in my book because I feel like there it's it is a it's a metaphor for [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=1060.3000000000002s)]
*  spirituality because in spirituality [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=1067.9s)]
*  We we're walking around the crazy chaotic Old West [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=1070.94s)]
*  that's an aggressive and violent and we're bringing to bear our wisdom and our [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=1075.7s)]

*  He's always got really beautiful wise things to say. Mm-hmm [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=1087.5s)]
*  To try and heal people but there's always like some drunken racist cowboy there that you got up at the end of the day [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=1092.86s)]
*  You got a pony up, you know, but I'm gonna make orange chicken out of you or something like that [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=1098.6599999999999s)]
*  That's good. That's good. You should have been on this you should be a staff [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=1103.82s)]
*  Maybe that could have been good. Yeah, but uh [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=1107.6599999999999s)]
*  Yeah, well like but so but so go on so you think so it's like it's kind of like we need that now [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=1110.98s)]
*  We we can use that we can use that always [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=1117.1000000000001s)]
*  But that's what I kind of derived from the beginning of your book the I think I read like 23% of it maybe [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=1119.9s)]
*  but that we [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=1127.26s)]
*  How do we get to where we start to look at ourselves? [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=1129.6200000000001s)]
*  You want us to look at more as ourselves as a group and not just as individuals [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=1133.46s)]
*  Well, that's see that and that's the point I bring up kung fu because [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=1138.1799999999998s)]
*  To me a lot of people when they think about spirituality they think about [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=1143.54s)]
*  Something I mean, there's there's folks that think of spirituality as synonymous with church, right? [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=1147.78s)]
*  So they like they go to church on Sunday and that's where they get their spirituality and they hear a sermon [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=1154.58s)]
*  but I'm talking about like many people feel like spirituality is something that [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=1159.1799999999998s)]
*  You know they pray or they meditate or they read a [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=1164.3799999999999s)]
*  spiritual book or the Bible or a [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=1167.26s)]
*  philosopher or something like that and they go to the yoga class or something like that, but that that spirituality is something internal that we kind of [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=1169.8999999999999s)]
*  process and develop [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=1178.1s)]
*  inside of ourselves and [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=1179.9799999999998s)]
*  I bring up kung fu because I compare and contrast it to Star Trek. Yeah, which is [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=1182.62s)]
*  For me a different way of looking at spirituality because Star Trek is about the journey of humanity [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=1189.3s)]
*  itself like the bigger picture [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=1196.1399999999999s)]
*  now true Star Trek is more about like technology and whatnot, but it's [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=1199.34s)]
*  In the planet on Star Trek [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=1204.98s)]
*  Humanity has had a big war [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=1208.06s)]
*  This is before the original series starts [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=1210.7s)]
*  We've overcome racism out of that war. We were getting along [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=1213.82s)]
*  Everyone's getting along we've solved like sexism. We've solved income inequality. There's like [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=1218.34s)]
*  You know great peace and justice and tranquility on planet Earth [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=1224.82s)]
*  Which allows us to build all these spaceships and go flying around the universe seeking out strange new life and new civilizations and whatnot [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=1228.5s)]
*  But there's a there's a there is a spiritual maturity. There's a progression of humanity, right toward this [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=1237.1s)]
*  mature spiritual and [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=1244.6599999999999s)]
*  So I bring I contrast those two because I think that sometimes people lose sight of the fact that [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=1247.38s)]
*  There can be a spiritual [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=1254.0600000000002s)]
*  transformation and [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=1256.14s)]
*  maturation of us seven billion of us on the planet and [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=1257.5s)]
*  I mean that's just something important to talk about and think about [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=1262.3400000000001s)]
*  Because it doesn't get it doesn't really get brought up or discussed that much it doesn't [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=1266.42s)]
*  a lot of things focus on the now we get a little bit further out when we look at things like [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=1271.0600000000002s)]
*  um [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=1276.66s)]
*  Like our own lives and stuff like that like the limitation of our own lives what will happen in our lifetime [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=1278.8600000000001s)]
*  But rarely do you start to think? [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=1284.18s)]
*  What can I if there's an overall goal that there's like a destination as a people or a populous? [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=1286.8600000000001s)]

*  It's the same thing that I think it's like is that that I we're becoming grumpy old man [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=1950.56s)]
*  Or is it that we have some concern for the intrinsic value of what it seems like to us [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=1955.84s)]
*  What it means to be human, you know [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=1964.0s)]
*  Mm-hmm, and I don't know if we are like [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=1967.52s)]
*  Or does nature and the gods do they have some longer destiny for us to end up as robots? [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=1970.76s)]
*  And these are like the shell we are like just the snails before they get the shell, you know [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=1977.04s)]
*  It's like we don't know where we are in the chain of time, you know [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=1982.08s)]
*  There was a book a science fiction book. I read I used to read a lot of science fiction. It was called City [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=1986.12s)]
*  by Clifford DC Mac and it it every [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=1991.48s)]
*  section of the book [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=1996.28s)]
*  Took you through eons and Earth's development and like there's after the humans [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=1998.04s)]
*  Expired on planet Earth then it was the dogs [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=2004.4399999999998s)]
*  So then it's like a whole chapter about dogs ruling the earth and then it's and then it's the ants and then the ants rule [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=2007.72s)]
*  the earth and then I think at the end it's like the dolphins or something like that, so it's [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=2014.56s)]
*  stories [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=2018.44s)]
*  You know set thousands of years apart and the dogs are living in the ruins of humanity [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=2019.6s)]
*  So there's these shells of these cities, but they're these talking dogs and they're talking about life and love and yeah stuff like that [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=2025.04s)]
*  So yeah, maybe this is just one just pit stop on the on the way of the development of planet Earth [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=2031.4199999999998s)]
*  I [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=2037.8s)]
*  Think it makes I don't know if it makes me I think there's some part of me that laments that or makes me feel sad [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=2040.72s)]
*  About it because I think in some ego way [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=2046.6000000000001s)]
*  I want to feel more important than that or I want my time period to feel more important than that [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=2049.34s)]
*  I often feel like it's very even though I feel like I'm aware of some of the things that you kind of think about [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=2055.52s)]
*  And the things that you talk about in your book [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=2060.88s)]
*  I feel like I still struggle to combat those even though I try to use things like prayer meditation [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=2062.56s)]
*  You know I'm in recovery so I go to those yeah me too, so I'm a part of that group [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=2069.96s)]

*  but even then it's like [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=2082.76s)]
*  It's really hard to [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=2085.48s)]
*  Not feel like you're just on the conveyor belt sometimes but that you [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=2088.44s)]
*  Maybe we used to have a we used to dance on the conveyor belt and like whistle and do marshmallows and stuff and now we're [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=2094.56s)]

*  I'm hard to pet uh-huh. I don't it's hard for me to let people pet me hmm [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=2146.84s)]
*  That's a great way of putting it. It was just an interesting insight um [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=2152.2s)]
*  What affection you do you mean like intimacy like yeah, I think like with good friends and with like [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=2157.16s)]
*  Relationships and girlfriends and whatnot yeah, I think probably like commitment and like that kind of stuff intimacy like really [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=2163.6s)]
*  Dropping in to connecting with somebody [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=2170.6800000000003s)]
*  I think it's kind of tough [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=2173.32s)]
*  I know it's kind of tough for me. Yeah, you know, but I don't want to talk too much about myself [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=2176.36s)]
*  You know okay, what about yourself? [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=2181.88s)]
*  I mean obviously a lot in your book and a lot in your show you know that you're [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=2188.08s)]
*  Search you're in a searching space. Yeah, I you know I'm in recovery I [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=2192.92s)]
*  Have a lot of anxiety I've dealt with a lot of depression before a lot of loneliness [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=2198.64s)]
*  I've been through some really dark times [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=2204.84s)]
*  and [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=2208.52s)]
*  You know so for me like part of this spiritual search and why I'm writing about it and talking about it and [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=2211.44s)]
*  thinking about it so much as I need tools to help me cope with my anxiety and help me find [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=2220.12s)]
*  peace and serenity and [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=2227.96s)]
*  and [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=2230.64s)]
*  as I [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=2232.16s)]
*  Undertake that journey so I view kind of my anxiety disorder as something almost akin to diabetes [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=2233.84s)]
*  Where you have friends with diabetes and every day they got to take their blood [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=2240.64s)]
*  Right monitor my apple or something they fall over right exactly shovel some applesauce in their mouth real quick [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=2245.4s)]
*  And yeah, we had this one day. We'd always frickin just put one of them Twix in him, bro [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=2251.16s)]
*  Ain't me I mean I never did that an old twix I have it, but they kind of shaped perfectly right [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=2255.1800000000003s)]
*  So but I have to do the same thing with anxiety like I have to I have to not nothing is not anal [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=2263.26s)]
*  But I have to monitor it every day, and I can live with it, and I do okay [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=2270.78s)]
*  But I do have I have to meditate I have to work out I have to pray I have to surrender [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=2275.0s)]
*  I have to stay connected with people I can isolate pretty easily yeah, so [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=2280.1000000000004s)]
*  but [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=2284.94s)]
*  That has led me on on the search so I I would say my biggest struggle is with my own [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=2286.34s)]
*  As with my anxiety and with my ego too hmm. You know yeah ego so scary isn't it I? [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=2291.9s)]
*  Must be I mean I've been at it for a long time [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=2298.38s)]
*  And I struggled a lot more with ego like early on in the success of the office and stuff [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=2301.78s)]
*  But must be hard for you like you were [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=2306.3s)]
*  you're toying away in obscurity doing like chuckles comedy hut in Oklahoma City and then [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=2309.26s)]
*  all of a sudden like just in the last like four years like you've just like [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=2314.78s)]
*  Blown up and like you're practically gonna be put on Mount Rushmore. It's a crazy amount of [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=2319.6200000000003s)]
*  Fame for a you know itchy hillbilly such as yourself [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=2325.1000000000004s)]
*  You're right [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=2330.3s)]
*  That's a good call. Yeah, I think oh well [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=2332.2200000000003s)]
*  It's scared me that has to have been a that has to be a struggle, too [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=2335.46s)]
*  Oh, it's the first thing was a sheer fear. I thought this was a this was crazy [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=2338.9s)]
*  I thought God has some this was the worst part that happened [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=2343.74s)]
*  I thought God has some special purpose for me and that there's something special that he needs me to do [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=2347.66s)]
*  But he does and and that may be true, but he has that for everyone. I think right yeah [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=2353.14s)]
*  But I now you have a platform and so you know I feel like I'm some response with increased power comes increased responsibility [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=2357.7799999999997s)]
*  Yeah, heavy is the head that wears the crown bro. Yeah, and you almost wearing the podcast crown [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=2364.54s)]
*  Yeah, well they called me the rat king you know and I don't even pick it out [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=2370.06s)]
*  You know it's just the king of rats, but um [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=2373.22s)]
*  But that was real scary man. You can order rats around [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=2376.22s)]
*  Do you have a psychic connection to rats by the way? I think like think about ant-man like that pitch meeting at Marvel like [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=2380.7799999999997s)]
*  All right, okay ant-man mm-hmm. What's his power? Yeah, he can turn tiny [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=2388.2999999999997s)]
*  you picture them like [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=2394.8999999999996s)]
*  It's pretty good. I mean that could be fun. We don't have a shrinking guy, but it's not quite enough. We need something more [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=2397.9s)]
*  He has a psychic power to be able to call ants [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=2406.2200000000003s)]
*  To help him out mm-hmm also he can shrink and communicate with ants [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=2410.7400000000002s)]
*  We'll call him ant-man [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=2417.1s)]
*  But the two powers really aren't related and yeah, do you know what I mean? [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=2419.42s)]
*  It would be like Superman's power is he has strength and he can fly and he can also read books backwards [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=2423.42s)]
*  Yeah, you know I mean like it doesn't right right they don't and he can also weigh a Christmas ham with his eyes right right [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=2430.6200000000003s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's yeah. I think I don't know if well. I think Hollywood has done a [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=2437.3s)]
*  They've done a disservice to imagination because it's been now [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=2444.1000000000004s)]
*  I think it used to be a novel place where more people came they came out in their wagons from [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=2448.3s)]
*  Kalamazoo with their bag of ideas on their back [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=2455.02s)]
*  Yep, and now I think it's just you know [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=2459.46s)]
*  Someone's so son or grandson. They're in the seventh generation of their studio or film [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=2462.46s)]
*  They haven't had a new idea that isn't based on an algorithm walking the door in 12 years [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=2467.82s)]
*  And they wouldn't know something novel and unique unless it beat them upside the head [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=2473.2999999999997s)]
*  I think a lot of times now that might be a very narrow view of Hollywood by why you guys [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=2479.18s)]
*  like [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=2485.74s)]
*  Bert and you and Tom I'm sure there's others, but those are the main three that I watched like [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=2486.9s)]
*  You don't have you don't have to pitch anything. You can just make your own shit and [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=2492.2599999999998s)]
*  Hundreds of thousands of people or millions of people are gonna watch it and you get to do your own like Bert's got a whole enterprise [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=2498.34s)]
*  Over there. He's got movies going and oh, yeah [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=2504.42s)]

*  Am I like one of my childhood heroes? That's amazing [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=2510.82s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, and you didn't need to go into Sony and like pitch it or anything like you just kind of did it [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=2513.98s)]
*  Yeah, just kept in it. It'll sell but is it Joe dirt too? I wish it was damn Joe dirt 7 [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=2518.82s)]
*  They made Joe dirt too. Oh, I didn't know either. I didn't know that I mean I knew but I didn't want you know [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=2524.82s)]
*  nobody was saying that they knew but um, but it was it was something like [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=2530.26s)]
*  This one's about busboys like the last busboys [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=2536.02s)]
*  You know and we think if we become waiters and everything in our life will change, you know [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=2539.6200000000003s)]
*  But we just it's just a misguided thought isn't that so true. I [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=2543.98s)]
*  remember I was [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=2549.1000000000004s)]

*  I'm on the office and [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=2559.7799999999997s)]
*  Then it was just like well, how do I get to be a movie star? [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=2562.22s)]
*  Now I'm a TV star and like the second I'm TV star. I can't even like enjoy it [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=2566.5s)]

*  You mean yeah the movies move my movies never people never really liked or saw my movies very much. Hmm [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=2580.98s)]

*  Well, I think a lot of them were neat and and people tell me they like them now like the rocker and stuff like that [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=2589.62s)]

*  Instead of maybe we should all do that is throw away the word God [[01:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=3871.68s)]
*  It's such a loaded word right except for Michael Landon this highway to heaven but that [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=3875.12s)]
*  and [[01:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=3881.6s)]
*  Just substitute the great mystery like, you know, did you did you pray to the great mystery today or right? [[01:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=3882.72s)]
*  Oh, thank the great mystery or ask the great mystery for help or like, you know great mystery. Damn it. Yeah [[01:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=3887.92s)]
*  I don't know [[01:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=3895.2799999999997s)]
*  but I really love that idea and that was very [[01:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=3896.3599999999997s)]
*  resonant for me as a young person because I was really struggling with God and higher power and I [[01:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=3899.04s)]
*  Didn't know what that meant to me and you know, my parents were religious [[01:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=3904.04s)]
*  But I didn't have the same conception that they did and that really allowed me to kind of have a different vision for what a higher [[01:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=3907.44s)]
*  power could be which was [[01:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=3915.16s)]
*  Something that is not separate from nature and something that is not separate from physical reality [[01:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=3917.32s)]
*  it is in physical reality and and in nature and and [[01:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=3922.64s)]
*  Yet part of it and also above it at the same time and the idea I love I [[01:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=3927.12s)]
*  Was gonna say I love mysteries, but I don't mean like I go love mystery podcasts. I mean I love [[01:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=3932.28s)]
*  You know, I just love as an artist. I love the idea of life being this mystery. Mm-hmm [[01:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=3937.32s)]
*  So I I found that very helpful and I think we could get real humble and we really screwed over in Native Americans in this country [[01:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=3945.6s)]
*  And yeah [[01:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=3952.32s)]
*  We should go back to the reservation and help them out and learn from them and not, you know [[01:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=3953.0s)]
*  Tell them what to do and when to do it but actually be humble and learn from them because they might have something to teach us [[01:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=3957.72s)]
*  Agreed. I mean, I think we I think we're start [[01:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=3965.04s)]
*  There's a lot of people that are trying to get back to those spaces now [[01:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=3967.7599999999998s)]
*  I think in a lot of ways, you know [[01:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=3971.4199999999996s)]
*  you see it with like a lot of ayahuasca used and people getting back to the jungle and having [[01:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=3972.96s)]
*  Experiences that really bring them closer to nature. Yeah [[01:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=3978.8399999999997s)]
*  But I can imagine yeah [[01:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=3982.94s)]
*  I'm not gonna litter if I think that the ground has some semblance of sacredness, of course not right? [[01:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=3984.3s)]
*  It's gonna things are gonna have so much more value to me. Yeah, I'm not gonna strip mine that mountain right and [[01:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=3990.86s)]
*  cause an ecological disaster [[01:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=3998.94s)]
*  You know [[01:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=4001.1000000000004s)]
*  there's all these floods that have been happening in West Virginia and they [[01:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=4001.7200000000003s)]
*  They call it when they were doing all the strip mining in the 70s and 80s [[01:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=4004.34s)]
*  they're like this is gonna be an ecological disaster because [[01:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=4007.6800000000003s)]
*  You're wiping out all these trees and you're just digging these trenches and digging up the coal [[01:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=4010.12s)]
*  You know from these mountain sides and then when it rains and floods, you know, you're just you're you're fucked [[01:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=4014.52s)]
*  Yeah, but if those mountains were sacred the people wouldn't tolerate it, you know, because you can have both you can have jobs and [[01:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=4020.52s)]
*  You can have sacred land [[01:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=4029.0s)]
*  Yeah, we kind of sold ours [[01:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=4032.12s)]
*  I mean I think about that a lot like especially in the US did we like sell ourselves out or did? [[01:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=4033.3999999999996s)]
*  How did we get on this wrong path where? [[01:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=4040.08s)]
*  Or are we on a wrong path you don't know but it feels like [[01:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=4044.3599999999997s)]
*  There's some there must be something more if so many people are looking for meaning I think and [[01:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=4049.3999999999996s)]
*  Feeling you know something real [[01:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=4056.3599999999997s)]
*  And [[01:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=4059.64s)]
*  especially before we get so trapped into [[01:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=4061.12s)]
*  The digital universe [[01:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=4064.12s)]
*  That you can't even come out. I mean there a smile might be in a museum one day [[01:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=4066.2s)]
*  You might have to go to a museum to see a smile. I like the Museum of smiles [[01:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=4070.96s)]
*  But that'd be so crazy. Yeah, I remember Rick [[01:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=4075.44s)]
*  You'd be right up there. Yeah, I'm everyone Eddie got his first man when everyone any first orgasm [[01:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=4080.3199999999997s)]
*  Yeah, I'm Erwin Eddie got his first orgasm. He's just like [[01:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=4084.96s)]
*  It's not quite a smile. Okay [[01:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=4088.7599999999998s)]
*  Like [[01:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=4090.76s)]
*  Go to the curator like that's not technically a smile. It's a grimace of ecstasy, but it's not quite a smile [[01:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=4092.28s)]
*  Okay, it's our biggest attraction buddy. All right, calm down [[01:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=4098.4400000000005s)]
*  I [[01:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=4103.08s)]
*  think too like [[01:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=4104.2s)]
*  We're at you know, we talked about people in the future looking back at this time [[01:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=4106.400000000001s)]
*  We talked about phones and distractions and boredom [[01:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=4111.400000000001s)]
*  But the other thing too is like the amount of disunity and the fact that America is so divided [[01:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=4114.320000000001s)]
*  49 percent on each side Democrat and Republican and this partisanship and the how deadlocked it is and how much fighting there is [[01:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=4120.299999999999s)]
*  and [[01:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=4129.46s)]
*  It's in it's really it's so sad because we've so many problems that need fixing, you know and [[01:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=4130.62s)]
*  You know like [[01:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=4138.86s)]
*  Republicans might criticize Democrats like oh, they're running their cities [[01:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=4140.42s)]
*  Terribly and there's whole this homelessness and they kind of mock it right on Fox News [[01:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=4143.66s)]
*  And then the left does the same thing [[01:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=4148.46s)]
*  They'll be like to find some other problem in Republican Republican states and like and then make fun of that and it's like [[01:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=4150.46s)]
*  Why aren't we helping each other? [[01:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=4157.1s)]
*  Like why why is partisanship become the de facto way to kind of do business? [[01:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=4158.54s)]
*  Mm-hmm. It doesn't it doesn't make sense. It's not practical. It doesn't get shit done and it's not helping anyone and [[01:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=4164.18s)]
*  We really need to move past it, you know, I was thinking about [[01:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=4173.5s)]
*  Debates and [[01:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=4179.1s)]
*  Isn't it funny on like you watch a political debate and then immediately there's articles like an hour later [[01:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=4183.54s)]
*  like who won the debate and the reason that they say that they won the debate is they got more zingers in on the other person and [[01:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=4188.9s)]
*  Then that's who we elect is the person who is able to get more zingers in on the other person as if that's a leadership [[01:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=4197.14s)]
*  skill could you imagine you're running for class president as a senior in high school and [[01:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=4203.38s)]
*  You know, it's it's it's Bobby and Darren and like Bobby's like well Darren's got a such an overbite [[01:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=4209.14s)]
*  You know, he looks like a woodchuck. Haha. Let's vote for him [[01:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=4215.82s)]
*  Like no the teachers would never allow that looks now. What's your policy position? How are you gonna help the school? [[01:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=4220.42s)]
*  But how are you gonna fix Darren's teeth? [[01:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=4226.02s)]
*  How are we gonna have a fundraiser for braces for Darren and his poor over by yeah, like I agree [[01:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=4228.78s)]
*  Yeah, it's that is well the news something happened when the news fell off it used to feel like and we talked about this [[01:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=4234.679999999999s)]
*  And I was on here that you could rely on the news, right? Yeah [[01:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=4241.82s)]
*  I feel like my parents and your parents probably felt like the news [[01:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=4244.24s)]
*  Had a general interest in the wellness of their viewer. Yeah, and now it does not it feels like the news [[01:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=4248.5599999999995s)]
*  Wants to be like a nicotine for their viewer [[01:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=4256.24s)]
*  great and that [[01:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=4259.679999999999s)]
*  Outrage keeps you watching and if you read if you look through like Yahoo news feed online [[01:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=4261.8s)]
*  I'm not talking about like cable news, but it works in cable news to you if they keep you outraged [[01:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=4267.08s)]
*  Yeah, they keep you coming back. Oh people like they always end like the end of the news show like after the commercial you won't believe [[01:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=4272.5s)]
*  Yeah, well this kid did to this man's face. Yeah with a baseball bat [[01:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=4281.0s)]
*  After these messages this guy hit a two-run double on this senior citizen [[01:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=4286.88s)]
*  Jesus Wow. Yeah, that's a terrible baseball analogy. Some guys dead. Yeah man's head [[01:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=4292.16s)]
*  Found locally we'll be back right after this still alive and it'll say and you're like what? [[01:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=4299.56s)]
*  Show a picture [[01:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=4307.400000000001s)]
*  Yeah, it makes you but then like there you feel like there's a swing to everything [[01:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=4309.200000000001s)]
*  So it's like are we just hopefully at this point of the pin, you know, we're at the out and then [[01:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=4313.54s)]
*  There's a turn that we can't see that's coming or that maybe we hope for you know [[01:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=4319.56s)]
*  Because I wonder if people have thought this way in the past as well if people have felt as nervous about the future [[01:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=4325.400000000001s)]
*  Well Civil War oh that had to be definitely huh? Yeah, I mean that was [[01:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=4332.32s)]
*  That that resulted in hundreds of thousands of deaths, right? You ever hit any of the reenactments or anything? [[01:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=4337.16s)]
*  Probably not where you're from. You're from the northwest, right? I'm Seattle. Yeah, we have reenactments [[01:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=4342.84s)]

*  They would do before the fight or whatever was definitely because the south loses every time, you know [[01:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=4387.04s)]
*  There was one day where they kind of won, but it was like [[01:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=4391.4s)]
*  You know historically they've lost and so [[01:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=4395.52s)]
*  Yes, sometimes you'd have groups from the north that would come and they would do it [[01:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=4399.32s)]
*  It was like a big deal. Oh, you have Yankee reenactors come down and yeah [[01:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=4402.46s)]

*  He's a little bit more of a Dwight character and the other guy's more of a player [[01:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=4498.12s)]
*  And likes to do some the ladies and like doesn't take it as seriously. Yeah, it would be the player guy [[01:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=4502.04s)]

*  Um you talk about [[01:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=4568.259999999999s)]
*  You talk about faith [[01:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=4571.98s)]
*  In your book, yeah [[01:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=4575.54s)]
*  What's that been like for you and like I know and a Hollywood a lot of times seemed like there's not a lot of faith [[01:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=4577.62s)]
*  And I mean, it's a very business world, you know, and maybe the world is overall [[01:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=4582.74s)]
*  I don't want to just I pick on Hollywood a lot good. You should but it's very uh, I [[01:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=4586.62s)]
*  Don't know, you know, I like faith I like having something other than myself in the world I need it yeah, I do too. Yeah [[01:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=4593.7s)]
*  Yeah, it's I'll tell you something. I was thinking about this the other day like there's a lot of weirdos in the comedy world in Hollywood and [[01:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=4601.7s)]
*  Everyone kind of prides themselves on being like oh, I'm eccentric and I'm weird and this and that and [[01:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=4611.219999999999s)]
*  But for me it was always a little weird because I'd always want to talk about [[01:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=4615.78s)]
*  Faith and God and the soul and life after death and kind of big concepts and whatnot [[01:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=4619.3s)]
*  In the comedy world just did not know what to do with me. Like who is this guy who's talking about God? [[01:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=4624.46s)]
*  It's the unsexiest uncoolest [[01:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=4629.78s)]
*  thing to talk about [[01:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=4632.74s)]
*  Anywhere and but especially like in the too cool for school comedy world [[01:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=4636.34s)]
*  You've got all these eccentric and misfits and losers as they describe themselves, but then they also want to be cool [[01:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=4640.98s)]
*  They want to be like the cool kids in the lunchroom, right the cool kids table [[01:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=4646.58s)]
*  So it was it was always hard for me because I always wanted to talk about that stuff and people just didn't know [[01:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=4650.54s)]
*  What to do with that guy? He's also weird that guy who plays Dwight [[01:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=4657.34s)]
*  But then he talks about spiritual topics and stuff. Well, the gods must be crazy was a huge movie, wasn't it? Yeah [[01:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=4661.9s)]
*  Yeah, it was I remember somebody snuck that in our apartment when I was a kid and we watched that's a South African movie about that [[01:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=4668.46s)]
*  But the coke bottle, yeah, yeah, yeah that fell down from the sky. Yeah, I was like, what is this even about? [[01:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=4674.98s)]
*  But we watched it probably 30 times [[01:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=4680.419999999999s)]
*  Family man. Have you seen that? [[01:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=4683.099999999999s)]

*  God and faith and [[01:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=4732.52s)]
*  Yeah, I don't think it turns people off. I think people are desperate for it. Well, it's it's a different day now [[01:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=4735.08s)]
*  It's a different age and it's funny because I just did Bert Bert's podcast and his is a lot bigger than yours [[01:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=4741.0s)]

*  Trying to incite something [[01:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=4758.16s)]
*  You are a little bit and you are not like it. I was getting the yeah, I was getting it. I like it [[01:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=4760.400000000001s)]

*  But it was so great cuz Bert it was so refreshing cuz he's like, oh you wrote a book on spirituality. That's so cool. Um [[01:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=4768.76s)]

*  It was [[01:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=4785.12s)]
*  So cool to hear that from like a top comedy guy who was just able to just say [[01:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=4788.2s)]
*  You know, it's a different it's a different time right now [[01:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=4794.64s)]
*  And I think cuz things aren't working out so well and we see big problems and people are turning and and this is what [[01:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=4797.08s)]
*  soul boom is about I [[01:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=4804.36s)]
*  Want it up on that shelf one of these days. You know what? I'll put it up [[01:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=4806.88s)]

*  I think there's a lot of things we talked about it in here, but I think people are are more open to [[01:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=4823.5599999999995s)]
*  spiritual ideas because the other you know political [[01:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=4828.92s)]
*  Solutions and economic and legislative kind of it's not working, you know, it's not work [[01:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=4833.04s)]
*  Things are breaking down and people feel that right. It's let us down [[01:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=4838.179999999999s)]
*  You know, I think it's you know people used to feel a sense of purpose more [[01:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=4841.44s)]
*  We're talking about this a few weeks ago with the school shootings and stuff [[01:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=4844.66s)]
*  I think some of the reasons why you get these folks is you have people that have no sense of purpose, right? [[01:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=4848.0s)]
*  They don't get it through their job anymore because it's a lot of big companies and there's not the the place in your town that makes like [[01:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=4852.44s)]
*  You know your favorite shoes. My dad works at the shoe company [[01:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=4859.0s)]
*  We wear the shoes my dad makes and there's a sense of pride that like a place was connected to a product [[01:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=4861.86s)]
*  Yeah, you know and it was in your part of your personality was in it you went into work because you knew your kid was [[01:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=4867.28s)]
*  Going to be wearing the thing and you wanted to have a you wanted to fucking get home and [[01:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=4872.28s)]
*  Have a sense of something in the home when you got there, you know [[01:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=4876.2s)]
*  And just like there's no sense of purpose through work. A lot of people don't have a family [[01:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=4880.12s)]
*  They're not in love or loved and so you don't have a sense through love of purpose [[01:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=4884.76s)]
*  But I may add to that [[01:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=4890.32s)]
*  Okay, and this is has to do with religion like so much of America has turned away from religion and so many young people [[01:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=4891.68s)]
*  Have and for a good reason there's been a lot. There's a lot of [[01:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=4898.280000000001s)]
*  Shitty things about organized religion. Oh a lot of pervs out there a lot of you know, a lot of big dogs [[01:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=4901.92s)]
*  You know touching kiddos and you know being molesters, you know [[01:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=4908.0s)]
*  Yeah, yeah and also like church can be very judgmental [[01:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=4912.56s)]
*  You know of people, you know gays and lesbians and and whatnot and they can it can it can you know [[01:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=4916.679999999999s)]
*  cause a lot of disunity in in ways, but we people have also lost purpose as they've lost their sense of [[01:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=4924.08s)]
*  the community that [[01:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=4931.599999999999s)]
*  religious faith can give you know, because what does religion give you it gives you community a [[01:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=4933.679999999999s)]
*  shared sense of purpose, you know transcendence love like [[01:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=4939.76s)]
*  Service like service projects, you know, I have friends that are part of churches or in my own Baha'i faith [[01:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=4944.72s)]
*  You know going out and doing service projects on the weekend together working together side by side praying together common prayer [[01:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=4950.48s)]
*  singing together right potlucks like just like there's [[01:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=4957.48s)]
*  We've jettisoned everything having to do with religion, but there are a lot of positives that come from that world [[01:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=4962.44s)]
*  Oh potlucks alone pretendants having to pretend somebody's casserole is good to their face, dude [[01:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=4969.5199999999995s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, and the good casseroles are taken like right off the bat [[01:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=4974.08s)]
*  Oh, yeah [[01:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=4979.24s)]

*  people need hope it's a precious and depleted resource and [[01:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=5360.5599999999995s)]
*  There's a lot of pessimism out there and we got it we got to turn that [[01:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=5365.48s)]

*  Make people believe that there is a bright day [[01:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=5371.88s)]
*  There is a Star Trek future for humanity where we can all get along and work together and solve problems and make [[01:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=5374.16s)]
*  The world a better place we do it. We start small we start on a podcast you start in a family [[01:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=5381.36s)]
*  You start in a cul-de-sac and you spread out from there and then you bring it to your workplace [[01:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=5386.08s)]
*  But we're not gonna do it with the the way the current media system is and we're not gonna do it with the way that [[01:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=5391.2s)]
*  the current political [[01:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=5396.719999999999s)]
*  Partisan politics system works in our country. It's uh, it's killing us. Yeah, I'm honest [[01:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=5398.44s)]
*  well, some of it could be changing me one thing that's waving podcast started was because [[01:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=5404.0s)]
*  People felt like they couldn't get through into like sitcoms talented comedians felt like they couldn't get opportunities [[01:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=5409.06s)]
*  You know, I'm not saying just me but even like predecessors in podcast sure they wanted to have a place to have a voice [[01:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=5415.5s)]
*  right, yeah, because even acting is just a way you want to be able to have a [[01:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=5421.22s)]
*  Place to put yourself in the world. Yeah, you want to be able to have a voice even if it's a physical voice [[01:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=5426.1s)]
*  Yeah, you know [[01:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=5434.18s)]
*  So that's why that started and that's made conversations more long-form and been able to get [[01:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=5436.26s)]
*  people's points across like I remember seeing Bernie Sanders on Joe Rogan, right and [[01:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=5442.780000000001s)]
*  I've always been of the ilk that I think they should have to have one candidate [[01:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=5448.54s)]
*  You shouldn't be able to pick up if you're Republican [[01:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=5453.22s)]
*  You shouldn't be able to pick a Republican vice president [[01:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=5455.58s)]
*  You should have to have a Democratic vice president right and vice versa so that that way you're always in contention of of idea [[01:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=5457.54s)]
*  Yeah, so you have to figure out the best idea between the two of you in order to get it enacted or move it forward [[01:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=5463.9s)]
*  Right force people to work together right like I would have loved probably a Trump [[01:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=5470.06s)]
*  Bernie ticket right [[01:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=5475.3s)]
*  Because thing you're right. You're gonna see two totally throttle each other. They wouldn't been at each other [[01:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=5477.38s)]
*  I agree Trump would have crushed him like a like a stick insect and that would have just cost them the [[01:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=5482.1s)]
*  Possibility of maybe getting elected but you would have had to see two guys that were different have to figure it out together [[01:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=5487.84s)]
*  right [[01:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=5492.98s)]
*  But um [[01:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=5494.98s)]
*  Yeah, but I remember listening to Bernie Sanders on Joe Rogan [[01:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=5496.38s)]
*  It was the first time I got to hear him in a long for that in here a clip that the media say I didn't [[01:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=5498.66s)]
*  Hear like a two-minute rebuttal on a [[01:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=5502.0599999999995s)]
*  Joe Rogan is four and a half hours long so you can do yeah, you were there [[01:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=5504.98s)]
*  Yeah, put it on when you go to sleep and you wake up and still on you'd love being in there man [[01:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=5508.9s)]
*  Have you ever been on there? No, man. It would be you guys would have a really neat conversation. I don't I don't smoke pot [[01:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=5513.679999999999s)]
*  I don't do I wasca. What's your point? [[01:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=5518.66s)]
*  But that disqualify me no he doesn't do I was either but he you just have to say I don't wrestle [[01:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=5521.54s)]

*  Yeah, and we got a taxi over there to go look and it was just um [[01:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=6111.66s)]

*  The oven on the conveyor belt and it comes out done. Oh, yeah, that's how that's how they used to do it [[01:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=6149.3s)]
*  I think that they always do it that way. It was like the little rolling thing [[01:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=6155.02s)]
*  It was just like kind of like these things and it just kept moving forward [[01:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=6158.34s)]
*  Yeah, but used to be a pretty long oven. Is it really short now or something? I think it was a long oven [[01:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=6161.26s)]

*  Don't know if it's still there. I think it's a Thai restaurant now speaking of Asian people. Oh, yeah [[01:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=6176.700000000001s)]
*  They'll start a restaurant in a Ballinger Way Asian people good they'll start a restaurant in anything [[01:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=6181.5199999999995s)]

*  Let's close down God, but you know what just look under images and see if they have any let's get an old image of it [[01:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=6201.96s)]
*  Somebody took a snapshot of it there. There you go on the left probably it right there [[01:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=6207.400000000001s)]

*  God, it was so small three cylinders. Oh and [[01:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=6219.8s)]
*  One of the sellers was just us in the back seat going [[01:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=6223.72s)]
*  And she could beat us from that like the front seat was so close to she could beat everybody like she was playing the drums [[01:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=6227.04s)]
*  Why don't they have cars with pedals like Flintstones kind of but like just to get like a two-cylinder car [[01:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=6232.4s)]
*  Yeah, but then everyone in the back seat is doing this [[01:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=6239.599999999999s)]
*  Kind of and you get your workout. We're also fat. Yes Americans like [[01:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=6244.08s)]
*  Right win-win [[01:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=6249.36s)]
*  Well, that's almost an example of everything that we've been talking about like are some of the stuff that would help solutions [[01:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=6251.04s)]
*  Humanity okay is if we every there was some sense of a need for a vested interest and if people [[01:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=6257.339999999999s)]
*  Felt like they were contributing, you know, right? [[01:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=6264.82s)]
*  Yeah [[01:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=6269.219999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I mean [[01:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=6270.419999999999s)]
*  It's tough, you know with this broken political system. I think you know in my [[01:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=6272.62s)]
*  Faith traditions called the Baha'i Faith. Mm-hmm. There are [[01:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=6278.5s)]
*  Elections and it's kind of like a 12-step meeting it's it's a little different but you elect [[01:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=6282.9s)]
*  What's called a local spiritual assembly to go to guide the affairs of your local community? [[01:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=6290.139999999999s)]
*  And every year you do that and you write down names silent ballot and you pray and meditate you think who's the wisest most mature? [[01:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=6295.179999999999s)]
*  people to kind of help [[01:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=6304.099999999999s)]
*  Steer forward the Baha'i community here in Los Angeles or whatever you ponder it [[01:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=6306.5s)]
*  And there's maybe a master list of everyone who lives there and you write them down and there's no campaigning [[01:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=6312.02s)]
*  There's no yard signs. There's no money spent. No one says I think I would make a good assembly member and here's why [[01:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=6316.620000000001s)]
*  It's all done silently and then you put them in the envelope and then the tellers count them and then nine people are elected [[01:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=6323.42s)]
*  Like why couldn't you do that in a small town? Could you do that in Covington, Louisiana? [[01:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=6330.9400000000005s)]
*  Yeah, could you have people like no campaigning no one no proselytizing no aggrandizing [[01:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=6334.0599999999995s)]
*  no one saying like I should be the the mayor or what have you and and just have people gather at the local high school football [[01:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=6340.62s)]
*  stadium and [[01:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=6346.94s)]
*  Write down who they think would best serve the affairs of the people of Covington, Louisiana [[01:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=6348.5s)]
*  Yeah, I think that it that that could happen, you know, I think it's probably and obviously it's you know [[01:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=6354.54s)]
*  Hypothetical because you look at a you know, obviously America is much bigger [[01:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=6359.78s)]
*  But yeah, you start to think what system could be different. I think a lot of people are wondering now what system could be different [[01:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=6363.94s)]
*  I think a lot of people think that it's the system we have is isn't helping us [[01:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=6369.92s)]
*  You know, I think [[01:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=6375.18s)]
*  Yeah, you start to wonder how could it be because I'm glad you're saying that because it's it really is like we keep slapping [[01:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=6378.22s)]
*  Band-aids on a broken system and if the system is broken, it's it's no good [[01:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=6384.26s)]
*  You know, it's like well, we'll change this policy [[01:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=6388.66s)]
*  We'll pass this bill or we'll get an increased funding for this and it's just like slapping band-aids on you know [[01:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=6391.0599999999995s)]
*  On a boat full of buckshot. Well, I think you have to have guys maybe possibly you have to have someone's they always that you hear [[01:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=6397.34s)]
*  Anyway that electing an independent candidate getting one of them into the runoff would shake up the [[01:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=6403.76s)]
*  Fuck the way that the funds are distributed. You also have some interesting guys now like Bobby Kennedy jr. Right? Yeah, so he's [[01:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=6409.58s)]
*  He is a Democrat but he has his [[01:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=6417.1s)]
*  His anti vaccine, but he's anti. Yeah, he's like [[01:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=6420.3s)]
*  Yeah, he's anti. Is he an anti-vaxxer? [[01:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=6423.740000000001s)]
*  He raised a lot of great the ton of concern about but I think he was anti-vaxx before kovat [[01:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=6428.34s)]
*  I think he's like he's an environmentalist. So he's always been about the environment. He's always been about let's test things before we move them forward [[01:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=6433.96s)]
*  Right. I mean he has a book. He's against dr. Fauci, you know, so it's like he's definitely in that world [[01:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=6439.740000000001s)]
*  right [[01:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=6445.7s)]
*  But it's interesting because he's gonna run the Democratic ticket, right? I think you're starting to get [[01:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=6447.7s)]
*  Hopefully you're gonna start to get candidates that are different [[01:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=6452.94s)]
*  It's got to start to expand at some point because it feels very railroaded [[01:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=6455.82s)]
*  But isn't and that's true [[01:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=6460.179999999999s)]
*  Like if if we opened it up and you had like let's say you had Joe Rogan run or you had Mark Cuban run or you know [[01:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=6461.5s)]
*  Some really interesting kind of thought leaders or yes manner entrepreneurs. That's cool [[01:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=6467.84s)]
*  But the system is still [[01:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=6473.0199999999995s)]
*  I want the power. I'm gonna raise a shit ton of money. I'm gonna go around doing all these fundraising dinners [[01:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=6475.82s)]
*  I'm gonna be spending all these money on these media outlets [[01:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=6480.92s)]
*  Because I want the power for me and my coterie and we're gonna try and put down you and your little coterie of friends [[01:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=6483.58s)]
*  We're still in that mode where we're not really in the mode of public service, you know, they're public servants [[01:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=6490.16s)]
*  They should be serving the public. So how do we just get out of that whole? [[01:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=6496.98s)]
*  Campaigning thing [[01:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=6501.46s)]
*  Altogether is what I say now [[01:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=6502.98s)]
*  maybe I'm being naive and people are probably rolling their eyes and like oh you hippie, you know, but [[01:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=6504.42s)]
*  But no, it's okay to have that's a great it's a I agree because people are sick of all the wasted money the fucking bullshit the [[01:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=6511.22s)]
*  desperation by these parties to get your vote the pandering to poor people with fear videos and all of this and using [[01:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=6519.62s)]
*  classes and cultures as [[01:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=6527.3s)]
*  Puppets and keeping people in certain places just so they'll continue to vote for you. Like I think everyone's exhausted [[01:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=6529.46s)]
*  I think the heart of the world is [[01:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=6536.58s)]
*  You know has arteriosclerosis [[01:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=6540.26s)]
*  You know it feels that way and that's okay [[01:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=6542.54s)]
*  Look if that's okay if you and I are sitting and talking about that and I like that your book makes me think about that [[01:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=6545.58s)]
*  Yeah, you know and not just the negative sides of it or the problems [[01:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=6550.62s)]
*  Yeah, but um, but I talk at the end of my book [[01:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=6554.360000000001s)]
*  I have a chapter called seven pillars for a spiritual revolution and I offer some tangible [[01:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=6557.18s)]
*  Solutions some things and one of them is what we talked about before which is hope and I said foster joy and squash [[01:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=6563.66s)]
*  Cynicism because as long as we stay cynical and pessimistic nothing gets done if everyone's sitting back just like oh, it's a pile of shit [[01:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=6571.26s)]
*  It'll never work. Whoa, like the nothing will change and it's just gonna get worse actually [[01:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=6578.5s)]
*  That's a really deadly trap and it's it's super important that we you know, we as entertainers as storytellers [[01:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=6584.66s)]
*  you know, we try and foster joy and people give them hope and [[01:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=6591.900000000001s)]
*  Don't let ourselves get cynical. Mm-hmm. You get cynical sometimes you fight on you fight against cynicism [[01:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=6597.9800000000005s)]
*  Oh, yeah, I battle the dark arts. I battle self-pity sometimes which is a unique way that uh [[01:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=6603.9400000000005s)]
*  Cynicism kind of sneaks into you. I find yeah, you know is me just that you know [[01:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=6609.38s)]
*  So I just have to stay stay stay on top of it. Yeah, you know and [[01:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=6614.5s)]
*  It's a misery brigade. Yeah, it does and it does get to be there, you know to me and yeah [[01:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=6618.78s)]
*  Yeah, but there's a lot of people doing good stuff out there and that's another way to look at things and to wake up and think hey [[01:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=6623.820000000001s)]
*  You know, there was a guy I wrote about this guy my book [[01:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=6632.02s)]
*  This guy named Callum Grieves and he works with Greta Thunberg and a lot of youth ambassadors for climate change [[01:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=6636.54s)]
*  And whatever you think about Greta Thunberg putting that aside [[01:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=6643.18s)]
*  Really brilliant guy and he said to me, you know, I work on [[01:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=6646.200000000001s)]
*  clean air [[01:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=6651.62s)]
*  Because everyone can agree on clean air some people on this side of the political spectrum might not think that [[01:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=6653.26s)]
*  Man-made co2 is causing climate change or that it people are being extremist and and whatnot and people on this side [[01:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=6658.900000000001s)]
*  You know have different opinions, but clean air is something everyone can get behind [[01:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=6666.42s)]
*  Yeah, you know you reduce you don't want kids to get an asthma right you want your grandkids to have clean air [[01:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4nzA1an0mE&t=6671.099999999999s)]
