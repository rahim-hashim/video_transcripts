# Arctic Biologist Seth Beaudreault  This Past Weekend w Theo Von #221
**Theo Von - This Past Weekend:** [August 08, 2019](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc)
*  Today's guest is an Arctic biologist who has come down directly from the Great White North [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=0.0s)]
*  to let us know exactly what's going on and to answer some questions we have about, well, all sorts of stuff. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=8.4s)]
*  We're going to get into nature, we're going to get into the depths of the cold and Alaska. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=15.700000000000001s)]
*  Today's guest is Mr. Seth Boudreau. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=20.6s)]
*  So do you just come from Alaska? [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=30.0s)]
*  Right now, coming from Costa Rica back up to Alaska. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=40.8s)]
*  I just went down to see my lady and spent some time at my place, kind of in the middle of the work season. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=44.8s)]
*  Okay. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=49.8s)]
*  So basically five months a year in Alaska, May through September, studying migratory birds and wildlife, [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=50.8s)]
*  and then the rest of the year I'm down in Costa Rica. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=56.400000000000006s)]
*  And yeah, because you sent me a picture from, you sent me a picture one time of lunch, I guess it was, [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=59.8s)]
*  and it was some iguana claws. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=66.8s)]
*  You guys had a batch of iguana. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=68.8s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=70.8s)]
*  And I was like, dang, bro. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=72.0s)]
*  Yeah, my lady's dad traps them in the yard and cooks them up. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=74.0s)]
*  And it's not that great. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=78.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=80.4s)]
*  Yeah, if you're in a tight spot, someone will go and get you through. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=81.2s)]
*  Well, yeah, I saw it looked, when I looked at them, and we'll have Nick put the picture up too, [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=84.4s)]
*  but they looked, I'd have thought you'd have eaten a different part of the iguana. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=90.4s)]
*  I'd never really considered really the claw. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=96.4s)]
*  Yeah, it was kind of all chopped up in there, but they're mostly bones, so it probably looked like a pot full of claws. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=98.4s)]
*  Yeah, that's what it looked like. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=104.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=106.4s)]
*  When you cook them up, how do you even cook those? [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=108.4s)]
*  I think you cook them in a pressure cooker with a chopped tomato and some garlic and onion maybe, some chicken bouillon. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=111.4s)]
*  Pretty simple. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=119.4s)]
*  You can cook it the same way you cook chicken. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=120.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=122.4s)]
*  But it's not that great. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=123.4s)]
*  Is it like an island treat kind of? Is it pretty common there in Costa Rica? [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=125.4s)]
*  No, I think a lot of rural people eat it occasionally, but a lot of people think it's gross and definitely don't eat it too. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=128.4s)]
*  Oh yeah, it's kind of interesting. It's almost like when I was growing up, people would eat a lot of hogshead cheese and stuff. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=137.4s)]
*  Where my sister lived, they cooked cracklins a lot of times where they'll just take a bunch of fat and put it in a pot. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=144.4s)]
*  That's the best. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=151.4s)]
*  At the beginning, you're like, where's the meat? And then by the end, you're just like... [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=152.4s)]
*  Left with these pieces of fried leather. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=157.4s)]
*  Oh, and they look... Yeah, and they're just turning tasty really and hairy. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=159.4s)]
*  They're almost like the inverse of cotton candy. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=162.4s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=167.4s)]
*  Cracklins. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=168.4s)]
*  Pretty far on the other end of the spectrum. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=169.4s)]
*  So when you go to Alaska, what part of Alaska are you in? [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=171.4s)]
*  In the Arctic, so north of the Brooks Range. I'm at a science station. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=176.4s)]
*  Can you pull that up, Nick, the Brooks Range so we can see that? I just want to have an idea where you are. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=180.4s)]
*  Yeah, about 370 miles north of Fairbanks. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=185.4s)]
*  Yeah, and I don't even know where Fairbanks is, dude. How far from Phoenix is what I want to know? [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=189.4s)]
*  Give me an idea. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=194.4s)]
*  The state looks like this, you know? These are the Aleutian Islands. Fairbanks is kind of right in the middle, and I'm up towards the top there. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=195.4s)]
*  Okay. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=202.4s)]
*  Yeah, so I'm above north of that mountain range. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=203.4s)]
*  Oh wow. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=206.4s)]
*  So that's called the North Slope up there. That's where there's a lot of oil business going on in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=207.4s)]
*  So you are up there. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=215.4s)]
*  Yeah, it's about a 10 hour drive to get up to where I work. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=218.4s)]
*  And if you go off the top, say you get to the top of Alaska and you take a boat north, what do you hit? The North Pole? [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=221.4s)]
*  Eventually some ice. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=228.4s)]
*  Really? [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=229.4s)]
*  Yeah, and you can't really access the coast there without paying for a permit from the oil company to go on a tour. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=230.4s)]
*  You can go on like an hour long tour where you get to dip your toes in the Arctic Ocean, but they don't want people messing around up there. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=238.4s)]
*  So you can't just access it on your own. They kind of own the whole north coast line there. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=245.4s)]
*  So it's private property? [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=250.4s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. There's a town called Dead Horse up there. It's not really much of a town. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=253.4s)]
*  It's like an industrial outpost where everything's made of metal and there's just testosterone in the air. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=257.4s)]
*  Dang. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=263.4s)]
*  It's a rough place. It's ugly. But you can see some cool birds up there, spectacle lighters and phalaropes and king-ighters and stuff. It's pretty cool. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=264.4s)]
*  Now are those birds that are in there, they're only there? [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=273.4s)]
*  Spectacle lighters, yeah, are real Arctic specialists. They didn't even really know where they spent the winter until pretty recently. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=276.4s)]
*  The whole population goes to like an opening in the ice out in the Bering Sea, I think. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=283.4s)]
*  How do you say it? Spectacle lighter? [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=288.4s)]
*  Spectacled eider. E-I-D-E-R. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=290.4s)]
*  And when you're up there, how close do you get into these birds? What are you doing? [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=293.4s)]
*  Too close. My job, I'm a naturalist for the science station up there, and so every day I'm out there just trying to document what's happening with wildlife, [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=298.4s)]
*  when the bird species arrive to the area, when they leave in the fall, and then other wildlife. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=308.4s)]
*  There's bears and wolves and wolverines and stuff up there. So I'm just out there spending time trying to see what's going on and document it just for posterity, basically. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=314.4s)]
*  Oh wow, that's a beautiful bird. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=323.4s)]
*  Isn't that crazy looking? [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=325.4s)]
*  Yeah, so it's a sea duck, and they just breed on the coast in grassy ponds and then spend the winter out among the sea ice and openings. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=327.4s)]
*  Can you get a picture of the head again, Nick? [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=336.4s)]
*  Look at that thing. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=340.4s)]
*  Wow. Yeah, and so what is that coming off the back? It almost looks like gills up there by its head. Is that? Or what is that? Is that just feathering? [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=341.4s)]
*  Yeah, just weird feathers. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=349.4s)]
*  And can you have one of these at the house, or these more? [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=351.4s)]
*  These, you've got to get some special permits for that. Yeah, they don't take kindly. I think it's a threatened species, probably. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=354.4s)]
*  There's just not that many of them, and they breed in really specific areas. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=361.4s)]
*  And can you watch them fight or they don't fight? What do they do? [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=365.4s)]
*  They seem pretty docile to me. They're just kind of sitting around on the water minding their own business. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=368.4s)]
*  Arctic summer is really short, and so the birds kind of have to get there and get on with it, get the breeding done, and then get the hell out of there. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=373.4s)]
*  So, and that's when a lot of them do breeding is in the summertime? [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=382.4s)]
*  Yeah, pretty much only then. So we have like 110 species of birds we've observed in the area that are coming from the lower 48 states, Central America, South America, even all the way down to Antarctica. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=385.4s)]
*  Wow. Someone will spend the winter down there. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=398.4s)]
*  So birds kind of just come, like everybody's kind of popping in. Yeah, yeah. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=400.4s)]
*  Who's kind of the randiest group, you know? Because sometimes you're like going on a plane to Vegas and you got different groups. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=403.4s)]
*  You got a couple of German guys, you know? You got one guy making his own cocaine in the backseat. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=408.4s)]
*  You know, you got a bunch of Italians just drinking deca 200. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=413.4s)]
*  What kind of group gets up there and just really just turns it out? [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=419.4s)]
*  There's a bird called the blue throat that is mostly a Eurasian bird, and the population just barely extends over into Alaska. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=423.4s)]
*  So if you want to see them in the United States, you have to go up there. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=431.4s)]
*  And they, yeah, look at that. They sing bird karaoke. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=435.4s)]
*  They do like imitations of other bird species and they'll do this repertoire that goes on for they can imitate up to like 25 species of other birds. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=440.4s)]
*  But you hear so you hear it. You hear them singing all this stuff, but it sounds a little off like karaoke where you're like, I don't think that's really the White Crown sparrow. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=448.4s)]
*  And it's that guy. Oh, and so they're just kind of they're like impersonators. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=457.4s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, totally. And yeah, the females seem to get a kick out of the male with the biggest repertoire. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=462.4s)]
*  And oh, wow. Pretty cool, huh? Yeah, it's cool. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=467.4s)]
*  So bird bird like going to be like, I'm going to go up there and now can they will they tempt other females from other species to come on over with since they're using different people's songs? [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=473.4s)]
*  I haven't seen them tempt females, but other species will definitely get agitated if they hear another bird singing their song because they when birds sing, they're basically advertising their territory. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=483.4s)]
*  So they sing on the edges of their territory and then the bird with the next territory over will hear it and he'll kind of establish his border. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=494.4s)]
*  So they suddenly hear their own song in a place where they thought they had their territory staked out. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=502.4s)]
*  Some of them definitely respond aggressively. So it's so when a bird like sings, it's it's always to let people know that this is my territory that and I'm available. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=507.4s)]
*  So they're singing to let the females know that they've got this pad and they're ready to roll. OK, yeah. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=519.4s)]
*  So I got a comfortable place here. I got a little spot at the days in or whatever. Got me a little spot at the Hampton in for the summer. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=525.4s)]
*  I got out. Yeah. So those are the only two reasons if you hear a bird, they're letting somebody know about their territory or they are letting females know that they're available. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=533.4s)]
*  Yeah, pretty much. Yeah. And do is it just male birds that sing or female birds also sing mostly just male birds sing and females do little calls that they use to keep in touch with each other and to warn each other and predators and stuff. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=542.4s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. Waiting for this one bitch to text me back right now. It's only been two weeks. So she's probably busy, you know, traveling or something. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=556.4s)]
*  Yeah. How cold. So when you get up to Alaska, man, how cold is it like because people think of Alaska and, you know, like a lot of people you think of like gold country and that sort of thing. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=566.4s)]
*  You think of it being cold. Is there a level where it doesn't matter that it's cold anymore that you can't even like we can't even really feel a difference between, say, you know, 20 degrees below and like 80 degrees below 20 degrees below is not bad at all. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=579.4s)]
*  When you get down to 40, I think 50 below is the lowest I've experienced. And then you're just in pain. You just don't want to be outside at all. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=593.4s)]
*  And yeah, so down to minus 20, it's very dry up there, at least in Fairbanks. And so you can still go skiing and stuff and have an all right time. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=602.4s)]
*  But when it gets colder than that, like you can feel a breeze coming underneath the bottom of your cabin door just because the temperature difference is so great that the air is just like blowing in trying to equal it out. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=614.4s)]
*  So explain that to me like I don't know what you're saying exactly. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=627.4s)]
*  When there's differences in temperature, the air wind is basically air moving from one place to another. Right. Okay. A ridiculously simple way to describe when. Yeah, I get it. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=631.4s)]
*  I think we all understand that. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=642.4s)]
*  But now we do. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=644.4s)]
*  But like when there's a big difference inside and outside, the air is trying to equalize to normal it out. Okay. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=647.4s)]
*  So you have these like 10 inch thick walls of a cabin or even the doors are usually have several inches of insulation. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=654.4s)]
*  But just at the bottom, the only space where there's a little bit of air, it's just blowing in like your pants will go like this in the wind if you're standing near the door. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=661.4s)]
*  Because the air is coming in. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=671.4s)]
*  It's so much colder outside than it is inside if you have it at 60 inside that it just creates wind just trying to rush that close to each other. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=673.4s)]
*  But when I get up there in early May and that's when it's still winter a little bit, there's usually a few feet of snow on the ground, but it's already full daylight. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=682.4s)]
*  So I don't see the sunset until September. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=693.4s)]
*  So the sun's up the whole time when you get there from there. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=699.4s)]
*  Yep. Yeah. Which, yeah, as I get older, it gets harder to be used to that. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=702.4s)]
*  Like we have blackout curtains, you know, to try to make it dark in my room and stuff, but it's you can't keep it out the light a little bit. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=707.4s)]
*  So yeah, it's kind of still winter a little bit in early May and that's when the birds start to arrive to the area. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=715.4s)]
*  So I'm out there all day, like just visiting the same types of habitat and trying to keep track of when each species arrives to the area. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=721.4s)]
*  Like a concierge almost. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=728.4s)]
*  Just trying to help them get settled in. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=730.4s)]
*  So you do that for years and years and years and then you have a nice record of exactly what was happening, you know, in any given year. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=732.4s)]
*  And you can track changes over time and that's kind of how the good kinds of science work where you're just, there's people studying really specific stuff up there about carbon release into the atmosphere and all that. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=741.4s)]
*  But I'm just studying very basic like what are the animals doing. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=754.4s)]
*  Right. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=757.4s)]
*  I really love that because I've just always been more of a generalist where I like being outside and just paying attention to stuff rather than have my nose in the tundra sniffing gases or whatever they're doing. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=758.4s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=769.4s)]
*  Yeah, it's not that you're not as much of a corporate hunter. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=770.4s)]
*  Right. Yeah. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=773.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=774.4s)]
*  Freelance. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=775.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=776.4s)]
*  When you start to see like different patterns from birds, is there a time when you like really start to get scared? [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=777.4s)]
*  Like is there one species that you really start to pay attention to? [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=784.4s)]
*  Yeah, there's a couple times the birds have frightened me a little bit. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=788.4s)]
*  There's a bird called a long-tailed Jaeger that it's a sea bird basically. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=792.4s)]
*  It's kind of like a ghoulish ternish type of bird, but they're a predatory sea bird. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=798.4s)]
*  And they only come inland to breed on tundra. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=803.4s)]
*  Yeah, that one. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=807.4s)]
*  Oh, wow. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=808.4s)]
*  So they eat voles and lemmings and stuff. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=810.4s)]
*  And when there aren't a lot of lemmings or voles around, those populations kind of crash occasionally. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=813.4s)]
*  And when there's not any around, they'll just form groups of like 40 and just maraud around. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=818.4s)]
*  And one time I saw a group of 40 just coming over a hill and there was kind of a thunder cloud in the distance. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=823.4s)]
*  And I was like, I didn't know that they did that yet. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=828.4s)]
*  It's like, why are these 40 birds coming at me? [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=830.4s)]
*  It's pretty gnarly. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=833.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=834.4s)]
*  You thought maybe they teamed up when we're coming to get you. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=835.4s)]
*  I thought there was a tsunami coming or something. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=836.4s)]
*  Oh, wow. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=838.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=839.4s)]
*  You just spend enough time out there, you see weird things like that that most people don't know happen. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=840.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=846.4s)]
*  I mean, animals are so in tune with Mother Nature, they're almost like they're working for Mother Nature or something. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=847.4s)]
*  Yeah, I guess. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=855.4s)]
*  Or like you could get clues from them. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=857.4s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, definitely. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=859.4s)]
*  I learned a lot about us from watching them. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=860.4s)]
*  And I think that's one of the great things about doing that kind of work is just being out there and having the opportunity to be away from all the other noise that's going on and just watch other things and have time to think. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=863.4s)]
*  And yeah, I've been doing it for 17 years now. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=876.4s)]
*  So like ever since I've been an adult. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=880.4s)]
*  And is it a lifestyle that you think you could get away that you would want to go away from? [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=883.4s)]
*  Or do you start to like look forward? [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=887.4s)]
*  I mean, do you really just look forward to that time up there? [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=889.4s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=891.4s)]
*  I mean, I'm away from my girlfriend, fiance for those five months, which is why I go down and visit in the middle of that for 10 days. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=892.4s)]
*  So it's really great to see her. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=901.4s)]
*  And that's a cost, you know, like it's definitely an alternative lifestyle. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=903.4s)]
*  And a lot of couples, I don't think it pull it off long distance relationship, but we've been going nearly six years now and it's great. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=907.4s)]
*  I would love it, man. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=914.4s)]
*  Oh, God, I can't see you for four months. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=917.4s)]
*  Yeah, I love you, though. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=921.4s)]
*  For me, it'd be great. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=925.4s)]
*  I mean, yeah, it would just be I think it's almost something I'm gonna have to have in my life. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=926.4s)]
*  I'm trying to think of like something I think about like how quiet does it get? [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=932.4s)]
*  It must get extremely quiet, huh? [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=937.4s)]
*  It gets so quiet that you can hear your own heartbeat like in your ears. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=939.4s)]
*  Yeah, where there is no other sound, especially when there's no wind or anything. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=943.4s)]
*  And you don't. Yeah, being here, I'm in the belly of the beast here. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=948.4s)]
*  Yeah, especially LA. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=952.4s)]
*  Yeah. Oh, my God. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=953.4s)]
*  Oh, my God, flying in. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=954.4s)]
*  Everybody else seems to think it's fine, but I'm looking out there like this is so wrong. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=956.4s)]
*  Now, when you say that, is it just like the amount of people, the amount of like goings on in one space, like the lack of space? [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=962.4s)]
*  Yeah, just humans living so out of balance with nature and just everything that's here, we depend on someone else somewhere else making and doing, you know, like it's kind of weird. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=969.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=982.4s)]
*  And I don't think it's good for us really, like having watched animals for so long, you kind of realize like we are just another animal. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=983.4s)]
*  We are an ape. We're not special. We're not even domesticated. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=993.4s)]
*  Like we're as wild as we ever were. We just have changed our habitat a lot, you know, to suit us. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=997.4s)]
*  But it comes at such a great cost that when you're outside of this stuff and have the peace and time to kind of get out of it and then you come back to it, it's pretty shocking. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=1003.4s)]
*  Wow. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=1015.4s)]
*  Yeah. But it's like, you know, if you're in a bad relationship and your buddy could come up and tell you why you should get out of it, you can listen and it makes logical sense maybe, but you come up with excuses for why you're just not going to do it yet. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=1016.4s)]
*  And then years later when you do, you look back and you're like, what the hell was I thinking? [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=1031.4s)]
*  Yeah. That's what's going on. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=1035.4s)]
*  Yeah. Just because I had that chance to be outside of this human civilization kind of. And so you get a different perspective, I think. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=1037.4s)]
*  But I can't expect to make people understand that in the same way that when you're in a bad relationship, like someone could explain something perfectly. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=1046.4s)]
*  You can't see it. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=1055.4s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=1056.4s)]
*  Yeah. It's hard to see something when you're in it. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=1057.4s)]
*  Yeah. So it's nice to like down in Costa Rica, you know, I'm living in a tiny little village, 200 people, and there's no other gringos around except for a couple of families of Mennonites. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=1058.4s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=1071.4s)]
*  But like, yeah. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=1072.4s)]
*  They're wild, huh? [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=1073.4s)]
*  They're baking over there. They've got a little bakery and they're pretty interesting. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=1074.4s)]
*  They called, I got a Facebook message from someone I didn't know the other day saying the Mennonites want you to call them. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=1080.4s)]
*  Gang, bro. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=1087.4s)]
*  And I'm like, what do the Mennonites need me for? [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=1088.4s)]
*  Dude. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=1090.4s)]
*  And it was a bird identification question. They saw a bird that wasn't in the book. And I'm like, yeah, it's a southern reference. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=1091.4s)]
*  Getting ready for Thanksgiving over there with those minnows, man. It's beautiful. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=1097.4s)]
*  And they're pretty self-sufficient, those cultures, aren't they? Like Mennonites and Amish? [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=1101.4s)]
*  In a way, yeah. The Mennonites are kind of weird where they use cell phones. They don't use the internet, but they'll use cell phones. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=1106.4s)]
*  They use motors. They're not like the Amish in that sense. They're really nice, but you feel a little weird around them because the women are covered, you know, from head to toe. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=1113.4s)]
*  And I kissed an older Mennonite lady on the cheek by accident because that's a custom in Costa Rica when you say goodbye to someone. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=1123.4s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=1131.4s)]
*  And as I got closer, I kind of realized like she doesn't want this to happen, but I'm in too deep. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=1132.4s)]
*  Oh, yeah. That's most of it. It's a lot of Gianni and Nick sexual history. Yeah. A lot of that going on in here. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=1137.4s)]
*  But yeah, so being in these quiet places, it's great when people visit. Like I've got a lot of good buddies I grew up with who have come down to the place in Costa Rica. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=1145.4s)]
*  Just to hang out in Alaska. Oh, to Costa Rica. [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=1154.4s)]
*  Few have come up to Alaska, but I don't get that much time off up there. So yeah, my seven months a year off is down in Costa Rica, and that's where people come visit and can kind of like, I think they, before they visit, they imagine me laying in a hammock on the beach drinking imperial or something. [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=1155.4s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=1171.4s)]
*  When they come down and see we're living in like a really small rural agricultural village where growing coffee. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=1172.4s)]
*  You got to do a lot of stuff. There's a lot of action. [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=1177.4s)]
*  Yeah, which is that's kind of the best way we can be is just doing work that's meaningful to you to people around you. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=1179.4s)]
*  Yeah, I can imagine the exchange, the human exchange you get by helping others or being part of a small community. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=1188.4s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, that's how we're evolved to be, you know, like, we're supposed to be living in tribal groups of, you know, up to 100 or 150. And then we, we've gotten so far away from that that I don't think we can see our way back. [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=1195.4s)]
*  But do you think there could be a correction that happens that brings us back like sometimes I feel like that's the thing that I wonder like this Mother Nature finally be like, all right, enough of this Sims bullshit, you know, about to tighten up the shit. [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=1210.4s)]
*  I think is unavoidable. It happens to every other species on Earth. Every other species population goes up and down and up and down. [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=1223.4s)]
*  Really? [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=1230.4s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, like links and snowshoe hares, their populations kind of follow each other as the hair population gets high, the links start producing more kittens and then start eating all the hairs and start dying off and then the links have to die off. [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=1231.4s)]
*  Everything else goes like that. And if you look at a graph of the human population since like 1700, we've just gone in climate and we've done it by, you know, like advances in agriculture and medicine and everything, which some of them are great. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=1246.4s)]
*  But we can't keep going forever. [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=1260.4s)]
*  Yeah, like how sustainable is it? [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=1263.4s)]
*  It's not at all. So that's hard to watch happening like and that no one gives a shit. [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=1265.4s)]
*  Right. [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=1272.4s)]
*  Like, I'm lucky the time I've had to be out in the wild and get that perspective, but it makes it harder to be in the civilized world because no one else like knows what the hell I'm talking about. [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=1273.4s)]
*  Right. [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=1286.4s)]
*  Oh yeah, you start to look like an alien. [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=1287.4s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=1289.4s)]
*  Start to seem like something that's it starts to seem like you're the odd man out. [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=1290.4s)]
*  Right. Exactly. [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=1293.4s)]
*  Or when really it's the it's kind of the other way. I mean, I think especially in America, we don't notice that there's more like rural living in a lot of other cultures. [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=1294.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=1303.4s)]
*  We don't realize that like in the whole globe that there's tons of it going on. [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=1304.4s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. Like when people are talking about how we're going to have smart cars driving everybody around here, the rest of the world has no idea that's even being discussed. [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=1308.4s)]
*  Right. [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=1318.4s)]
*  Except for in big cities, maybe. But like, yeah, it's not. [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=1319.4s)]
*  Yeah, it's funny. I go to Illinois like in the summer and they have a small town up there and they don't even get 4G. [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=1321.4s)]
*  Like it's 3G is what you get on your phone. So it's like if you want to watch a video, dude, you got to drive with your buddy, you know, 19 minutes, you know, and park outside the McDonald's. [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=1328.4s)]
*  That's enough fricking phone heat. So it's like those people aren't even worried about it's more like an agricultural environment in that in that area. [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=1338.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=1347.4s)]
*  They're not worried about it. [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=1348.4s)]
*  Everybody else looks down on them, you know. [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=1349.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=1351.4s)]
*  Like they produce the food we eat. They do all this stuff that we kind of tried to get away from having to do ourselves. [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=1352.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=1359.4s)]
*  And then we look down on them. It's so wrong. [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=1360.4s)]
*  It is crazy. I mean, especially like a lot of like media and stuff these days. [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=1362.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=1365.4s)]
*  You know, I mean, even Alaska, I'm sure. I mean, CNN hates anything that's white, it seems like. [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=1366.4s)]
*  So I'm surprised that they even surprised and not Alaska deniers. [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=1371.4s)]
*  But um, but yeah, it is. I guess it's like, I mean, you have such an interesting insight into that because you get to see what it's like. [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=1376.4s)]
*  You're almost living in two different realms. [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=1384.4s)]
*  Totally. Yeah. Yeah. And just occasionally passing through this one and just being like, what the hell is going on? [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=1386.4s)]
*  Wow. [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=1392.4s)]
*  Because your layovers are here on the way on your way back to Costa Rica. [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=1393.4s)]
*  Basically between these two kind of remote areas, I passed through places like this. [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=1397.4s)]
*  And so I'm away for long enough where things have changed since I last came through and I can see them. [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=1402.4s)]
*  And most of them are alarming. [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=1407.4s)]
*  Wow. [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=1409.4s)]
*  Like the Uber drive over here is scary than any bear encounter I've ever had. [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=1410.4s)]
*  I agree. That's a good call. [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=1414.4s)]
*  I mean, like it's way more dangerous being on a highway here than being up there. [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=1418.4s)]
*  And now, so do you just, you must notice so many just like small, like, do you notice that you are alarmed at a personal level or do you notice that you are alarmed at a natch at a level of like, you know, tension in your body or things like that, that from being in the city, like for on the Uber drive, for example. [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=1424.4s)]
*  Yeah, both for sure. [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=1442.4s)]
*  I definitely feel way more in danger just because we're supposed to know everybody that we interact with. [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=1444.4s)]
*  That's how our brains have been for hundreds of thousands of years. [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=1451.4s)]
*  So to be in a place where I've got a couple buddies I grew up with that I visit when I'm here, other than that, everybody's a stranger. [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=1454.4s)]
*  And yeah, it is kind of wild to think of how many strangers you run across and run past. [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=1463.4s)]
*  Yeah. So, and like people are great generally, but you just, I think evolutionarily in the back of your mind you're not at ease, or at least I'm not, you know. [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=1468.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=1478.4s)]
*  And I think, you know, we're an ape, but we're obviously super adaptable. So most people have adapted to deal with that pretty fine. And yeah, not me. [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=1479.4s)]
*  Do you feel like we're definitely apes? You have no doubt about it? [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=1490.4s)]
*  No doubt. Yeah. Anybody who thinks we're not just hasn't thought about it enough, I think. [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=1493.4s)]
*  But don't you think, man, you got to think if we're an ape, like I've never looked at an ape, like for example, I've never been to the zoo and been like, you know, missed the old place, you know. [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=1499.4s)]
*  Like nowhere in my body does that reflect. And I'm not saying, I think maybe we might be monkeys that God created, you know. [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=1510.4s)]
*  Like I think maybe, I mean, do you think we're really an ape? Like, because- [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=1518.4s)]
*  Have you ever smelled your armpit like after a nice hike? [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=1524.4s)]
*  Yeah, a little bit when I was younger. Yeah. [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=1528.4s)]
*  You know? I mean, I get the hang of it now kind of, but, ah. [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=1530.4s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, like you watch how we behave in groups and- [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=1535.4s)]
*  Very much like apes? [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=1540.4s)]
*  Exactly, as apes. Like it's a miracle anytime we act above an ape, I think. It's a miracle. [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=1541.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=1548.4s)]
*  And it doesn't happen that often. [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=1549.4s)]
*  Oh, I am, the more that I always try to give people the benefit of the doubt and then I'll go around to different places, then I'm like, damn, it's really hard to keep doing this. [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=1551.4s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=1560.4s)]
*  You know, people, like we will constantly let each other down. [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=1561.4s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, it's terrible. But that's because there's so many of us so crowded in that we don't mean anything to each other. [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=1564.4s)]
*  Right, yeah, and that's a great statement. That's exactly what I feel like here all the time. [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=1571.4s)]
*  Yeah. So when you're in a small community where you're kind of interdependent, that's how we're programmed to function. [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=1575.4s)]
*  Like in a group of apes, non-human apes or human apes, like everybody's supposed to have a role. [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=1582.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=1590.4s)]
*  And everybody kind of does something that contributes to the group every day. [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=1591.4s)]
*  So in larger cities, you have a lot of people that they don't, they may have a role, but they're, it's not as prominent or it's not as defined or maybe they can't find their role. [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=1595.4s)]
*  Yeah, it's, yeah, we're set up. [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=1607.4s)]
*  You probably then create a lot of depression, I would bet. [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=1609.4s)]
*  Exactly, yeah. So it's not surprising to me at all how much depression there is and how people are so disconnected. It's totally logical. [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=1611.4s)]
*  Right. Because we're in, I like thinking about this, this is interesting. [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=1620.4s)]
*  Yeah, because in cities, it's so funny when I go home or I go someplace else, even when I go to other places in the US even, I just feel somewhat, the second I leave here, I feel so much more relaxed. [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=1624.4s)]
*  Yeah? [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=1633.4s)]
*  Yeah, man, it just, I just feel better. [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=1634.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=1636.4s)]
*  You know, I just feel like, yeah, I don't know, I just don't feel like, I have to just, I feel like I have to fight so hard here to just be a person. [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=1637.4s)]
*  Yeah, you do. [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=1646.4s)]
*  And it's just taxing after a while. [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=1648.4s)]
*  It's real frenetic here. There's no quiet. There's no darkness at night. There's all the light pollution. [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=1650.4s)]
*  Like, it's so against how we're, how we spent so much time being just in this recent fraction of modern times is the only time we've got. [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=1657.4s)]
*  That we're like this. [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=1667.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=1668.4s)]
*  Yeah, it's gotten so fast too. [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=1669.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=1670.4s)]
*  What do you think are going to be some of the side effects of some of this that we're going to see? [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=1671.4s)]
*  I mean, obviously we're seeing a lot of now with like depression, you know, people not feeling like they fit into the world, which makes sense. [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=1673.4s)]
*  It's like, how could you feel like you fit in when there's so many people all clogged together and our genetics haven't really caught up to this, this new way of living? [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=1679.4s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah, I don't know, man. That's the thing is I have no answer for it. [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=1689.4s)]
*  Even after all this time, it still boggles my mind and I see no way out of it other than just each person trying to do good things where they can on a scale that they can see the results of. [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=1696.4s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=1711.4s)]
*  You know? So like these, we always think of these problems as big global issues, but they're local issues. [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=1712.4s)]
*  Right. [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=1719.4s)]
*  Just piled on top of each other and they're all results of individual people's decisions, you know? [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=1720.4s)]
*  So like. [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=1725.4s)]
*  Yeah, I think that way all the time. [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=1726.4s)]
*  Yeah, you can't solve a big global issue. You can just see work that needs to be done, do it, and hope that you live to see the results or that your kids do or something. [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=1728.4s)]
*  But even that, we're being an ape, we're not programmed to think that far. [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=1738.4s)]
*  Possibly be an ape. [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=1744.4s)]
*  Yeah, it's still effort of ape. [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=1745.4s)]
*  I mean, it's just like, here's the thing, dude. I've never seen an ape and been like, oh, yeah, you know? [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=1747.4s)]
*  Really? [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=1752.4s)]
*  My buddy. [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=1753.4s)]
*  Really? [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=1754.4s)]
*  No, no, I haven't. [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=1755.4s)]
*  You got to you got to go to the zoo again, man. [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=1758.4s)]
*  But I've been over there, man. [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=1760.4s)]
*  I've been over there, but I've never seen an ape yet. [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=1762.4s)]
*  Not once have I looked at an ape and been like, oh, man, yeah, wonder what the boys are up to. [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=1765.4s)]
*  Fuck. No, man. [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=1771.4s)]
*  I'm not saying that it's not a possibility, but now what? [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=1773.4s)]
*  But you're out in nature, you're out in like really you're out in the expanse of probably some of the most beautiful places you could probably see. [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=1778.4s)]
*  Is that true or is it just disgusting? [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=1786.4s)]
*  Like is it barren up there and like is it miserable? [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=1788.4s)]
*  It's both. [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=1791.4s)]
*  OK. [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=1792.4s)]
*  Yeah, like the mosquitoes in Alaska in the summertime, I don't know if you know, but it's insane. [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=1793.4s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=1797.4s)]
*  Like you have to wear. [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=1798.4s)]
*  That's not a racial story. He's talking about the actual animal. [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=1799.4s)]
*  Yeah, you have to wear head nets and stuff. [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=1802.4s)]
*  Really? [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=1804.4s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=1805.4s)]
*  But there's no humidity, right? [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=1806.4s)]
*  It's pretty dry. [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=1808.4s)]
*  But with all the snow melt that melts in the spring and the mosquitoes have laid their eggs in those areas and they kind of start hatching out. [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=1809.4s)]
*  There's videos that have been shot up where I work where you will not believe the amount of mosquitoes. [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=1819.4s)]
*  So you got to go to Jefferson Paris, dude, in Louisiana. [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=1824.4s)]
*  They have debt. [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=1827.4s)]
*  I mean, we'd go toe to toe with you. [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=1828.4s)]
*  Contest. [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=1830.4s)]
*  Yeah, we bring our mosquitoes and you bring yours. [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=1831.4s)]
*  And we watch them fight or something over there in Reno. [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=1834.4s)]
*  Then they hybridize. [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=1836.4s)]
*  Yeah, look at that. [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=1837.4s)]
*  We have it. Wow. [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=1838.4s)]
*  Oh, my God. [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=1841.4s)]
*  This looks like a big orgy or something. [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=1845.4s)]
*  It is. Yeah. Yeah. [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=1847.4s)]
*  But so like. [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=1849.4s)]
*  But hold on a second, because there's two things. [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=1850.4s)]
*  There's two things. One are mosquitoes like little bitty birds under their insects, but are they similar to birds or not? [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=1855.4s)]
*  They fly and some people say it's the Alaska State bird, you know, some bumper stickers. [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=1860.4s)]
*  OK, that's evidence. [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=1865.4s)]
*  But as far as like genetically and like, are they similar? [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=1866.4s)]
*  Not really. No. [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=1871.4s)]
*  OK. Kind of buzzkill a little. [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=1874.4s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=1878.4s)]
*  Wow. Nick, like spicy there today. [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=1881.4s)]
*  No pun intended on the buzzkill, man. [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=1885.4s)]
*  That's good. Yeah. [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=1887.4s)]
*  And some I repeated it because some of us are still didn't get it. [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=1888.4s)]
*  That's the only reason. And I don't think if I fully got it. [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=1892.4s)]
*  Yeah. But that's a fair point. [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=1894.4s)]
*  Like there's great beauty up there. [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=1897.4s)]
*  It's magnificent. [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=1899.4s)]
*  But wouldn't that beauty make you think like, OK, there's a higher power. [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=1900.4s)]
*  There's something creating. [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=1903.4s)]
*  I mean, yeah, there's something. [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=1904.4s)]
*  There's something bigger going on, something creating all this. [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=1905.4s)]
*  Yeah, I don't know. [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=1908.4s)]
*  I just with that question, I always just end up saying I don't know and I don't know if it even matters. [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=1909.4s)]
*  Like here we are. [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=1914.4s)]
*  Right. Right. [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=1916.4s)]
*  It's a good point. Yeah. [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=1917.4s)]
*  Like basing your whole existence on that seems kind of intense. [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=1918.4s)]
*  Yeah. I'm thinking that you know which one of the many thousands of answers is the right one. [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=1922.4s)]
*  It's kind of weird. [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=1926.4s)]
*  But do you but when you when you're in some of those spaces and it's so natural and it's so quiet and you have the ability to even hear your own heartbeat. [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=1929.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=1936.4s)]
*  Like it must be like almost like a really intense meditation that goes on at like a core level or at like a level of even your your cells that you can't even really fathom probably a level of like peacefulness and stuff. [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=1937.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=1949.4s)]
*  Do you does that make you feel like like what insight do you get to is there like something bigger going on here or is there do you feel like a part of something bigger or do you just feel like really small? [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=1950.4s)]
*  Does it? [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=1965.4s)]
*  You you definitely feel more part of the big picture but you also feel small small because you are a tiny part of a giant picture. [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=1966.4s)]
*  Right. [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=1976.4s)]
*  So because especially if you're studying nature and stuff like that you're really I mean you're right there on the food chain. [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=1977.4s)]
*  I mean you're basically. [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=1982.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=1983.4s)]
*  You know. [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=1984.4s)]
*  And yeah I've been charged by the policy in the food chain really. [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=1985.4s)]
*  I've been charged by bears muskox. [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=1988.4s)]
*  I had the incident with a swan you know. [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=1991.4s)]
*  Now we say you had an incident with a swan. [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=1994.4s)]
*  I mean I've had I've had I mean I've had a couple I had some fucking shit go off in Oregon one time but you know I was trying to jog in these doing some of those animals group up they get real violent. [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=1996.4s)]
*  They do. [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2008.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2009.4s)]
*  It's like in teeth almost. [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2010.4s)]
*  You know. [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2011.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2012.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2013.4s)]
*  They definitely find strength in numbers. [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2014.4s)]
*  And you you really you went toe to toe with the swan up there. [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2016.4s)]
*  I went hand to neck with this one. [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2020.4s)]
*  You killed it. [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2022.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2023.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2024.4s)]
*  Choked it out. [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2025.4s)]
*  And boy that's what I'm saying do poor a over could be bro. [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2026.4s)]
*  That's where I'm going with right there. [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2029.4s)]
*  Nearly got the best of me though. [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2031.4s)]
*  Really. [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2032.4s)]
*  They're they're like this tall. [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2033.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2034.4s)]
*  And the wings are probably more than six feet across. [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2035.4s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2038.4s)]
*  And yeah. [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2039.4s)]
*  Jesus. [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2040.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2041.4s)]
*  So and what do they do how do they come in like what's their attack. [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2042.4s)]
*  They're mostly body work. [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2044.4s)]
*  Is it really. [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2046.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2047.4s)]
*  How is that not a fucking sport. [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2050.4s)]
*  There have been so many dude I remember they used to have this group in a you know I use [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2053.4s)]
*  this term I don't know loosely or however I use it but they used to have a group that [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2056.4s)]
*  would come through our college in town called it was fag fistfights right. [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2060.4s)]
*  And it was gay men that would fistfight each other in a boxing ring and you'd pay for it [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2064.4s)]
*  at the bar you pay six dollars or something you got a beer and you got to watch these [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2068.4s)]
*  guys go at it. [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2071.4s)]
*  And. [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2073.4s)]
*  But I would pay anything to watch you know. [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2074.4s)]
*  A biologist and a and a and a four and a half foot swan. [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2079.4s)]
*  Figuring things out go toe to toe. [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2084.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2086.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2087.4s)]
*  What's so a lot of do they strike at you what do they do they nip at you with the beak. [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2088.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2091.4s)]
*  I got it by the neck right away. [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2092.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2094.4s)]
*  So it couldn't get me with the beak but it was hissing at me. [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2095.4s)]
*  Nick wants to bet on this. [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2097.4s)]
*  Nick wants to bet on fights. [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2098.4s)]
*  And the fact that it went to the body first that's always the best. [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2100.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2103.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2104.4s)]
*  I was I was taking a back. [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2105.4s)]
*  But. [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2106.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2107.4s)]
*  So I had it by the neck and it was beating me with its wings. [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2108.4s)]
*  And it's kind of disorienting. [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2111.4s)]
*  It knows that's a good term disarray. [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2112.4s)]
*  So does it feel like painful or does it feel like scary. [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2114.4s)]
*  Kind of scary just because I thought you know I had shot it once and that was the last bullet [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2117.4s)]
*  we had. [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2123.4s)]
*  Where do you shoot it. [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2124.4s)]
*  You just shoot a point blank or how do you shoot. [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2125.4s)]
*  No it was in the it. [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2126.4s)]
*  It was in the back. [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2127.4s)]
*  Jesus Christ dude. [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2129.4s)]
*  Like the coward of Jesse James. [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2131.4s)]
*  Have you seen that movie. [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2132.4s)]

*  I know but dude we hadn't we had no more food and we had another week to go out there. [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2137.4s)]
*  So what are you going to do. [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2141.4s)]
*  Look I feel you. [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2142.4s)]
*  What is the assassination of Jeffy James. [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2144.4s)]
*  By the coward Robert Ford. [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2146.4s)]
*  Yeah I know I'm not proud. [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2148.4s)]
*  I'm not proud. [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2150.4s)]
*  He shot him in the back. [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2152.4s)]
*  It was trying to get away. [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2155.4s)]
*  But. [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2157.4s)]
*  So your food was that vital at that point. [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2158.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2159.4s)]
*  I mean we had this guy this pilot was supposed to fly over a drop off to dry bags full of [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2160.4s)]
*  food and he was supposed to get 100 feet off the water but because of the weather he was 500 feet up. [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2165.4s)]
*  So these dry bags hit the water exploded. [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2171.4s)]
*  Denzel Washington right there. [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2173.4s)]
*  I've seen that. [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2175.4s)]
*  So all we could salvage we ran out into the river and trying to grab what we could but it was going away pretty quickly. [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2176.4s)]
*  We got a small bottle of whiskey that the pilot had included for us just to be nice. [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2182.4s)]
*  Wow. [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2187.4s)]
*  And a couple fruit cups. [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2188.4s)]
*  And so and so that's your that's your rations for the for what the next week. [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2190.4s)]
*  It would have been. [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2194.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2195.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2196.4s)]
*  A week and a half I think. [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2197.4s)]
*  So now you're like damn. [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2198.4s)]
*  Yeah we're in trouble. [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2199.4s)]
*  So and we were you know probably a couple hundred miles outside of Fairbanks I think. [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2200.4s)]
*  So there's no getting out of there. [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2205.4s)]
*  And we're up a tiny little river where you have to float all the way down to get to a place where a plane a float plane can come get you. [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2208.4s)]
*  And so yeah we just had to start hunting grouse and geese and ducks and whatever there was. [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2215.4s)]
*  But we had a limited we weren't planning on hunting. [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2221.4s)]
*  We have guns for bear protection so we didn't have that many bullets you know. [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2224.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2228.4s)]
*  So you had to. [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2229.4s)]
*  Did you guys miss a couple times or you know. [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2230.4s)]
*  No no we're pretty good. [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2233.4s)]
*  And is it a pistol you walking right up on them and shoot them in the back or is it. [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2235.4s)]
*  No it was a shotgun. [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2238.4s)]
*  OK. [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2239.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2240.4s)]
*  Jesus man. [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2241.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2242.4s)]
*  And we're kind of makes me sad a little. [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2243.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2245.4s)]
*  Some grouse out there chilling dude you know maybe having a cigarette or just relax. [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2246.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2250.4s)]
*  Looking at the foliage. [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2251.4s)]
*  Yeah thinking of my own land one day and you just come up and blow them in the back. [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2252.4s)]
*  They're grouse aren't that smart like yeah I've hunted them before and they'll get into a tree and they don't realize that they don't blend in with the tree. [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2258.4s)]
*  They blended in when they were on the ground but then they're in a tree and you can see that they're blending. [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2266.4s)]
*  They think they still blend in and they're like I see you. [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2271.4s)]
*  That's the story of my life. [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2274.4s)]
*  They think they're all slick looking at you. [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2277.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2280.4s)]
*  Now what about the fox man we had a fox in school when I was young and somebody stole it right. [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2281.4s)]
*  And I knew I knew it was going to happen. [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2285.4s)]
*  But but what about the fox. [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2288.4s)]
*  Are they out there. [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2291.4s)]
*  Yeah there's red foxes up there the occasional Arctic Fox. [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2292.4s)]
*  Wow. [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2295.4s)]
*  And here man. [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2296.4s)]
*  They're cool to see. [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2297.4s)]
*  You watch them hunting voles through the snow in the spring and they're walking along on top of the snow and then they'll cock their head and kind of trying to get the fox. [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2298.4s)]
*  And kind of triangulate the sound they're hearing the bull moving under the snow. [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2306.4s)]
*  Then they pop up into the air and dive into the snow and probably six times out of 10 they come up with the bull. [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2310.4s)]
*  It's like Iwo Jima dude. [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2317.4s)]
*  Have you guys seen that D-Day or whatever. [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2318.4s)]
*  That's insane man. [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2323.4s)]
*  Is that one of the is that one of the most unique hunting techniques that you see out there. [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2324.4s)]
*  Definitely. [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2327.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2328.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2329.4s)]
*  That's one of the few species I've actually got to see hunting even all this time up there. [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2330.4s)]
*  I've seen wolves chasing a caribou once. [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2333.4s)]
*  Look at that fox and they're good jumpers. [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2335.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2338.4s)]
*  People don't realize that they're like the Greg Luganus of like the animal kingdom. [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2339.4s)]
*  Look at that. [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2344.4s)]
*  So they hear the the rodent under the snow. [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2345.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2349.4s)]
*  And then they get that lift in his head. [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2350.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2351.4s)]
*  Damn. [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2352.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2353.4s)]
*  They triangulate the location and then I don't know how they do that math in their head. [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2354.4s)]
*  Wow. [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2359.4s)]
*  It's pretty wild. [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2360.4s)]
*  Now what are some of the larger animals that you'll see up there in the area that you're [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2361.4s)]
*  in? [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2364.4s)]
*  Grizzly bears. [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2365.4s)]
*  The occasional moose, muskox, caribou. [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2366.4s)]
*  Those are the big ones. [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2369.4s)]
*  Which one is the most friendly do you find to like to humans or even maybe overall do [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2371.4s)]
*  you or can animals do someone can seem friendly like a dog can seem real friendly. [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2376.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2380.4s)]
*  Are any of those larger animals you see up there friendly. [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2381.4s)]
*  You can trick them to come closer to you by putting your arms up and it kind of looks [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2385.4s)]
*  like a pair of antlers and either their eyesight is not that good or they're not that bright [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2390.4s)]
*  but they'll start walking towards you wondering if they're going to fight you or try to copulate [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2394.4s)]
*  or. [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2400.4s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2401.4s)]
*  It's like a trunk uncle almost. [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2402.4s)]
*  I feel like I see like a little. [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2403.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2406.4s)]

*  They're just eating vegetation and staying put pretty much. [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2418.4s)]
*  They don't move a lot. [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2422.4s)]
*  Do you get a sense of of an eye like do you get a sense of like what the ice age was like [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2424.4s)]
*  and stuff when you're up there like you start to get like a sense of like wow what people [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2431.4s)]
*  have gone through over history and stuff like that. [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2435.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2437.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2438.4s)]
*  You'll find not only fossils from 300 million years ago of coral and stuff when it used [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2439.4s)]
*  to be under the ocean up there. [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2444.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2446.4s)]
*  But then you'll also very rarely find artifacts from native folks from 10,000 years ago or [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2447.4s)]
*  whatever. [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2453.4s)]
*  I found a little spearhead sitting on top of this little knoll. [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2454.4s)]
*  I went up there because it was looked like a good viewpoint and I'm sitting there looking [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2458.4s)]
*  for animals and stuff and then I see sitting next to me this spear point. [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2462.4s)]
*  I thought it was someone else thought it was a good viewpoint also 10,000 years ago. [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2466.4s)]
*  No one else went up there since. [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2470.4s)]
*  Wow. [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2472.4s)]

*  Yeah. [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2485.4s)]
*  Very long. [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2486.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2487.4s)]
*  And then you go back to the station and eat ravioli lose a kid. [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2488.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2493.4s)]
*  You cut that microwave and it really shuts down those inner beacons huh. [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2494.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2499.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2500.4s)]
*  I guess it's like it's hard to not be stuck sometimes though in this society that we're [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2501.4s)]
*  in though. [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2505.4s)]
*  That's the thing that you blame humans. [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2506.4s)]
*  Do you blame businesses? [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2507.4s)]
*  Do you blame is there any blame? [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2508.4s)]
*  Is it just the like where we are kind of like and this isn't everyone obviously this is [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2511.4s)]
*  more cities than rural areas. [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2516.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2517.4s)]
*  I think it's the natural tendency for most animals to try to make their situation easier. [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2518.4s)]
*  Not necessarily better or maybe in a certain definition but easier like if a dog gets unlimited [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2524.4s)]
*  food they'll might just eat themselves into obesity right. [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2532.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2535.4s)]
*  And it's not good for them but they might if they could articulate their thoughts they [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2536.4s)]
*  might be like well it's all this food would be good if I ate it you know maybe there won't [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2541.4s)]
*  be later. [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2544.4s)]
*  So I think every little incremental change along the way has seemed like a benefit to [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2545.4s)]
*  us and it has been in a sense but there are always unforeseen effects that come off of [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2552.4s)]
*  it that you can't predict and by the time they're really prevalent you're already too [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2558.4s)]
*  far used to the thing that you can't really think about going back you know what I mean. [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2563.4s)]
*  Ah yeah. [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2568.4s)]
*  Yeah if you get used to like doing Halloween and they tell you no. [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2569.4s)]
*  Yeah exactly. [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2572.4s)]
*  You're going to be like you're still going to be you'll lay on the porch forever you [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2574.4s)]
*  know just expecting candy. [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2577.4s)]
*  Yeah yeah yeah. [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2578.4s)]
*  Yeah so that's the hardest thing is like. [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2580.4s)]
*  I can totally see that and it's really interesting because then even as humans we have the addictive [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2582.4s)]
*  personality. [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2587.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2588.4s)]
*  We have the ability the easy ability to like that sugar lizard that just gets with you [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2589.4s)]
*  know just grasp the easiest first thing. [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2592.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2595.4s)]
*  It's like you really have to fight that instinct these days in order to get to a more natural [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2596.4s)]
*  state. [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2602.4s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2603.4s)]
*  Of yourself. [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2604.4s)]
*  Yeah and most people aren't interested in that at all like would never spend five minutes [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2605.4s)]
*  even thinking about it. [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2609.4s)]
*  Right. [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2610.4s)]
*  Isn't that baffling sometimes. [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2611.4s)]
*  It is yeah. [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2612.4s)]
*  Because I think a lot of times that we're all on this struggle where we're trying to [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2613.4s)]
*  we're trying we're trying our best you know. [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2616.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2619.4s)]
*  We know that some of the stuff you're saying we get it we can feel it you know we know [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2620.4s)]
*  that I'm taking these easy way outs here and there and I know it's not benefiting me at [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2623.4s)]
*  a level inside of me but but then you see some people and you're like oh they don't [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2628.4s)]
*  they don't stand a chance. [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2634.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2635.4s)]
*  Not this maybe their next generation or two might but whoever this person is you know [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2636.4s)]
*  I've seen some people wandering around a gas station sometime like oh this dude you know [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2641.4s)]
*  he'll stay in here forever dude. [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2645.4s)]
*  He's going to eat one of those hot dogs. [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2646.4s)]
*  Yeah bro. [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2648.4s)]
*  He's going to eat 100 of them. [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2649.4s)]
*  You know this dude will be in here forever. [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2650.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2652.4s)]
*  You know this dude will lay on the grill after a while. [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2653.4s)]
*  I think it is a tanning booth. [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2654.4s)]
*  Oh he's going to change his name to Frank. [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2655.4s)]
*  Yeah it just never ends bro. [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2657.4s)]
*  This dude will feed himself to his own family like you know what I'm saying like it's just [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2658.4s)]
*  you meet people that are like and it's not their fault really it's just maybe where they [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2662.4s)]
*  are genetically. [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2665.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2666.4s)]
*  It's like oh they're. [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2667.4s)]
*  Or it's the culture where if everybody's doing this one thing it's so hard to go against [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2668.4s)]
*  the grain and that's that's the biggest part of the trouble is that the way I talk about [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2672.4s)]
*  things a lot of people say like what do you want to go back to the 1700s. [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2681.4s)]
*  No like there were good things we gave up along the way that we shouldn't have given [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2684.4s)]
*  up like the great things we've come up with in medicine. [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2689.4s)]
*  Yeah like witchcraft that thing. [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2691.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2693.4s)]
*  To be honest with you. [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2694.4s)]
*  Probably better. [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2695.4s)]
*  I don't know why I keep looking at these guys and not laughing at any of my jokes either. [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2696.4s)]
*  I'm joking you're doing a good job. [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2699.4s)]
*  Gianni's not. [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2700.4s)]
*  Yeah it's true. [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2701.4s)]
*  We've created a real totalitarian environment that we're not very proud of sometimes. [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2702.4s)]
*  But so isn't it crazy to think then that like we're it's like survival of what will be [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2709.4s)]
*  the fittest then moving forward is it people that are able to realize that that the first [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2720.4s)]
*  like not to give in to all the comforts that are able to have some awareness. [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2728.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2732.4s)]
*  Or what is the next survival of the fittest because survival of the fittest used to be [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2733.4s)]
*  it was the strongest. [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2735.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2736.4s)]
*  Right. [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2737.4s)]
*  And it was sometimes the craftiest too. [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2738.4s)]
*  Yeah definitely. [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2739.4s)]
*  But you had to also like you had to align yourself with somebody that was strength because [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2740.4s)]
*  you would need that. [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2743.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2744.4s)]
*  Support. [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2745.4s)]
*  But now I'm wondering what it's becoming in our society in America anyway. [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2746.4s)]
*  Yeah I feel like we're adapted to get the next generation going but not really anything [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2750.4s)]
*  beyond that which logically we shouldn't be programmed to think that far into the future [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2756.4s)]
*  because every other animal just tries to get the next generation out and then they've done [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2761.4s)]
*  their part you know. [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2766.4s)]
*  Forget what the hell is where it was going with that. [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2767.4s)]
*  That's fine. [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2771.4s)]
*  That is me in the middle of every sentence. [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2772.4s)]
*  Imagine running in with a room to tell people something they forget what it was. [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2774.4s)]
*  Just looking excited. [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2778.4s)]
*  That's how I feel every single sentence. [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2779.4s)]
*  It's like it's going to be good. [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2780.4s)]
*  And then you just stand in there with a murder weapon in your hand. [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2783.4s)]
*  You're like fuck man. [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2787.4s)]
*  I need a preposition. [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2788.4s)]
*  You know it's a little alarming. [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2790.4s)]
*  What do you what do you what do you guys get over here. [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2792.4s)]
*  Nick. [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2795.4s)]
*  Johnny what's going on. [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2796.4s)]
*  When you're up in Alaska away from people that long and then you come back do you find [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2797.4s)]
*  it hard to communicate with people. [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2802.4s)]
*  A little bit. [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2804.4s)]
*  Yeah I think because I work alone most of the time up there and I have my thoughts you [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2805.4s)]
*  know on tumble dry up top. [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2810.4s)]
*  Yeah it can be weird trying to articulate these kind of ideas I guess. [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2813.4s)]
*  But yeah. [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2819.4s)]
*  People seem stupid. [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2821.4s)]
*  That's a good question. [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2823.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2824.4s)]
*  Do people seem to when you come back to us like when you come back to like you know. [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2825.4s)]
*  No like it's not stupid at all because you guys are well adapted to your situation right [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2828.4s)]
*  you know like maybe not long term as a species but everybody's just kind of doing what they [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2835.4s)]
*  got to do you know. [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2841.4s)]
*  And L.A. is a short term environment. [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2843.4s)]
*  It has it must I feel like it screams that. [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2845.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2847.4s)]
*  Like people are here passing through to get enough to get to the next whatever they would [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2848.4s)]
*  rather be doing or an environment that would be more comfortable. [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2852.4s)]
*  It's really a almost a for all for the entire world. [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2855.4s)]
*  This is almost just like an airport it feels like it is. [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2858.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2861.4s)]
*  You know it even never ends. [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2862.4s)]
*  It feels like we're still in this like a very far terminal the airport right here or a [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2863.4s)]
*  podcast and even when I'm at my apartment it feels like that. [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2867.4s)]
*  I'm like man I just never leave the airport. [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2870.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2872.4s)]
*  You know it just never ends here. [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2873.4s)]
*  What is amazing about L.A. is how quickly you can get way away from here like the hike [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2874.4s)]
*  went on yesterday with my buddy up in the San Gabriel Mountains I guess. [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2880.4s)]
*  Is it Eagle Rock or something? [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2885.4s)]
*  It was Dawson Saddle up to Thoop Peak I think. [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2886.4s)]
*  Damn. [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2891.4s)]
*  Which is up at like nine thousand something hundred feet. [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2892.4s)]
*  It's gorgeous up there. [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2895.4s)]
*  We've maybe passed ten people on the trail in four or five hours and you get up. [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2896.4s)]
*  And to you that was busy. [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2901.4s)]
*  It was yeah it's like this place is. [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2902.4s)]
*  This is bumper to bumper. [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2904.4s)]
*  But you can get up to that peak and look you can have a 360 view of everything way out [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2907.4s)]
*  to I don't know if it's Palmdale where it's just flat desert out that way. [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2912.4s)]
*  I've been to Eagle Rock or something out there before. [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2917.4s)]
*  It was about an hour and 40 minute drive to get out there. [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2920.4s)]
*  But it's it was gorgeous. [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2923.4s)]
*  Was there a chairlift that if you wanted to like it was around there in that area. [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2925.4s)]
*  We passed some chairlifts. [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2928.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2929.4s)]
*  I think I've been up that hike before it's absolutely amazing. [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2930.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2932.4s)]
*  And you can see L.A. in downtown in the distance in the smog and it's just like all of that [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2933.4s)]
*  is happening down there and nobody's up here. [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2938.4s)]
*  It's crazy. [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2941.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2942.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2943.4s)]
*  Some cool birds some dirty bird species up there. [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2944.4s)]
*  Pig me nut hatch. [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2945.4s)]
*  Really. [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2946.4s)]
*  Bush tit. [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2947.4s)]
*  Oh dude. [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2948.4s)]
*  I'll show you some fucking Bush tit right over here off the 101. [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2949.4s)]
*  Williamson's sapsucker. [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2953.4s)]
*  Nick's seen some definitely not on the work computers though. [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2954.4s)]
*  That's the rules we have going on around here. [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2958.4s)]
*  National Geographic. [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2960.4s)]
*  Oh dude. [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2961.4s)]
*  I remember jerking off back in the day to National Geographic. [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2962.4s)]
*  You know there's a dark tit near a fire. [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2965.4s)]
*  You know it's no wonder I ended up like I did. [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2968.4s)]
*  That's a beautiful bird isn't it. [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2971.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2973.4s)]
*  Wow. [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2974.4s)]
*  That's beautiful. [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2975.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2976.4s)]
*  Do you think do you think like do you get a sense when you're up there by other animals [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2977.4s)]
*  that they know that you're a human do they know like do they think that you're like an [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2981.4s)]
*  anomaly or like a abnormality do you think like. [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2985.4s)]
*  It is kind of weird because yeah they're not evolved to know what we are. [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2988.4s)]
*  I guess you know native people have been there for ten thousand years so maybe that's enough [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2993.4s)]
*  for some of them. [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2997.4s)]
*  Most of them run away like they seem to understand that whatever you are it's probably not good. [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=2998.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3002.4s)]
*  But I've had birds but I've had birds laying on my head you know like. [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3003.4s)]
*  Oh that's cool. [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3006.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3007.4s)]
*  So there's some animals that seem to see you as like something to land on I guess. [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3008.4s)]
*  Do you find that animals are still like curious about it like do you find that they're curious [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3012.4s)]
*  a little bit like what are animals like kind of. [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3017.4s)]
*  They're mostly just minding their own business and trying not to get eaten by something you [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3020.4s)]
*  know like you ever watch a bird eating they're just looking up every two seconds like they'll [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3026.4s)]
*  take a bite and then look up and they just can't relax. [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3031.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3034.4s)]
*  So I feel bad for them. [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3035.4s)]
*  And then the migration you know like they migrate using the celestial sky so they orient [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3037.4s)]
*  themselves to the stars and migrate that way. [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3045.4s)]
*  Really. [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3048.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3049.4s)]
*  So they operate totally their migration patterns they base those after looking at the stars [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3050.4s)]
*  and see what's going on. [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3054.4s)]
*  They know where the North Star is and they orient based on that so they have these kind [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3055.4s)]
*  of like tracks in their genetics basically. [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3060.4s)]
*  Some of them have it in there and some of them learn it. [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3064.4s)]
*  But that's it's sad because like all these cities and all this light pollution totally [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3067.4s)]
*  disorients them. [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3073.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3074.4s)]
*  You got a couple of sparrows jerking off outside of Detroit for no reason. [[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3075.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3078.4s)]
*  They got to move it along. [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3079.4s)]
*  But like. [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3080.4s)]
*  But no I could totally imagine that. [[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3081.4s)]
*  Yeah like how we're damaging like how we're like we don't even realize the effects that [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3082.4s)]
*  were happening. [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3087.4s)]
*  Not at all. [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3088.4s)]
*  Yeah because most people never would have a reason to stop and think about it like the [[00:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3089.4s)]
*  Twin Tower Memorial in New York they have these two pillars of light that they put up [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3094.4s)]
*  around that time I think in late September and that's right during bird migration. [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3100.4s)]
*  Oh. [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3105.4s)]
*  And there's videos of literally hundreds and thousands of birds flying around and around [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3106.4s)]
*  and around and falling to their death. [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3110.4s)]
*  And if they see a certain number of birds up there in the lights they'll shut them off [[00:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3113.4s)]
*  for a half an hour. [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3116.4s)]
*  But just that alone is killing probably thousands of birds a year. [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3118.4s)]
*  So that's just that's the kind of. [[00:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3123.4s)]
*  That's a perfect example. [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3125.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3126.4s)]
*  So like we're doing something that we feel like humans doing something we feel like is [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3127.4s)]
*  honoring you know others that it's you know it's it's out of love and support. [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3130.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3136.4s)]
*  And then even in that space we're killing thousands of fucking birds every year. [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3137.4s)]
*  There's a pile on the ground. [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3141.4s)]
*  We're just trying to get to Florida. [[00:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3142.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3144.4s)]
*  Some guys shoveling them into the ditch in the water. [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3145.4s)]
*  Oh sure. [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3147.4s)]
*  But that's the thing. [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3148.4s)]
*  Yeah there's always. [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3149.4s)]
*  Wow. [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3150.4s)]
*  Such an example. [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3151.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3152.4s)]
*  Always unforeseen costs. [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3153.4s)]
*  And I think anytime you can ask yourself what is the cost of what I'm doing or what I'm [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3154.4s)]
*  participating in you find you go further down the line and you realize things that you [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3159.4s)]
*  never would have figured out from the get go and then nobody really talks about. [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3165.4s)]
*  You know it's interesting we think we try and think about that even sometimes just here [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3169.4s)]
*  with podcasts like trying not to sell like bad products to people or like. [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3172.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3175.4s)]
*  That's great. [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3176.4s)]
*  You know we're trying like you know I'm trying to think of what else. [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3177.4s)]
*  I mean I think we try to affect the things that are close to us. [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3180.4s)]
*  But yeah it's interesting it's like as you. [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3185.4s)]
*  It's so weird it's like you grow up or I grew up anyway I guess like you end up in working [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3188.4s)]
*  in a business or in society and it's kind of built where it's like you want to you know [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3194.4s)]
*  achieve things or achieve your goals. [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3201.4s)]
*  And with those it's almost like you don't even realize the side effects that are going [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3204.4s)]
*  on or even the chain that you're that we're a part of the whole system we're a part of [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3208.4s)]
*  isn't even it's not working like very like copacetically with nature all the time. [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3213.4s)]
*  Because we don't have to see the effects of anything we do now like everything happens [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3218.4s)]
*  somewhere else. [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3222.4s)]
*  Some somebody else is doing everything to produce the things that we use and depend [[00:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3223.4s)]
*  on. [[00:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3227.4s)]
*  So back when we were in hunter gatherer groups we saw the effects of everything you did right [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3228.4s)]
*  right in front of you. [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3233.4s)]
*  Yeah you couldn't eat everything there was because then there was nothing left right [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3234.4s)]
*  here we just kind of pretend that there's an endless supply of everything and we create [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3238.4s)]
*  so much destruction with people like Jesus Christ and nature. [[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3244.4s)]
*  Sorry but no you're it's sad I mean it's almost does it get sad a little bit. [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3250.4s)]
*  It's totally sad and that's that's one of the hardest things is like feeling so at odds [[00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3257.4s)]
*  with the rest of how most of society works and kind of feeling like it really shouldn't [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3262.4s)]
*  be like this. [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3267.4s)]
*  But you got to play the game a little bit but right you have to play the yeah we have to [[00:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3268.4s)]
*  play the game some you have to meet people where they are you have to like do you look [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3273.4s)]
*  at society as like is it hard not to look at society is like oh well they're bad people [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3277.4s)]
*  these people that we are bad. [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3282.4s)]
*  It's hard to not think that and that would just be an emotional frustrated reaction you [[00:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3284.4s)]
*  know but I know everybody is in the situation they're in and if I was in a different situation [[00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3289.4s)]
*  I would be I would have you know less freedom to make choices too. [[00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3294.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3299.4s)]
*  And less time to think about it so but that's why like where we live down south that small [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3300.4s)]
*  village where everybody knows everybody and you kind of help your neighbors out you trade [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3307.4s)]
*  bananas and oranges and stuff. [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3312.4s)]
*  Yeah teamwork. [[00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3314.4s)]
*  Yeah we grow coffee and we drink our own coffee you know it's nice to just when you can do [[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3316.4s)]
*  something for yourself do it because it hits this kind of instinctual feeling we have where [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3322.4s)]
*  that was a part of our genetics you know to be. [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3329.4s)]
*  Yeah yeah do you feel like we're far from that if we really tapped into it. [[00:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3333.4s)]
*  I don't know if we are. [[00:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3337.4s)]
*  If we are already too far beyond that or. [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3338.4s)]
*  Right like have we already become too much of like you know zombies you know. [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3342.4s)]
*  I think so like I think every other species gets knocked back down by starvation predation [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3347.4s)]
*  or disease right every single other thing and we keep pushing those things off but we [[00:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3355.4s)]
*  can't do it forever. [[00:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3361.4s)]
*  Yeah that's what I'm talking about. [[00:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3362.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3364.4s)]
*  I'm ready for it man I'm ready for it yeah like if I die in like a big you know thing [[00:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3365.4s)]
*  that's crazy it's like a you know a war for food or something at least it's going to [[00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3369.4s)]
*  be exciting. [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3374.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3375.4s)]
*  It's going to be a good couple hours of television you know. [[00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3376.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3378.4s)]
*  It's going to be. [[00:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3379.4s)]
*  Somebody will be filming it. [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3380.4s)]
*  Yeah somebody will be filming it and even if they're not what an exciting like sometimes [[00:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3381.4s)]
*  I think about that like imagine being in like a real shootout or a real like you know like [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3384.4s)]
*  you see Leonardo DiCaprio fight that bear in the remnants or whatever. [[00:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3389.4s)]
*  Yeah that was very realistic. [[00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3392.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3394.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3395.4s)]
*  I think it's like how great like even it's almost like just to feel that alive for a [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3396.4s)]
*  minute. [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3401.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3402.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3403.4s)]
*  You know I was talking the other day to this UFC fighter and he was telling me like I've [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3404.4s)]
*  seen a picture of him he lost a fighter he'd come in second and I was like man but you [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3408.4s)]
*  still look like you had like gone through something and he's like man it's crazy he's [[00:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3414.4s)]
*  like every fight you go through it's like you come out even if you you don't get the [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3417.4s)]
*  outcome you want he's like you come out the other side there's a you have new revelations [[00:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3421.4s)]
*  about yourself like at a level that you didn't really know. [[00:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3425.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3428.4s)]
*  And that kind of stuff just man it's so enviable then like sometimes just beating this drum [[00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3429.4s)]
*  out here not that our lives are bad or anything obviously you know like you know it's it's [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3434.4s)]
*  comfortable. [[00:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3439.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3440.4s)]
*  Sure. [[00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3441.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3442.4s)]
*  But is it I often wonder if I'm being if I'm very much rewarded at like a level inside [[00:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3443.4s)]
*  of me that is almost like a light that's getting dimmer and dimmer over time because we just [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3448.4s)]
*  keep throwing these like blankets on it you know. [[00:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3454.4s)]
*  I think you do good things you know for the single moms and stuff like that. [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3457.4s)]
*  Oh. [[00:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3462.4s)]
*  You've definitely had an eye for seeing things that you can do that are good and do them. [[00:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3463.4s)]
*  Right. [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3468.4s)]
*  So. [[00:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3469.4s)]
*  Well that's nice you to say that man you know and I'm lucky I got you know Nick and John [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3470.4s)]
*  everybody's super you know we all kind of you know Nick and I have similar backgrounds [[00:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3475.4s)]
*  and some of that and yeah but I think I think even just hearing you say that like you know [[00:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3480.4s)]
*  touch the things that we can that are close to us because I notice what I do notice that [[00:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3485.4s)]
*  I don't like about myself when I start saying oh we all need to be like this it's like when [[00:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3489.4s)]
*  that's when we get preachy and then we just get disconnected. [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3493.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3495.4s)]
*  It's so disconnecting it's like yeah if we're going to solve people always point at the [[00:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3496.4s)]
*  government like if we're going to the government is just us. [[00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3500.4s)]
*  Yeah there are people that. [[00:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3503.4s)]
*  And they're just humans like if something's going to be different we have to make it we [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3504.4s)]
*  have to do it. [[00:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3509.4s)]
*  Yeah it reflects what we said we wanted basically. [[00:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3510.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3515.4s)]
*  So the problem is always down at the individual level. [[00:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3516.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3519.4s)]
*  But it's kind of nice it falls back on us in the end like totally if all these cities [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3520.4s)]
*  burn or if there's an electric outage outer outer edge and we're never able to get it [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3524.4s)]
*  back up or something you know like immediately you really quickly are going to be your your [[00:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3528.4s)]
*  your brain is me asking yourself who am I like a quick turn. [[00:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3534.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3539.4s)]
*  Who are you. [[00:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3540.4s)]
*  What can you do and what can you do. [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3541.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3542.4s)]
*  You can't do anything that's necessary. [[00:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3543.4s)]
*  I'm going to Joe Rogan's bro hopefully dude. [[00:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3544.4s)]
*  I'll be back there to skin and bison for him. [[00:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3547.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3554.4s)]
*  If if something does go down like the power. [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3556.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3559.4s)]
*  You're right. [[00:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3560.4s)]
*  Can you imagine how quickly it would be complete chaos. [[00:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3561.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3563.4s)]
*  Nobody knows how to grow anything. [[00:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3564.4s)]
*  Nobody knows how to fix anything. [[00:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3565.4s)]
*  The water suddenly doesn't come to your apartment. [[00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3567.4s)]
*  Nobody knows how to live like that. [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3570.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3572.4s)]
*  So it's not going to be good and I'm not going to survive it either. [[00:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3573.4s)]
*  Like I can grow some things but not enough to do you go fucking bro. [[00:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3578.4s)]
*  Let's be honest you could rear naked choke a swan. [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3583.4s)]
*  If I can find one. [[00:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3585.4s)]
*  You know it's twice as chance we are me and Nick are eating Gionni. [[00:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3586.4s)]
*  So he's got he's built pretty well. [[00:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3593.4s)]
*  You can see his ass in the movie. [[00:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3595.4s)]
*  Ma if you want to see that movie. [[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3596.4s)]
*  It's a pretty decent movie. [[00:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3598.4s)]
*  But yeah. [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3600.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3601.4s)]
*  There's no reason in the middle of the movie to make John again. [[01:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3602.4s)]
*  I actually have a question. [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3607.4s)]
*  So I feel like a lot of people all the time are like well where do I start. [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3608.4s)]
*  There's so much like I feel like I'm so behind like what's something that someone could start doing like every day like somebody could do something where they could further themselves to help. [[01:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3612.4s)]
*  The environment instead of just destroying it. [[01:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3621.4s)]
*  I think the Amish like you wouldn't want to live like the Amish right. [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3623.4s)]
*  I don't know dude. [[01:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3629.4s)]
*  I like not having a lot of choices bro. [[01:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3630.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3632.4s)]
*  Limited choices dude. [[01:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3633.4s)]
*  That's a great point. [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3634.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3635.4s)]
*  Humans do best when their choices are limited. [[01:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3636.4s)]
*  I think that's great to hear actually. [[01:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3637.4s)]
*  And if you have every new technology that comes out the Amish ask themselves what is this going to do to our community. [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3639.4s)]
*  And they usually come to a conclusion that they shouldn't accept this new technology. [[01:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3649.4s)]
*  Wow. [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3653.4s)]
*  And we should do a lot more of that on the individual level. [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3654.4s)]
*  But I realize how hard it is like I kept off from getting a smartphone for a bunch of years longer than most people. [[01:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3657.4s)]
*  But then I got one and I spent too much time on it. [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3664.4s)]
*  And we're we're so easily falling into those holes. [[01:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3668.4s)]
*  It's interesting. [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3674.4s)]
*  People need to spend time outside like people need to get away from light pollution and noise pollution and just get to a quiet place and sit there and think a little bit. [[01:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3675.4s)]
*  So many of our politicians and stuff who are making big decisions that affect everybody. [[01:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3685.4s)]
*  Most of them have never been to a wilderness area. [[01:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3691.4s)]
*  Like they don't even know what it is to be a human animal. [[01:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3695.4s)]
*  They just know like what it is to be living in modern society and think that that's how everything has to be. [[01:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3699.4s)]
*  You know. [[01:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3705.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3706.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3707.4s)]
*  And we it's so funny even here and like it's making me think like we think that so much like even as being in L.A. [[01:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3708.4s)]
*  for a while you start to think that everybody's similar you that everybody's like you. [[01:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3713.4s)]
*  Which probably makes you have some desire to be different which makes a lot of people act freakishly probably. [[01:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3717.4s)]
*  Yeah I don't know man. [[01:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3725.4s)]
*  Maybe not. [[01:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3727.4s)]
*  Maybe. [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3728.4s)]
*  I mean you might be right. [[01:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3729.4s)]
*  I couldn't I was listening to you but I couldn't process what you were saying. [[01:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3730.4s)]
*  And that's why my eyes you know sometimes just fucking you know sometimes I go offline man and that's it. [[01:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3732.4s)]
*  There's nothing I can do. [[01:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3739.4s)]
*  Sometimes I'm looking at stuff I don't really know what's going on. [[01:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3740.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3742.4s)]
*  You know. [[01:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3743.4s)]
*  But you can also like. [[01:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3744.4s)]
*  But you know here's what I was thinking. [[01:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3745.4s)]
*  But it's not our fault as humans. [[01:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3746.4s)]
*  It's like we're just humans like if you're just born into the into an environment like it's nobody's fault. [[01:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3747.4s)]
*  Right. [[01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3753.4s)]
*  Yeah exactly. [[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3754.4s)]
*  So it's just like I guess what type of and what type of life do we want to know or what type of. [[01:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3755.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3760.4s)]
*  What can like what type of life do we want to live. [[01:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3761.4s)]
*  What do we want to know. [[01:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3764.4s)]
*  You know what. [[01:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3765.4s)]
*  What do we want to see is like the capabilities in ourselves. [[01:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3766.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3770.4s)]
*  Some cultures especially are very happy with just like comfort and you know and then I think there's some people are not cultures but some people they just want more. [[01:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3771.4s)]
*  They want something different. [[01:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3779.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3780.4s)]
*  When things are available it's hard to deny yourself taking them. [[01:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3781.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3786.4s)]
*  And so yeah. [[01:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3787.4s)]
*  That's the British dude. [[01:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3788.4s)]
*  You know. [[01:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3790.4s)]
*  So we get blamed for slavery but they really did it. [[01:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3791.4s)]
*  But. [[01:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3793.4s)]
*  But yeah it's so true. [[01:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3795.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3796.4s)]
*  It's like when things and it's like I wonder if that's just the story of humans how we're supposed to be. [[01:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3797.4s)]
*  It's like probably. [[01:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3801.4s)]
*  I'm like a phallus. [[01:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3802.4s)]
*  You know it's just like it's natural. [[01:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3803.4s)]
*  Right. [[01:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3806.4s)]
*  What we're doing is natural. [[01:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3807.4s)]
*  And even a bird you set a nice little thing of bread over to you know two branches from a bird that guy's going to fucking be over there. [[01:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3808.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3814.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3815.4s)]
*  So once birds get these little you know. [[01:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3816.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3817.4s)]
*  They get a smart beak. [[01:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3818.4s)]
*  For fucking rap. [[01:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3820.4s)]
*  A coyote ate my fiancee's sandals the other day and I was kind of surprised. [[01:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3822.4s)]
*  Sexy kind of. [[01:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3829.4s)]
*  I was kind of surprised that a coyote had the spare time to be doing that kind of stuff. [[01:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3832.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3836.4s)]
*  Shouldn't they be out finding something to eat. [[01:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3837.4s)]
*  You know I'm telling you it's hitting everybody. [[01:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3839.4s)]
*  Yeah it is. [[01:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3840.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3841.4s)]
*  Creature comforts man. [[01:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3842.4s)]
*  You're going to see a coyote in sandals like a whole bunch around. [[01:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3843.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3848.4s)]
*  It's interesting. [[01:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3849.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3850.4s)]
*  So when do you go back when you go back into into the great white north. [[01:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3851.4s)]
*  You're so far up there. [[01:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3853.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3854.4s)]
*  You're so far up there. [[01:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3855.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3856.4s)]
*  You're close to Asia. [[01:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3857.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3858.4s)]
*  People don't even realize it when you get to the north of Alaska. [[01:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3859.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3861.4s)]
*  You're almost you're pretty much practically Japanese. [[01:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3862.4s)]
*  A little bit. [[01:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3864.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3865.4s)]
*  So we went into one of the Alaskan islands where you can see Russia it's like 35 miles [[01:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3866.4s)]
*  away and you just see this icy cliff and the native folks said that they used to go back [[01:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3870.4s)]
*  and forth because the Siberian Yup'iks speak the same language as the ones in the Alaska [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3875.4s)]
*  side. [[01:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3880.4s)]
*  They used to trade ladies back and forth and stuff and now they can't anymore. [[01:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3881.4s)]
*  And yeah so it's a crazy environment it's mostly treeless up up that far north. [[01:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3886.4s)]
*  It's north of the tree line so you can see really great distances and yeah it's incredible. [[01:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3893.4s)]
*  It comes alive in June all the little plants start growing a little bit and flowering the [[01:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3900.4s)]
*  birds are all breeding. [[01:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3905.4s)]
*  Bears are fattening up and then by late August it starts snowing again and everything dies [[01:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3906.4s)]
*  and then September it starts getting covered in snow again. [[01:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3911.4s)]
*  So you really it's really life cycle you see a real life cycle. [[01:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3915.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3918.4s)]
*  Very condensed into a short period of time. [[01:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3919.4s)]
*  Wow. [[01:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3921.4s)]
*  And yeah so I once the migratory birds take off then I basically follow them down to Costa [[01:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3922.4s)]
*  Rica and get there and see them passing through. [[01:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3929.4s)]
*  So it's kind of a migratory lifestyle. [[01:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3932.4s)]
*  You ever seen one of the same birds? [[01:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3935.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3937.4s)]
*  Well I haven't seen one up there and then seen the same individual down there but I have [[01:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3938.4s)]
*  seen birds return that have gone on migration and come back to the same exact places. [[01:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3944.4s)]
*  So because I've done bird research in Costa Rica and you band them you put little color [[01:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3950.4s)]
*  leg bands on them. [[01:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3955.4s)]
*  Oh yeah I've seen it on the internet they put a little sock or something. [[01:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3956.4s)]
*  Yeah and so yeah we had we studied golden wing warblers and they winter in Central America [[01:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3958.4s)]
*  and breed up in northern US and Canada. [[01:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3965.4s)]
*  So they fly all the way there navigating by the stars and then past the breeding season [[01:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3968.4s)]
*  don't get eaten by anything reproduce and fly all the way back to the same patches of [[01:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3974.4s)]
*  forest and it's a little nine gram bird. [[01:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3979.4s)]
*  Do you think it's just like like coming home it's just like humans do you think it's some [[01:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3982.4s)]
*  of that same type of thing like you want to go home sometimes or that or is it just more [[01:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3985.4s)]
*  of like a like a natural thing they just that like they they have to go right back to the [[01:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3990.4s)]
*  same spot like is there a reason for it? [[01:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3996.4s)]
*  They have territories so they'll come back to the same spot and defend the territory [[01:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=3998.4s)]
*  even on the wintering grounds. [[01:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=4004.4s)]
*  Some of them pretty aggressively but. [[01:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=4006.4s)]
*  And do they have gay birds too or not? [[01:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=4009.4s)]
*  Be honest with me. [[01:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=4011.4s)]
*  Yeah I mean ducks especially are. [[01:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=4012.4s)]
*  Oh yeah in the park all the time. [[01:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=4019.4s)]
*  Yeah and penguins are terrible. [[01:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=4021.4s)]
*  If I was a penguin I would be. [[01:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=4023.4s)]
*  You're out there dude it's a tough life dude. [[01:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=4025.4s)]
*  Yeah you show up to shore and there's two million of them. [[01:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=4028.4s)]
*  Dude you're playing a you know you're playing a rooter than anybody that's freaking you [[01:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=4032.4s)]
*  know willing at that point. [[01:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=4036.4s)]
*  Got a pulse or not. [[01:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=4038.4s)]
*  Yeah I worked in Antarctica as well so I've done. [[01:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=4040.4s)]
*  That's the North Pole really. [[01:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=4045.4s)]
*  The Antarctic. [[01:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=4047.4s)]
*  The South Pole? [[01:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=4048.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=4049.4s)]
*  Yeah I worked on a sail ship a hundred year old Dutch tall ship that took people down [[01:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=4050.4s)]
*  to the Antarctic Peninsula from Argentina and back. [[01:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=4056.4s)]
*  And once we did a trip all the way over to South Africa from South America via Antarctica [[01:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=4060.4s)]
*  visited Tristan de Cuno which is the most remote inhabited island in the whole world. [[01:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=4067.4s)]
*  Wow. [[01:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=4072.4s)]
*  It's like 400 inbred people living on this volcano in the middle of the Atlantic. [[01:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=4073.4s)]
*  400 people only six last names. [[01:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=4077.4s)]
*  Oh that's beautiful man. [[01:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=4080.4s)]
*  Yeah pretty cool. [[01:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=4081.4s)]
*  And what do they seem like at a certain point or they do they seem really like in tune with [[01:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=4082.4s)]
*  what's going on or they just like five armed and just you know hoping for the best. [[01:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=4086.4s)]
*  It's pretty weird they weren't even on a monetary system until 1960 so they were just bartering [[01:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=4090.4s)]
*  and stuff and every family has like a couple of sheep and a cow and a certain size piece [[01:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=4097.4s)]
*  of land on the side of this volcano. [[01:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=4101.4s)]
*  Wow. [[01:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=4104.4s)]
*  They were nice people but you could tell that after being there a couple days they're kind [[01:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=4105.4s)]
*  of ready for you to get out of there. [[01:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=4109.4s)]
*  Oh really. [[01:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=4111.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=4112.4s)]
*  Because you kind of what you upset the flow a little bit. [[01:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=4113.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=4114.4s)]
*  Just maybe just because like we're talking about you're supposed to know everybody in [[01:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=4115.4s)]
*  your immediate sphere and then you have this ship sailing up and a bunch of scruffy people [[01:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=4120.4s)]
*  from Holland and stuff coming up and taking pictures of everything. [[01:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=4127.4s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=4131.4s)]
*  It's probably a little off putting. [[01:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=4132.4s)]
*  Yeah I could imagine. [[01:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=4134.4s)]
*  I'd like to go over there and we could do a group trip you know do a work work trip. [[01:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=4135.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=4140.4s)]
*  You have to sail there or take a boat there like there's no other way to get there because [[01:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=4141.4s)]
*  it's too far for any. [[01:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=4146.4s)]
*  And when you pull up like what are these people doing I mean they're all but I mean like you [[01:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=4148.4s)]
*  said it's very tribal huh. [[01:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=4151.4s)]
*  It's not really tribal like they're. [[01:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=4153.4s)]
*  They're all one group. [[01:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=4156.4s)]
*  Yeah yeah but they're it's not native people that's the weird thing they're all descended [[01:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=4158.4s)]
*  from sealers and whalers who shipwrecked there. [[01:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=4162.4s)]
*  So there's Italian descent English descent they have this kind of weird British accent [[01:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=4165.4s)]
*  it's really weird and it's chicks or not. [[01:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=4170.4s)]
*  Be honest I didn't see anybody in my last question for you are this my last thing I [[01:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=4173.4s)]
*  want to think about that everybody you know it's obviously a big topic always global warming [[01:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=4181.4s)]
*  you know like do you what are your thoughts and do you feel like we are ruining things [[01:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=4185.4s)]
*  you feel like that this is the flow of things that you know that there's a cycle like what [[01:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=4191.4s)]
*  what's some of your vibe from being up there on some of the front lines of just seeing [[01:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=4198.4s)]
*  what's happening. [[01:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=4202.4s)]
*  Yeah where I work there's a lot of people studying climate change and yeah it's very [[01:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=4203.4s)]
*  clear that it's happening and of course it's because of us like at least to a certain extent [[01:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=4209.4s)]
*  like the amount of people on the earth burning things and using up resources like there's [[01:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=4215.4s)]
*  no way that that wouldn't affect things. [[01:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=4221.4s)]
*  So but to me that's kind of like it's a big concern but even if we fixed that we'd still [[01:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=4224.4s)]
*  not be really getting anywhere as far as I'm concerned. [[01:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=4232.4s)]
*  And do you see like a lot of the people that are up there doing research and that kind [[01:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=4237.4s)]
*  of stuff do you trust all the research that they're doing like sometimes it just seems [[01:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=4240.4s)]
*  like I mean people these days especially you can create any any any belief you want and [[01:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=4243.4s)]
*  I'm not denying climate or anything like that I'm saying like but you know people can [[01:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=4250.4s)]
*  create anything they want everybody has a technology to create any story that they want [[01:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=4254.4s)]
*  to. [[01:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=4258.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=4259.4s)]
*  Do you see some of that like some of it seems like kind of motivated like in like negative [[01:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=4260.4s)]
*  ways or do you feel like it's it's honest just research like people want to know what's [[01:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=4264.4s)]
*  going on. [[01:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=4267.4s)]
*  I think the research is pretty honest trying to document what's going on but you definitely [[01:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=4268.4s)]
*  see people studying things that they know they'll be able to get funding for. [[01:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=4273.4s)]
*  So that right. [[01:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=4278.4s)]
*  So you have to say yeah you almost have to you have to plan ahead because you want to [[01:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=4279.4s)]
*  get the funding. [[01:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=4282.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=4283.4s)]
*  Because you know yeah even if your idea is to opt to sometimes though it could be more [[01:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=4284.4s)]
*  helpful. [[01:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=4287.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=4288.4s)]
*  A government agency or something I can do the funding for that exactly. [[01:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=4289.4s)]
*  It's going to sound crazy to them. [[01:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=4291.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=4292.4s)]
*  Wow. [[01:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=4293.4s)]
*  But it's a yeah it's a great place and there's up to 150 people there during the peak of [[01:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=4294.4s)]
*  the summer. [[01:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=4299.4s)]
*  There's only about three people there during the winter most of the time just three people [[01:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=4300.4s)]
*  losing it. [[01:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=4306.4s)]
*  And a little bit of murder every now and then or what? [[01:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=4307.4s)]
*  No there's never been any real that's the thing is like I don't know we look back at [[01:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=4310.4s)]
*  hunter gatherer people are small groups of people and think that it was all violence [[01:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=4315.4s)]
*  all the time. [[01:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=4319.4s)]
*  Really wasn't like it was occasional skirmishes with neighboring groups and stuff but like [[01:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=4320.4s)]
*  it wasn't that bad. [[01:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=4325.4s)]
*  It was high infant mortality but if you made it through that you generally lived a pretty [[01:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=4327.4s)]
*  normal lifespan. [[01:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=4332.4s)]
*  Yeah babies die especially if you got an open fire going on. [[01:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=4334.4s)]
*  I know yeah. [[01:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=4337.4s)]
*  Babies are risky you know. [[01:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=4338.4s)]
*  And they would let them crawl into it. [[01:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=4339.4s)]
*  It's crazy just to see what the gods wanted. [[01:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=4341.4s)]
*  Yeah or just to let the strong survive. [[01:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=4343.4s)]
*  That's crazy. [[01:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=4345.4s)]
*  It's just different. [[01:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=4346.4s)]
*  It's like one of those Tony Robbins things. [[01:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=4347.4s)]
*  It's just different value systems you know that we can't imagine taking part in but [[01:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=4349.4s)]
*  if we were born there we'd think it's totally normal. [[01:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=4355.4s)]
*  Right. [[01:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=4357.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=4358.4s)]
*  You know what's sad almost almost almost feel like a little bit not embarrassed I guess [[01:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=4359.4s)]
*  talking to you a little bit but like almost feel a little ashamed of our own existence [[01:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=4362.4s)]
*  a little bit. [[01:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=4366.4s)]
*  Not from you as a person but just like thinking about that because you never think about it. [[01:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=4367.4s)]
*  You know like you never really I don't know or I don't anyway. [[01:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=4373.4s)]
*  A lot of people might and I wish I did more. [[01:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=4378.4s)]
*  And I think you actually reached out to me originally saying hey man you should go on [[01:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=4380.4s)]
*  some hikes. [[01:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=4383.4s)]
*  You should. [[01:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=4384.4s)]
*  I think that's how we kind of crossed paths. [[01:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=4385.4s)]
*  Is that right. [[01:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=4387.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=4388.4s)]
*  I called in with this one call. [[01:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=4389.4s)]
*  Oh that's right. [[01:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=4392.4s)]
*  OK. [[01:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=4393.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=4394.4s)]
*  Because then I know we've communicated every million you sent me some very beautiful pictures [[01:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=4395.4s)]
*  and we're going to put some of those up throughout the episode and like just kind of filling me [[01:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=4397.4s)]
*  in like every now and then I'll get you know like an email just letting me know what's [[01:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=4402.4s)]
*  going on. [[01:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=4407.4s)]
*  Faultful of a guanameat. [[01:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=4408.4s)]
*  With some crazy birds. [[01:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=4409.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=4410.4s)]
*  I'm like OK. [[01:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=4411.4s)]
*  And I'll tell somebody next to me and they don't give a fuck. [[01:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=4412.4s)]
*  Right. [[01:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=4414.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=4415.4s)]
*  They do not care. [[01:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=4416.4s)]
*  But yeah. [[01:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=4417.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=4418.4s)]
*  You shouldn't feel embarrassed or anything like I know I feel ashamed a little bit as [[01:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=4419.4s)]
*  a human. [[01:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=4423.4s)]
*  There's a little bit of that that starts up. [[01:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=4424.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=4425.4s)]
*  Well that's good. [[01:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=4426.4s)]
*  I think we should all have a little bit of that because we at the expense or what we [[01:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=4427.4s)]
*  demand for our standard of living creates a lot of destruction. [[01:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=4432.4s)]
*  So we should be ashamed of it. [[01:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=4437.4s)]
*  We should be aware. [[01:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=4439.4s)]
*  We should do some work to become aware of our effects on the world because just to be [[01:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=4440.4s)]
*  a good neighbor to other things you know. [[01:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=4446.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=4448.4s)]
*  That would be nice. [[01:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=4449.4s)]
*  But I know it sounds preachy and I know that most people are just getting up and having [[01:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=4450.4s)]
*  to work and not don't have the time to think about that stuff. [[01:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=4455.4s)]
*  But it sounds hopeful though also I think in a little bit. [[01:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=4458.4s)]
*  I think I don't think it sounds preachy. [[01:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=4461.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=4462.4s)]
*  I don't think you sound preachy at all. [[01:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=4463.4s)]
*  I think it sounds like studied and hopeful you know. [[01:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=4464.4s)]
*  I'm not hopeful. [[01:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=4470.4s)]
*  Right. [[01:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=4471.4s)]
*  At all. [[01:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=4472.4s)]
*  Maybe I want you to be. [[01:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=4473.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=4474.4s)]
*  Damn bro. [[01:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=4475.4s)]
*  Just when you fly into LAX man like. [[01:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=4476.4s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[01:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=4478.4s)]
*  Look. [[01:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=4479.4s)]
*  I'm not asking you to have hope around here. [[01:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=4480.4s)]
*  Okay. [[01:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=4481.4s)]
*  But no I look it's like especially here like you know everybody look at people here look [[01:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=4482.4s)]
*  down they have no empathy for like people in other parts of like especially America smaller [[01:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=4486.4s)]
*  towns where people are like what do they do? [[01:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=4490.4s)]
*  They're all they're doing is like having a lot of trying to have a good life. [[01:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=4492.4s)]
*  Right. [[01:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=4495.4s)]
*  Be loving more to their neighbor. [[01:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=4496.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=4497.4s)]
*  And not get overwhelmed with things that don't kind of make their spirit feel good. [[01:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=4498.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=4502.4s)]
*  They're more into you have more people that can hunt more people that can grow. [[01:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=4503.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=4506.4s)]
*  I agree man. [[01:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=4507.4s)]
*  I mean that kind of stuff makes me furious. [[01:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=4508.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=4510.4s)]
*  It's hard when there's some parts of rural living that aren't good you know like there's [[01:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=4511.4s)]
*  the massive opioid addiction issues but I think that stems from them being dismissed [[01:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=4516.4s)]
*  by everybody else and. [[01:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=4523.4s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[01:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=4525.4s)]
*  Industries like coal coming in and taking all the money away and leaving people sick and [[01:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=4526.4s)]
*  stuff. [[01:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=4530.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=4531.4s)]
*  It's not surprising at all. [[01:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=4532.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=4533.4s)]
*  It's not surprising at all when people feel like left out. [[01:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=4534.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=4536.4s)]
*  And it's happening in the village in Costa Rica too where everybody's being raised to [[01:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=4537.4s)]
*  think if you get out of this village you're a success if you get a college degree it doesn't [[01:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=4542.4s)]
*  matter what you end up doing or if you never see your family again that's a success and [[01:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=4547.4s)]
*  we kind of did that in this country too. [[01:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=4552.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=4554.4s)]
*  And people are separated from their families and it's happening down there and it's kind [[01:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=4555.4s)]
*  of like. [[01:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=4561.4s)]
*  I think some of that could change though. [[01:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=4562.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=4564.4s)]
*  I think some of that could really start to change. [[01:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=4565.4s)]
*  I hope so. [[01:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=4566.4s)]
*  I believe that because I think people are starting to realize that there's just such a there's [[01:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=4567.4s)]
*  such a with not certain parts of America like LA used to control like what would happen [[01:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=4571.4s)]
*  in Hollywood and in the media and that sort of thing and it's going away now so I think [[01:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=4577.4s)]
*  a lot of people who are dreamers or who want to be creators I think they I think a lot [[01:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=4581.4s)]
*  of people are hopefully going to start to want to build up the places that they're from [[01:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=4586.4s)]
*  the places that they live because there's such a bottleneck here. [[01:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=4590.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=4593.4s)]
*  Such a bottleneck in certain places that a lot of the best creativity never gets to be [[01:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=4594.4s)]
*  seen. [[01:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=4597.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=4598.4s)]
*  Even though if it were spread out a little bit more it would really flourish. [[01:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=4599.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=4602.4s)]
*  Did you have any people believing really wild things where you grew up like rural superstitions [[01:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=4603.4s)]
*  or. [[01:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=4610.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=4611.4s)]
*  We have a woman we're friends with down in the village who. [[01:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=4612.4s)]
*  We're down in Costa Rica. [[01:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=4615.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=4616.4s)]
*  40 years ago when she was pregnant they had an outhouse out in the backyard and she had [[01:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=4617.4s)]
*  to go to the bathroom at night and she didn't feel like. [[01:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=4622.4s)]
*  When they're not. [[01:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=4626.4s)]
*  She. [[01:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=4627.4s)]
*  She didn't feel like walking all the way to the outhouse so she just went behind the house. [[01:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=4628.4s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[01:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=4631.4s)]

*  That's men. [[01:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=4634.4s)]
*  When she looked down after she peed there was a fur deliance pit viper coiled up right [[01:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=4635.4s)]
*  there and she said it didn't bite me and she always prefaces this kind of stuff with I [[01:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=4640.4s)]
*  know you're not going to believe me but it didn't bite me because the urine of pregnant [[01:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=4646.4s)]

*  No. [[01:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=4655.4s)]
*  Electrocuted. [[01:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=4656.4s)]
*  I could see that. [[01:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=4657.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=4658.4s)]

*  Yeah. [[01:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=4660.4s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[01:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=4661.4s)]
*  Dude if something pissed on me that was pregnant I'd take the afternoon off. [[01:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=4662.4s)]
*  Easily man. [[01:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=4665.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=4666.4s)]

*  I mean I'll just take the afternoon off man. [[01:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=4669.4s)]
*  I mean that's really as dark arts as you can get. [[01:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=4672.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=4674.4s)]
*  Dude you have to come back and let us know what's going on out there you know. [[01:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=4675.4s)]
*  Any warning signs you know of like any real huge flare ups. [[01:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=4678.4s)]
*  But I certainly appreciate you coming Seth and just talking to us about you know what [[01:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=4682.4s)]
*  it's like up by the North Pole up by Alaska and like and they never built a Santa or anything [[01:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=4686.4s)]
*  like that up there right? [[01:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=4691.4s)]
*  Yeah actually south of Fairbanks is a town called North Pole where they have a giant [[01:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=4692.4s)]
*  Santa statue and a sad little reindeer in a pen and you can go sit on Santa's lap and [[01:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=4698.4s)]
*  stuff it's a little dark artish. [[01:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=4703.4s)]
*  Yeah and they're also seem like they're trying to make a statement with the reindeer in the [[01:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=4705.4s)]
*  pen are they or no? [[01:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=4708.4s)]
*  Or is it just it's a real reindeer? [[01:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=4709.4s)]
*  It's real but it's not a real good one. [[01:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=4711.4s)]
*  It's looking pretty sad. [[01:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=4714.4s)]
*  Wow look dude there's so little like 30 reindeer left. [[01:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=4715.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=4719.4s)]
*  But that's you know when you see animals in the zoo and they're walking in circles and [[01:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=4720.4s)]
*  stuff I kind of draw a parallel between that and human society like they have food they [[01:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=4725.4s)]
*  have shelter so in a sense you think they're fine. [[01:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=4732.4s)]
*  Right. [[01:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=4736.4s)]
*  But why are they walking in circles like same with us like we're safe generally we've got [[01:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=4737.4s)]
*  food don't have to worry about all that much why are people so unhappy? [[01:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=4741.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=4746.4s)]
*  Because there's something that tiger who walks around the cage all day long is missing. [[01:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=4747.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=4752.4s)]

*  It's a good thought man. [[01:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=4756.4s)]
*  We got to break out of the zoo. [[01:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=4757.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=4759.4s)]
*  But we also have to yeah we have to break out of the zoo we just have to do it we got to [[01:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r9_re7H2Qc&t=4760.4s)]
