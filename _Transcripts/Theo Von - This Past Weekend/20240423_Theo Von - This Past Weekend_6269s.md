*  I have some tour dates I would like to announce for Europe. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm going to a friend's wedding in Europe and so I was able to find some dates last minute. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=3.34s)]
*  And these are what we can do for now. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=10.0s)]
*  I will be coming back and doing other cities and maybe doing some of these cities again. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=13.8s)]
*  So don't be upset if I'm not coming to where you are right now. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=19.5s)]
*  I'll be in Belfast on June 7 at the SSE Arena. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=25.900000000000002s)]

*  Manchester UK on June 13 and London UK on June 15. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=36.4s)]
*  Those tickets in Europe are all on sale right now. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=45.1s)]
*  I will also be in Las Vegas on July 5th and 6th at Resorts World. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=48.2s)]

*  We also have tickets remaining for Halifax, Nova Scotia and Vancouver in the British Columbia. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=66.0s)]
*  Today's guest is truly one of a kind. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=73.5s)]
*  He is everywhere right now. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=76.4s)]

*  I'm fortunate to get to spend time with what is also quite possibly one of the greatest minds in football right now. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=90.6s)]
*  If we're being honest, today's guest is Sketch. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=97.2s)]

*  Yeah, that's scary. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=137.5s)]
*  I wouldn't want to do that. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=138.5s)]
*  When she was pumping me up, she's like putting the pressure on the bag and stuff. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=140.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=143.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's when it was like, I'm going to still kind of feel the pressure. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=143.5s)]
*  It feels it's whack. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=146.8s)]

*  I had no clue it was coming. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=824.7800000000001s)]
*  Dang bro. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=826.6600000000001s)]
*  So, yeah, because you got to buy land from a dude in a truck. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=827.6600000000001s)]
*  If a dude rolls up in a Camry or whatever, I ain't buying your fucking land, bro. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=832.1s)]
*  That's like selling crypto there. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=837.1400000000001s)]
*  It's a scam there. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=838.38s)]
*  Yeah, that's bad. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=840.34s)]
*  Here we go. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=841.34s)]
*  Bro, if some dude rolls up in a Fiat or a Mini Cooper, I ain't buying your land, bro. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=842.34s)]
*  No way. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=848.26s)]
*  If he's got a squat to get in his car, no way. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=849.26s)]
*  Unless he's a bitch or something. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=852.7s)]
*  Dude, I used to have a little person that was a… [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=854.6600000000001s)]
*  Some people say midget. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=858.34s)]
*  I think midget is actually French, I think. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=859.34s)]
*  It's French for keychain. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=862.0600000000001s)]
*  Is it? [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=863.3000000000001s)]

*  Put them in your pocket. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=866.3000000000001s)]
*  Well, it would be great if you had a little person just hold your keys all the time. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=867.3000000000001s)]
*  That's a good business plan. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=871.3000000000001s)]
*  You got to go to Ireland for them, I hear. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=872.94s)]
*  That would be great. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=874.86s)]
*  Or if he wore them on his earrings. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=875.86s)]
*  Oh, yeah, like a minion. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=877.46s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=878.86s)]
*  Like, this pick will be minions. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=879.86s)]
*  And then you just brought him up to the door and he was just ear height of most door locks. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=881.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=886.54s)]
*  Oh, that would be great. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=887.54s)]
*  Well, the good thing is they'd probably have it harder to get robbed from him. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=888.54s)]
*  So it's probably a good thing for a manager. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=893.14s)]
*  Well, we had a little person at night. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=894.78s)]
*  He was our roommate and we would watch him. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=896.54s)]
*  We would all get together and have a beer or whatever and watch him run and jump into [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=898.1999999999999s)]

*  Oh, my gosh. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=903.66s)]
*  That's an Olympic sport there. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=904.66s)]
*  Slingshot him. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=907.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=908.18s)]
*  It was pretty crazy. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=909.18s)]
*  No, he never wanted any help. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=910.18s)]
*  He was very much like a, you know, he was kind of like a Jackie Robinson of little people. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=911.3s)]
*  That's awesome. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=918.3399999999999s)]
*  Like an independent woman. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=919.9799999999999s)]
*  Yeah, he wanted to do it. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=920.9799999999999s)]
*  Yeah, like a very Shania Twain type of guy. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=921.9799999999999s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=924.66s)]
*  Yeah, he was like the littlest dixie chick. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=925.66s)]
*  He wanted to do it his own way. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=928.9s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=930.3399999999999s)]

*  Is that true? [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=936.8599999999999s)]
*  I think so. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=937.8599999999999s)]
*  They're little people, little brains might go together, but I've met some. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=939.1800000000001s)]
*  They're pretty smart. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=944.82s)]
*  They all are smart. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=945.82s)]
*  Yeah, I'm trying to think if you have less. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=946.82s)]
*  I think they must be just the same amount of smart because my friend Brad is a little [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=949.98s)]
*  person and he seems very smart. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=953.82s)]
*  Let me see. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=957.3000000000001s)]
*  Almost all people with dysproportions, dwarfism have normal intellectual capacities. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=959.3000000000001s)]
*  Rare exceptions are usually the result of a secondary factor such as excess fluid around [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=964.02s)]
*  the brain, which is the opposite of what you have. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=968.3s)]
*  Yeah, a lot of extra space. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=971.0999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, so they're really, I guess if they got too much water on them. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=974.02s)]
*  Well, it's water weight. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=979.14s)]
*  It's always the water weight that gets to you. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=980.9s)]
*  Maybe they need an IV. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=983.14s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=984.14s)]
*  Well, you get them, maybe that's how they get bigger. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=985.14s)]
*  Oh, an IV would be a lot. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=987.9399999999999s)]
*  Kind of like those things you put in the water and then they grow and get bigger like that? [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=989.5s)]
*  Like those little, what are the things, like a little dragon or something? [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=993.4599999999999s)]
*  Like a little sponge? [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=997.62s)]
*  Yeah, put them in the water and get bigger. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=998.62s)]
*  I like that. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=1000.98s)]
*  They had a movie called Gremlins and that's what they did on there. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=1001.98s)]
*  It was like these kind of bad animals and they've just been misbehaving, I guess, in [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=1007.7800000000001s)]
*  the community. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=1011.62s)]
*  And then they put water on them and they turned just really bad. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=1012.62s)]
*  Is this Yoda? [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=1016.98s)]
*  Yeah, this is like a, it's almost like a dirty little Yoda. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=1018.7800000000001s)]
*  It's like Yoda's little son that got busted probably selling Trank or whatever, doing [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=1022.9s)]
*  some low-key bad shit. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=1028.1799999999998s)]

*  But yeah, but that was a movie when they added water on them, it went bad. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=1041.26s)]
*  Maybe they live longer, like Yoda. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=1044.7s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=1046.8999999999999s)]

*  It's hard to know what I'm talking about. [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=1372.18s)]
*  But so what does your mom do for work? [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=1374.18s)]
*  My mom, she works with my dad and my dad does home building. [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=1377.18s)]
*  Oh really? [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=1380.18s)]
*  Yeah, so I would buy the land for them. [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=1381.18s)]
*  And then like we would approve it through like a committee or whatever. [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=1383.18s)]
*  And then that's how I would transact. [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=1387.18s)]
*  Oh, I see. So you, it was a family business. [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=1389.18s)]
*  Yes, sir. And then when like, so when I stopped, it slowed down in 2023 from interest rates. [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=1392.18s)]
*  And that's when I was like, oh, fuck it. I'll just start streaming. [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=1397.18s)]
*  And would not like to make money more. Just like, I have a free time. [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=1400.18s)]
*  I had a pretty easy schedule with them. [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=1404.18s)]
*  I didn't make a lot of money, but it was like, it was chill. [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=1406.18s)]
*  It was like enough to where it's like, just go in. [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=1409.18s)]
*  I mean, you're not buying land or you are. [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=1412.18s)]
*  So it's like, work from home. [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=1414.18s)]
*  I might have got some free dollars from my dad on that one. [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=1417.18s)]
*  I'll tell you what, you probably shouldn't let anyone work from home. [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=1421.18s)]
*  Pops is like, robbing them blind. Check your pockets. [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=1425.18s)]
*  That's a horrible idea to let somebody work from home, dude. [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=1430.18s)]
*  That's a, if it's your own family member too, because they're just working from home. [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=1435.18s)]
*  They're not doing nothing. [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=1439.18s)]
*  Oh yeah. And my boss wasn't a part of the family. [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=1440.18s)]
*  So it's like, who's going to, who's going to call me in? [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=1443.18s)]
*  I was like, I feel like I should tell someone, but I'm loving life right now. [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=1447.18s)]
*  It's a good thing that I found a new job. [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=1452.18s)]
*  You're like, I feel like it's 11 a.m. I'm going to take a nap early. [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=1455.18s)]
*  Oh yeah. But that's probably what time was. Waking up. [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=1458.18s)]
*  Wow. [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=1461.18s)]
*  Wake up, pop on stream, sending out. [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=1462.18s)]
*  I probably got two emails a day when I was working. [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=1465.18s)]
*  Oh, so very easy. [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=1467.18s)]
*  It was very easy. [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=1468.18s)]
*  It was calm waters for you guys, huh? [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=1470.18s)]
*  It was, yeah, I was just floating, floating down the river. [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=1472.18s)]
*  And what were some of the emails you would get? [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=1475.18s)]
*  Like, would it be people complaining like, hey, there's not enough land here or there's quick sand out here, whitey or something like that? [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=1477.18s)]
*  I had made some bad purchases before. I bought some stuff without looking at it. [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=1484.18s)]
*  That's not, and then they go, oh, there's an easement on it. [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=1488.18s)]
*  I was like, oh, shit. [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=1491.18s)]
*  It's like, you didn't see that either? [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=1492.18s)]
*  I've had some good ones and some bad ones. [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=1495.18s)]
*  Some ugly babies. [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=1498.18s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=1499.18s)]
*  You know, it's not. [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=1500.18s)]
*  Hey, there's still babies. [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=1501.18s)]
*  That's exactly. Exactly. [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=1502.18s)]
*  It's land regardless. [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=1504.18s)]
*  Hey, and once you're, yeah, you still got to breastfeed them, brother. [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=1505.18s)]
*  Yeah. Look at that. Lactose intolerant. [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=1508.18s)]
*  But I'll take one for the team. [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=1511.18s)]
*  So what kind of land was it? What was the land you would go, so what would you do with the land? [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=1514.18s)]
*  So it was like raw land and we were just like putting, we would spec houses on it. [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=1519.18s)]
*  So like when I was doing it in 2020, like your interest rates dropped. [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=1524.18s)]
*  The man was up because he had a housing boom and builders were like looking to replace empty inventory. [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=1529.18s)]
*  And it was, I was overbidding on a lot of the shit, like I mean from a thousand, like up to ten and fifteen thousand. [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=1535.18s)]
*  Like that was the only way to get shit on our contract. [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=1544.18s)]

*  They're not talking to the guy. [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=1859.58s)]

*  Yeah, I would like to have one. [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=2058.1s)]
*  I would like to have two. [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=2059.1s)]
*  I don't know if I have one mega one or if there's just a blank spot in the middle of [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=2060.1s)]
*  my gut or they're back here. [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=2061.3s)]
*  Yeah, I don't know. [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=2064.78s)]
*  Does it feel any different than the other side or whatever? [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=2066.9s)]
*  Sometimes if I don't drink water, it hurts to pee, but I don't know if that's my kidney [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=2070.1s)]
*  or my wiener. [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=2073.34s)]
*  You've got to get some, but we've got to get you some water, man. [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=2074.34s)]
*  Somebody's got to. [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=2080.54s)]
*  I've been drinking all day. [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=2081.54s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=2082.54s)]
*  I've been working on it. [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=2083.54s)]
*  Trying to fix these things. [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=2085.1s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=2086.1s)]
*  Get some oil in the car. [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=2087.1s)]
*  It's like driving a car without oil. [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=2088.1s)]
*  My fucking brain's got black smoke in it right now. [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=2090.22s)]
*  Man, I'm about to freaking pass out. [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=2093.58s)]
*  Oh my gosh, bro. [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=2096.7s)]
*  We're going to need to have AAA pull up in here, dude. [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=2099.18s)]
*  Bro, you got to, yeah, we got to get some water in you. [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=2102.46s)]
*  What did you play? [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=2106.74s)]
*  But I saw you playing athletics and I saw you playing football online. [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=2107.74s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=2112.18s)]
*  So you played football. [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=2113.18s)]
*  I went to a private school for a year and I played there. [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=2114.8199999999997s)]
*  Oh, so it's all whites, huh? [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=2117.02s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=2118.46s)]
*  It was definitely, it was like a lot of playing. [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=2119.46s)]
*  The wide receivers were dual sport athletes and soccer, so it was pretty easy. [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=2121.7s)]
*  120 pound wide receivers, throwing them around. [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=2127.3399999999997s)]
*  I was pretty thick back then. [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=2132.8999999999996s)]
*  I was like 205 when I was in ... [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=2134.2599999999998s)]
*  Really? [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=2136.62s)]
*  So you were lifting a lot of weights. [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=2137.62s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=2138.62s)]
*  I have a thing where if, especially during school, if they ever gave me, when I was younger, [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=2140.06s)]
*  I would go and if they put their card on the lunch line, we'd have Chick-fil-A and stuff [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=2146.8199999999997s)]
*  in there. [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=2152.58s)]
*  So I'd get two or three Chick-fil-A sandwiches. [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=2153.58s)]
*  They cut me off. [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=2155.38s)]
*  And then fast forward, went to private school, part of it is the meal plan or whatever. [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=2156.38s)]
*  I took advantage of it like no other. [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=2163.02s)]
*  Why they have a lot more unlimited meal kind of style? [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=2165.7799999999997s)]
*  Yeah, well, I wouldn't pack my lunch really. [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=2170.46s)]
*  So if I could, I would just show up kind of hungry and then fucking kind of meal around [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=2173.18s)]
*  like a raccoon between my friends. [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=2179.7s)]
*  When I was in middle school, there was this one kid named Bryce, but he was a nice guy. [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=2182.86s)]
*  But if you asked him nicely enough, he'd buy you a chicken sandwich every day. [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=2187.82s)]
*  Really? [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=2191.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=2192.7s)]
*  Every day? [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=2193.7s)]
*  Every day. [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=2194.7s)]
*  Bryce C. If he ever sees this, thank you, Bryce C. We'll drop his last name. [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=2195.8599999999997s)]
*  Yeah, Bryce, thank you. [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=2200.7799999999997s)]
*  I owe you Chick-fil-A, brother. [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=2203.14s)]
*  For a long time, it sounds like. [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=2205.8999999999996s)]
*  Oh yeah, I was getting... [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=2208.22s)]
*  How many meals did you pull off that fella? [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=2209.62s)]
*  Probably three sandwiches a week at least. [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=2213.74s)]
*  30 weeks and it was probably over the course of five years or four years. [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=2216.2999999999997s)]
*  Honey, that's 450 sandwiches, man. [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=2220.2999999999997s)]
*  I feel bad now. [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=2224.38s)]
*  I probably owned some chicken minis or something. [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=2225.38s)]
*  I own my whole chicken, a whole farm here. [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=2228.94s)]
*  I know, definitely. [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=2231.1400000000003s)]
*  Now I heard that Chick-fil-A is kind of fucked up, so I can't get him back the right way. [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=2232.1400000000003s)]
*  Sorry for cussing, but... [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=2237.26s)]
*  No, there's a lot of people. [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=2239.1400000000003s)]
*  What happened to the chicken and Chick-fil-A? [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=2240.98s)]
*  Let's bring that up. [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=2242.34s)]
*  And yeah, we'll have to do something nice for Bryce, man. [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=2243.34s)]
*  Maybe we'll see if we can't get something sent over to him. [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=2245.46s)]
*  You have his address or anything? [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=2248.1400000000003s)]
*  Oh, I have no clue. [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=2249.1400000000003s)]
*  I know he's a triplet. [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=2250.2200000000003s)]
*  We hit one of the three... [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=2253.82s)]
*  It's more of his pops that I own. [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=2255.5s)]
*  He's a great guy, but I owe his pops. [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=2257.86s)]
*  Well, this is the kind of shit I don't know. [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=2259.98s)]
*  His pops wean or stutter, okay? [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=2262.5800000000004s)]
*  I mean, three of the same thing. [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=2264.46s)]
*  One of these, it just dangles a little bit? [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=2266.5s)]
*  Well, it just... [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=2269.1000000000004s)]
*  Anybody who's making three of the same kid, bro, we get it. [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=2270.1000000000004s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=2273.54s)]
*  Quiet down. [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=2274.54s)]
*  Three-headed dragon? [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=2275.54s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=2276.54s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=2277.54s)]
*  I don't believe in twins and triplets, right? [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=2278.54s)]
*  If people were twins, it would make them fight until one of them won. [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=2281.3s)]
*  And that was the one that everybody talked to. [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=2286.02s)]
*  What does it say? [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=2289.94s)]
*  Siding diminishing chickens by Chick-fil-A will back off its pledge never to serve chicken [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=2290.94s)]
*  that was fed antibiotics. [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=2295.44s)]
*  Wow. [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=2297.54s)]
*  So instead, it will embrace a looser industry standard. [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=2298.54s)]
*  No antibiotics important to human medicine. [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=2301.7400000000002s)]
*  So I guess it can't have a chicken that's on, I guess, a Z-pack or whatever. [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=2305.66s)]
*  Some of those chickens are probably on Xanax now. [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=2310.34s)]
*  It's 2020, 2024 now. [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=2312.46s)]
*  Well, especially some of the flooding in that area. [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=2314.1000000000004s)]
*  I remember when it flooded in our area and my buddy's mom got on pills after that and [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=2316.58s)]
*  quit working. [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=2322.1800000000003s)]
*  So yeah, I'm sure a lot of this chicken is... [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=2323.7400000000002s)]
*  Something to do with the pills. [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=2328.06s)]
*  They're probably on Adderall now. [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=2329.42s)]
*  That's probably why they're so skinny. [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=2330.7400000000002s)]
*  They're all out there. [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=2333.06s)]
*  Everyone thinks chickens are stupid. [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=2334.06s)]
*  They're just wired to shit. [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=2335.6200000000003s)]
*  They're on 50 milligrams of... [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=2337.82s)]
*  Hope that get good stuff there. [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=2339.82s)]
*  Oh, they'll make an egg in eight minutes now. [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=2342.02s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=2344.1400000000003s)]
*  They'll cook it for you too. [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=2345.1400000000003s)]
*  That's where I can start. [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=2346.1400000000003s)]
*  I can put it on the grill for you. [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=2347.1400000000003s)]
*  How do you want it? [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=2349.46s)]
*  How do you want it, brother? [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=2350.46s)]
*  You start flipping that thing. [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=2351.46s)]
*  Oh, they're serving it a lot. [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=2353.54s)]
*  Yeah, I think that's true. [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=2355.06s)]
*  If a chicken's on Adderall, it could serve that egg anyway they want. [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=2356.06s)]
*  Why don't we cut out the middleman of the chef and get a chicken to serve the egg ready [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=2359.42s)]
*  to order? [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=2367.38s)]
*  I like that idea. [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=2368.38s)]
*  It's more probably humane there. [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=2370.38s)]
*  I don't care actually. [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=2371.9s)]
*  I eat rags regardless. [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=2372.9s)]
*  I eat a lot of meat. [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=2375.38s)]
*  Do you? [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=2376.38s)]
*  Well, this would save you time. [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=2377.38s)]
*  I mean, I think imagine a chicken can do that. [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=2378.38s)]
*  Boil or scramble would be crazy, I guess. [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=2384.3s)]
*  They've got to be able to know how to boil water there. [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=2388.2200000000003s)]
*  They've been on earth for as long as we have, so it's pretty- [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=2391.1s)]
*  If we could heat their bodies up enough in a safe environment where they don't pass away, [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=2394.1s)]
*  but they're able to serve. [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=2400.86s)]
*  I like that idea. [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=2403.14s)]
*  We buy like a YMCA with a sauna already in there. [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=2404.14s)]
*  Put them in the sauna, let them work out, let them use the equipment. [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=2407.66s)]
*  Maybe give them some library books. [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=2410.38s)]
*  I think if we had like Ted Talks going 24-7, they'd probably start gaining some information [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=2412.94s)]
*  Oh, I think there's no way they're not going to pick things up. [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=2417.94s)]
*  Oh, they probably pick stuff up without us knowing. [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=2420.98s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=2423.98s)]
*  Little crazy little claws there. [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=2424.98s)]
*  Oh, I can only imagine if I were a little fucking chicken. [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=2427.2599999999998s)]
*  That's the thing about chicken. [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=2430.46s)]
*  They're just like- [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=2433.5s)]
*  That's how they- they're like that. [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=2434.5s)]
*  Then when they're on the Adderall, it's like, hmmmmmm. [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=2435.5s)]
*  When it turns into more like a Humminbird, hmmmm. [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=2438.5s)]
*  That's all it is. [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=2443.18s)]
*  They probably- that's a good business plan there. [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=2444.18s)]
*  We need to trademark that stuff before it's gone. [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=2447.46s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=2449.94s)]
*  I'm sure it'll be gone the second somebody hears this. [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=2450.94s)]
*  It's already gone. [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=2453.38s)]
*  That's the problem with today. [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=2454.38s)]
*  Yeah, it's going to be like the- I forget the name of it, but probably a war crime to [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=2455.38s)]
*  give chickens amphetamines. [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=2460.82s)]
*  Well it's just sad that Chick-fil-A is resorting to getting this bootleg chicken. [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=2463.82s)]
*  And a lot of the chicken has probably been through, you know, has complex trauma. [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=2468.5s)]
*  It's probably- who knows where it's from? [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=2472.78s)]
*  Probably it could be Memphis. [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=2474.62s)]
*  It could be East St. Louis. [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=2476.34s)]
*  Who knows where a lot of these animals are coming from now? [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=2478.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=2481.02s)]
*  From all over. [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=2482.02s)]
*  All over the world. [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=2483.02s)]
*  There's Chicago too. [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=2484.02s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=2485.5s)]
*  I mean just some of the- us choosing to have different chicken, that's going to change [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=2486.5s)]
*  everybody. [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=2490.86s)]
*  That's going to change marriages. [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=2491.86s)]
*  There are marriages out there that are based solely on the fact that twice a week they [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=2493.1000000000004s)]
*  eat Chick-fil-A together. [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=2499.6200000000003s)]
*  That's true. [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=2500.94s)]
*  Actually got proposed to in a Canes. [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=2502.54s)]
*  In a Canes box. [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=2505.78s)]
*  She did not like that idea. [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=2507.54s)]
*  In a Canes- in the side of a Cane? [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=2509.1s)]
*  Open it up. [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=2511.06s)]
*  It was on the Texas toast. [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=2512.06s)]
*  No way. [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=2513.26s)]
*  No- yes way. [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=2514.26s)]
*  It was the worst idea. [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=2516.34s)]
*  Forever combo? [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=2518.18s)]
*  It was a short marriage though. [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=2519.18s)]
*  She's very married now. [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=2520.94s)]
*  Lovely lady. [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=2521.94s)]
*  Is she? [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=2522.94s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=2523.94s)]
*  Yes sir. [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=2524.94s)]
*  Happy Ian, you know. [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=2525.94s)]
*  Well yeah, I mean I think- where were you? [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=2526.94s)]
*  Were you doing it at a Canes? [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=2529.14s)]
*  What is the best fast food or quick dining as they like to say, place to get married [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=2530.78s)]
*  at you think? [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=2539.0600000000004s)]
*  Is Chili's count? [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=2540.46s)]
*  Is Chili's fast? [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=2541.5400000000004s)]
*  No that's not fast enough. [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=2542.5400000000004s)]
*  That's high class dining past. [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=2543.5400000000004s)]
*  I mean it's good food. [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=2545.5400000000004s)]
*  If you can get liquor there it probably doesn't count. [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=2546.94s)]
*  Well no, Chili's is great. [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=2549.7000000000003s)]
*  I think it's just a lot. [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=2550.9s)]
*  Chili's is a place you can meet women easily I think. [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=2551.9s)]
*  So I think if it's a place you can probably easily meet women then it's not applicable [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=2556.1s)]
*  for this. [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=2561.22s)]
*  Chili's cutter reminds me of- this is my first time going on Broadway but it's like- I see [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=2562.22s)]
*  two groups of people. [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=2565.5s)]
*  It's either super young chicks or super old chicks. [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=2566.8199999999997s)]
*  It's like the young chicks are partying, the older people are like going to war museums [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=2569.86s)]
*  or something. [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=2574.46s)]
*  That's how Chick-fil-A is at the bar. [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=2575.46s)]
*  Or not the Chili's is at the bar. [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=2578.3399999999997s)]
*  It's a mixed bag out there. [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=2580.2999999999997s)]
*  Chili's is a great place to go and back to in your hometown and make love to someone [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=2581.7s)]
*  that you didn't get to talk to in high school. [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=2586.5s)]

*  food chains. [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=2614.2599999999998s)]

*  or whatever. [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=3035.1s)]
*  See the sun again? [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=3036.1s)]
*  Usually, the Tacoma way in those houses. [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=3037.1s)]
*  Yeah, just one last orbit around the neighborhood. [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=3040.1s)]
*  You got to go through two, it got to go through an airlock to get to Grandma. [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=3043.8199999999997s)]
*  It's usually not a good sign. [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=3047.18s)]
*  Yeah, one last run through the wind before the Lord brings them home. [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=3049.3399999999997s)]

*  Look at that. [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=3056.42s)]
*  The three-year-old man's birthday wish to ride in a Lamborghini comes true. [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=3058.1800000000003s)]

*  I would do that. [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=3062.58s)]
*  I'll have prunes and oranges and cottage cheese in there for them. [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=3063.58s)]
*  All that stuff. [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=3068.14s)]
*  And they can hang their head out the window too. [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=3069.14s)]
*  I think it makes them feel good too. [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=3070.42s)]
*  I think that would be wonderful, man. [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=3073.98s)]
*  But the only thing about a yellow Lamborghini is it's also a, I think it's kind of like [[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=3075.46s)]
*  a gay beacon or whatever. [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=3079.02s)]
*  So it's definitely going to attract a lot of gay men out there. [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=3083.66s)]
*  Take any eyeballs. [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=3088.74s)]

*  Look at this. [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=3093.38s)]
*  They're taking pictures of the car. [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=3094.38s)]
*  They probably got some hot friends. [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=3095.7s)]
*  There we go. [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=3097.18s)]
*  Everything works out there. [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=3099.42s)]
*  Good thing it's black too. [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=3100.42s)]
*  It's black? [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=3104.06s)]
*  Yeah, it's going to be. [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=3105.06s)]
*  Oh, I thought it was yellow. [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=3106.06s)]
*  So we took a picture with that one and then he's sending me one. [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=3107.06s)]
*  Oh, so the one you're getting is black. [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=3110.46s)]
*  All black, brother. [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=3112.02s)]
*  Because yellow is, look at there. [[00:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=3113.5s)]
*  You go right there and there's a young man already sitting on that one. [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=3114.5s)]
*  Shirtless. [[00:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=3117.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=3118.3s)]

*  I'm not saying that. [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=3122.22s)]
*  Probably got tape over his nipples. [[00:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=3123.22s)]
*  Probably. [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=3124.22s)]

*  dude, he said he told us he was an EMT or whatever. [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=3132.14s)]
*  And he had me and my buddies doing like CPR on each other, right? [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=3135.66s)]
*  Practicing. [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=3141.3s)]
*  There was a fire in our neighborhood and somebody got burned. [[00:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=3142.5800000000004s)]
*  And so somebody's like, we got to run over to Mr. Gary's house. [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=3145.1000000000004s)]
*  He's an EMT. [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=3148.2200000000003s)]
*  He can help. [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=3149.2200000000003s)]
*  And somebody's like, that dude's not an EMT, dude. [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=3150.2200000000003s)]

*  You got your full certified there. [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=3164.3s)]
*  These bitches aren't worth anything. [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=3165.9s)]
*  You gave him more than lips. [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=3166.9s)]
*  You gave him a little tongue in there, brother. [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=3167.9s)]
*  He's trying to breathe. [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=3169.38s)]
*  I didn't do anything. [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=3170.38s)]
*  This one kid, William, he was a fucking weirdo. [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=3172.42s)]
*  But yeah, we shouldn't have been over there, but it doesn't matter. [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=3174.6600000000003s)]
*  But he ended up having a vehicle like that, you know? [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=3177.82s)]
*  And this other guy named Big Roy would always play Navy with us at his house. [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=3180.6600000000003s)]

*  More ladies get to see you. [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=3260.3799999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=3261.66s)]

*  growing up, were you comfortable talking with ladies and stuff? [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=3266.98s)]
*  I was not very good. [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=3269.2599999999998s)]
*  I just always had a friend, group of friends or whatever. [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=3270.4199999999996s)]
*  And then probably had too high hopes with a lot of ladies. [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=3272.8199999999997s)]
*  So it was usually flying solo. [[00:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=3276.8599999999997s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=3279.18s)]

*  Yeah. [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=3296.32s)]

*  or something and sort of do that with other people. [[00:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=3301.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=3303.84s)]

*  So you went to those schools, were you really homesick? [[01:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=3732.7799999999997s)]
*  I was homesick and then I loved Texas State and then COVID happened and I was just like... [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=3736.42s)]
*  Oh, so then you're home. [[01:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=3740.74s)]
*  I just got my real estate license, started working with my dad and then was like, just [[01:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=3742.06s)]
*  didn't, I wasn't really good at school so I was like, no, I'm just gonna do this. [[01:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=3746.54s)]
*  And then I somehow got here. [[01:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=3751.02s)]
*  And what are your parents, are they still married? [[01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=3753.62s)]
*  Still married, still paying off the college bill. [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=3756.34s)]
*  I will probably have to, not have to, but hopefully one day I can give them a little [[01:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=3759.8599999999997s)]
*  cash back there. [[01:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=3764.66s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[01:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=3766.1s)]
*  I need to give them some pre-play. [[01:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=3767.1s)]
*  Oh, yeah, I think they deserve probably something. [[01:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=3768.1s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=3770.8599999999997s)]
*  Like a skateboard or something or? [[01:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=3771.8599999999997s)]
*  Yeah, something probably less dangerous for them but... [[01:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=3773.74s)]
*  Supreme one. [[01:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=3776.7s)]
*  Yeah, now we're talking. [[01:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=3777.7s)]
*  Put a sticker on it. [[01:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=3778.7s)]
*  Even a skateboard you just put on the wall in the room. [[01:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=3779.7s)]
*  A longboard. [[01:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=3781.62s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=3782.62s)]
*  That or maybe a line bike. [[01:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=3783.62s)]
*  Or a two-seater, one of those two-seater bikes. [[01:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=3785.1s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[01:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=3787.2599999999998s)]
*  My step-parents used to always go ride on that, man, and everybody in the neighborhood [[01:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=3788.3s)]
*  would call them to yell out queers at them and stuff and I was like, what are we doing? [[01:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=3792.1000000000004s)]
*  Oh my gosh. [[01:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=3795.86s)]
*  I'll tell you what, I would take a sidecar for sure. [[01:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=3796.86s)]
*  Those are actually really hard to drive. [[01:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=3800.9s)]
*  Yeah, and those are harder to be seen on, I feel like, than drive. [[01:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=3803.42s)]
*  Who cares if you can drive it or not? [[01:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=3808.46s)]
*  I just feel like being seen on that is unbelievable. [[01:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=3810.5800000000004s)]
*  That's like a bike helmet. [[01:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=3814.3s)]
*  Like if my dad ever wears a bike helmet, dude, I'm out. [[01:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=3815.3s)]
*  I wouldn't trust the driver on the front of that thing. [[01:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=3819.18s)]
*  You're sitting there and... [[01:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=3822.02s)]
*  Yeah, especially if it's your husband or something because spouses are always getting rid of [[01:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=3823.3799999999997s)]
*  their husbands. [[01:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=3826.3399999999997s)]
*  Look at these two guys right here. [[01:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=3827.3399999999997s)]
*  A couple of Vietnamese guys biking. [[01:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=3828.3399999999997s)]
*  So you've never really been in love yet then, huh? [[01:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=3831.14s)]
*  So you didn't start dating until after... [[01:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=3836.3799999999997s)]
*  Yesterday was probably my first real date. [[01:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=3839.8199999999997s)]
*  Nuh-uh. [[01:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=3841.8599999999997s)]
*  Yes, sir. [[01:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=3842.8599999999997s)]
*  No way. [[01:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=3843.8599999999997s)]
*  And he's helping me out here. [[01:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=3844.8599999999997s)]
*  Look at that. [[01:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=3846.66s)]
*  Let's go. [[01:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=3848.14s)]
*  Bro, your first date and where did you guys go? [[01:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=3849.14s)]
*  We went to Eddie V's. [[01:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=3852.42s)]
*  Ooh, it's nice there. [[01:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=3853.42s)]

*  Oh yeah, oh yeah. [[01:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=3857.8199999999997s)]
*  It was fine dining. [[01:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=3858.8199999999997s)]
*  We had some steak, had like two bites of it. [[01:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=3860.66s)]
*  Everyone's trying to stay light. [[01:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=3864.58s)]
*  Yeah, the date doesn't eat much, huh? [[01:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=3865.8999999999996s)]
*  No, she felt some pressure, I guess. [[01:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=3868.5s)]
*  Hey, look. [[01:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=3871.58s)]
*  Yeah, a lot of them don't want to... [[01:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=3872.58s)]
*  I think women don't... [[01:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=3874.86s)]
*  I think... [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=3875.86s)]

*  That was fun. [[01:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=3883.1000000000004s)]
*  And then that was it. [[01:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=3884.1000000000004s)]
*  Go to some bars? [[01:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=3885.9s)]
*  Some bars. [[01:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=3886.9s)]

*  So it was a fun time. [[01:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=3891.54s)]
*  We both needed IVs in the morning. [[01:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=3894.42s)]
*  Really? [[01:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=3895.98s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=3896.98s)]
*  And was it a... [[01:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=3897.98s)]
*  I don't even want to be inappropriate. [[01:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=3898.98s)]
*  Was it like sleep in the same bed type of date? [[01:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=3901.06s)]
*  Or was it like a... [[01:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=3903.74s)]
*  Same room. [[01:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=3904.74s)]

*  How were you feeling? [[01:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=3923.4199999999996s)]
*  I was feeling butterflies. [[01:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=3924.74s)]
*  Butterflies with a little bit of the beer shit. [[01:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=3927.4199999999996s)]

*  Yeah. [[01:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=3936.8199999999997s)]

*  A lot of step dads and aggressive business lesbians will drink on flights, I noticed. [[01:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=3941.7s)]
*  I'm on flights all the time. [[01:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=3946.1s)]

*  Oh, I love it. [[01:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=3980.26s)]
*  It can't even catch a frisbee in its mouth yet. [[01:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=3981.26s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[01:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=3983.14s)]
*  We were stumbling. [[01:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=3984.14s)]
*  Don't know how to hold hands. [[01:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=3985.14s)]
*  Don't know how to walk together. [[01:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=3987.5s)]
*  I was trying to open doors. [[01:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=3989.54s)]
*  It's pretty hard when they're a fast walker. [[01:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=3991.3s)]
*  Calm down. [[01:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=3992.86s)]

*  first night or whatever. [[01:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=4028.54s)]

*  Women like seafood and they just like it, dude. [[01:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=4126.1s)]
*  You buy a girl a fish dinner, get her a couple fish medallions or however they cut it up. [[01:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=4131.26s)]

*  You know what I thought? [[01:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=4140.46s)]
*  I wonder if it would be cool to date a mermaid or not. [[01:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=4141.46s)]
*  That would be cool. [[01:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=4144.68s)]

*  Well just they're mermaid. [[01:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=4150.3s)]
*  What is a mermaid made out of? [[01:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=4151.3s)]
*  How much is it human and how much of is it fish? [[01:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=4152.46s)]
*  Can you bring that up, please? [[01:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=4155.12s)]
*  I'm guessing 45%. [[01:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=4156.12s)]
*  No, not 45%. [[01:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=4157.12s)]
*  It'd probably be 60% fish. [[01:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=4158.12s)]
*  Yeah, I'm guessing more 60% fish. [[01:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=4161.0599999999995s)]
*  Do you have a crush on any mermaids or something? [[01:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=4167.0599999999995s)]
*  No, I just thought I was just thinking about it, what it would really be like because there's [[01:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=4170.0599999999995s)]
*  always these kind of like romantic ideas of a mermaid, you know? [[01:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=4174.5199999999995s)]
*  But no one ever really thinks about the day to day of it. [[01:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=4178.48s)]
*  Like you're not going to be able to bring her home. [[01:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=4182.5199999999995s)]
*  There's not going to be any, I mean there'll be some intimacy, but there's no set. [[01:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=4186.12s)]
*  She doesn't have like a lower, so there's just... [[01:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=4190.96s)]
*  What's like she's dressed sexy, the fish scales are like latex, you know? [[01:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=4193.12s)]
*  Yeah, that's true. [[01:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=4197.96s)]
*  Great touch, great feeling. [[01:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=4199.96s)]
*  Right, but they don't have, they're just a fish from the bottom so you'd have to like, [[01:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=4201.5199999999995s)]
*  I think there's, yeah, there's a lot of, you could probably ride on her back underwater. [[01:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=4204.5199999999995s)]
*  That would be pretty cool. [[01:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=4209.5199999999995s)]
*  That would be cool. [[01:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=4210.5199999999995s)]
*  Look at that. [[01:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=4211.5199999999995s)]

*  But then what would happen is you'd fall in love, you'd bring her home, you'd get her [[01:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=4215.08s)]
*  a tank. [[01:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=4217.64s)]
*  You'd get her a tank? [[01:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=4219.240000000001s)]
*  That's the only way you could do it. [[01:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=4220.240000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=4221.72s)]
*  Yeah, you'd better have a swimming pool. [[01:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=4222.72s)]
*  Yeah, and look, yeah, maybe like the fifth year anniversary you get her a pool or whatever. [[01:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=4224.200000000001s)]
*  I don't think you start with a pool right out of the gate. [[01:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=4228.200000000001s)]

*  And it's the craziest place where people can just pee on each other like secretly. [[01:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=4242.68s)]
*  I always pee in the pool. [[01:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=4245.8s)]
*  No guilt, no survivor's remorse. [[01:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=4249.2s)]

*  You'd be the bartender and she would be the one on the other side. [[01:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=4265.6s)]
*  I think the bartender's probably, no, you give a guy four drinks and he doesn't move, [[01:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=4267.8s)]
*  he's pissing the whole time. [[01:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=4273.16s)]
*  He's letting it rip. [[01:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=4275.64s)]
*  Yeah, they should actually have like a little piss cop or whatever that swims up. [[01:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=4276.64s)]
*  Oh yeah, maybe a catheter or something. [[01:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=4279.64s)]
*  Something, yeah, that you can attach right in. [[01:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=4282.08s)]

*  It was more like I was just making shit up as I'm doing stuff. [[01:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=5159.28s)]
*  Half of them are like audible calls like Tuesday or whatever. [[01:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=5163.68s)]

*  But I got that from when I first started. [[01:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=5172.5199999999995s)]
*  I was used to, I did my first stream. [[01:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=5175.84s)]
*  I had like 12 people. [[01:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=5178.28s)]
*  It was mostly my friends and stuff. [[01:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=5179.48s)]
*  But I turned off the announcer on Madden and send the games. [[01:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=5181.04s)]
*  And that's how I kind of started getting into it. [[01:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=5186.2s)]
*  Like, we all announced it like it's a game and then we had a line on it and like some [[01:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=5189.32s)]
*  of them would bet it and stuff. [[01:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=5192.719999999999s)]
*  And like, it's pretty fun. [[01:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=5194.28s)]
*  All of them go to like overtime. [[01:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=5196.12s)]
*  It's pretty cool. [[01:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=5197.12s)]
*  Oh, so all of the games you would and you would just you could MC your own game like [[01:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=5198.12s)]
*  you could be your own. [[01:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=5201.88s)]
*  So you can like take two teams. [[01:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=5202.88s)]
*  No one's playing with them. [[01:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=5204.719999999999s)]
*  You just turn off the announcer. [[01:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=5205.84s)]
*  And then it was just me announcing. [[01:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=5207.84s)]
*  And it was like a random football game. [[01:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=5209.400000000001s)]

*  We did it. [[01:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=5214.68s)]
*  I did it for like a tournament and the way we see you picked your teams and then we seeded [[01:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=5215.68s)]
*  it and that's how you had your draft order for the fantasy draft. [[01:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=5218.84s)]
*  Oh, nice. [[01:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=5221.64s)]

*  Yeah. [[01:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=5223.84s)]
*  It was exhausting though. [[01:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=5224.84s)]
*  Those games are like 30 minutes and I did probably 20 of them. [[01:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=5225.84s)]

*  That's why I wear these air ball marks. [[01:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=5715.74s)]
*  No one wants to rip these things off my feet. [[01:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=5717.74s)]

*  Yeah. [[01:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=5725.74s)]
*  They had this video that of Tupac that I did see when he was young. [[01:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=5726.74s)]
*  Apparently, he was allegedly a homosexual male, and I didn't know that. [[01:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=5729.74s)]
*  Okay, my name is Tupac Shakur, and I attend Tamapai High School, and I'm 17 years old. [[01:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=5732.74s)]
*  Do you like being 17? [[01:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=5739.74s)]
*  17 is such a weird age. [[01:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=5742.74s)]
*  It's such an end-of-the-middle age. [[01:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=5744.74s)]
*  You're not 18 yet, and you're older than 16. [[01:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=5746.74s)]
*  But I like it. [[01:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=5749.74s)]
*  It's nice. [[01:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=5750.74s)]
*  They never really push him like that. [[01:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=5751.74s)]
*  The energy about him is always just a little bit more like that he was a gangster rapper. [[01:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=5753.74s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=5760.74s)]
*  You know? [[01:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=5761.74s)]
*  Maybe sometimes they take videos out of context. [[01:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=5762.74s)]
*  That could be true. [[01:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=5765.74s)]
*  I mean, this could be AI. [[01:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=5766.74s)]
*  It could be. [[01:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=5767.74s)]
*  But even then, I think it's just interesting. [[01:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=5768.74s)]
*  I think for years I've never heard anybody say this, and then now everybody's been talking about this video. [[01:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=5772.74s)]
*  Yeah, people like to say that stuff now. [[01:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=5776.74s)]
*  Yeah, the second somebody has any success, also they're gay. [[01:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=5778.74s)]
*  There's also a lot of new black gay people since the Diddy thing suddenly everybody who's black is accusing everybody else of being gay, I feel like. [[01:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=5781.74s)]
*  It's just kind of wild. [[01:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=5789.74s)]
*  I think a lot of that stuff just in the black community right now is kind of wild, you know? [[01:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=5790.74s)]
*  With a lot of just everybody accusing each other of being gay. [[01:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZbQb9cl72M&t=5794.74s)]
