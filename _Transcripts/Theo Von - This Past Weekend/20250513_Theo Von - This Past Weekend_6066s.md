*  Do not rub it in my nose. But how about this? [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=150.88s)]
*  I was like, how about this? You keep drinking it and let me put, [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=155.6s)]

*  That guy was on a lot, man. But it, yeah, it smelled like very beautiful peanut flavored peanut. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=166.4s)]
*  Tell me about it. It's peanut, peanut flavored tequila, peanut flavored tequila, peanut, peanut [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=172.64000000000001s)]
*  flavored tequila, peanut butter, peanut butter flavored tequila. Cause just peanut flavored is [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=177.6s)]
*  like totally different. Yeah. And every year it kills like one person on an airplane. There's [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=182.4s)]
*  super funny talking about Mexican people went down there to tequila for it. And, um, to, to, to, [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=186.4s)]
*  to tequila, the city, it might be a country. No, it's a city. Guadalajara is the, [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=192.16s)]
*  it's just a neighboring city that you fly into. But then you go to tequila and at that place, [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=199.28s)]
*  they don't have, they don't eat peanut butter and they don't know how to DAP either. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=205.11999999999998s)]
*  They don't know how to DAP you up. No dude. Mexican people, if you do this to them, [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=208.88s)]
*  they have no clue what you're doing. That's crazy. They have no idea. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=212.39999999999998s)]
*  Yeah. I'm not saying Mexican Americans who, who live here now, they probably can DAP fine. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=216.24s)]
*  Those are called Chicanos. They can probably DAP fine. But when you go down there, it's just not a [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=220.88s)]
*  thing. Dude, I think the exchange rate gets lost. I think if you're coming across that border, [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=224.72s)]
*  there's no time to DAP. People are, you know, can't, they're struggling. They're getting [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=228.72s)]
*  climbing uphill or up like they're wet. The kids haven't slept or whatever. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=233.60000000000002s)]
*  I think that's where they probably lose it. There's not time. Yeah. There's no, dude, there's no two [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=238.48000000000002s)]

*  I think, dude, I think Mexican people are probably the most liked group of people. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=251.76s)]
*  For sure. I don't know anyone who doesn't like Mexican people. We did a show the other night [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=256.64s)]
*  and they had a guy in the front. He was Mexican or alleged Mexican or whatever. Or I don't know what [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=260.08s)]

*  What was he doing? Oh, nothing. I don't know. He's just fucking looking for something. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=288.64s)]
*  No, he was, he was just at the show, but I was like, give a round of applause for Mexican people, [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=293.59999999999997s)]

*  yeah, it's like, I think when you work for yourself or work with people in a small group, you, [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=1638.96s)]
*  you have to, you have to stay pretty hands on. Like if you started letting somebody else edit [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=1643.52s)]
*  your episode, it's impossible. It's impossible. I have an editor, Tom, who's great, but we've worked [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=1647.12s)]
*  together for so many years now and we correspond. I mean, we go through notes and notes and it's a [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=1652.56s)]
*  huge process. And even he, if he was left to his own devices, he would do a great job on the episode. [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=1657.92s)]
*  It would be great. Maybe people wouldn't even know, but I would, to me, it's like I would do [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=1663.1200000000001s)]

*  he doesn't have an ego. I feel like a lot of, everyone has egos. I mean, he's just like a nice [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=1673.76s)]
*  gem of a person. But when you're corresponding and on some creative and I'm giving notes, [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=1679.12s)]
*  do this, do this, it'll be really easy to be offended. If you're, he's a really creative guy, [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=1684.08s)]
*  right? You know, so it's like, if you're a creative person, you have your own ideas of how you want [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=1688.6399999999999s)]
*  things done and he has his own ideas. He can provide those, but then he also doesn't get [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=1692.24s)]
*  butt hurt if I'm saying, I don't think that's good, which is, I think it's such a rare find. [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=1696.8799999999999s)]
*  Oh, I think you're right. And I think also a big thing is that editors, I mean, let's give a round [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=1701.2s)]
*  of applause for editors. They are, because people are just yelling at them. No one appreciates, [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=1705.84s)]
*  they're like the long snappers of media. Oh yeah. Oh, if you saw an editor across the street and [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=1713.76s)]
*  you were walking by, he'd be like, oh, look at this desperate. Then you just get into your car and go [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=1719.04s)]
*  home to your husband. No, they are, they are, they're the icebergs of our planet really. [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=1725.84s)]
*  They're out there by themselves. And yeah, they're involved with cold water, but nobody thinks about [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=1738.9599999999998s)]
*  them like that. Everybody thinks like they're about to sink a ship. Think about that being [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=1744.6399999999999s)]
*  iceberg. The only thing they're known for basically is every now and then, like somebody sees a [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=1750.16s)]
*  polar bear, one of them, but really the thing they're known for most is sinking that boat. [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=1756.48s)]
*  Isn't that crazy? The one thing that can be your whole life can get you just into one thing, [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=1762.96s)]
*  one moment. Yeah, I was thinking about that yesterday. Just how one, well, this is actually [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=1767.68s)]

*  want. Yeah. But you can't leave if you don't pay. Yep. So I'll be like, bring the check first. [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=1921.68s)]
*  Bring the check first. Bring the fucking check. Sometimes I'll leave then. I don't even really [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=1926.3200000000002s)]
*  want to fucking be here. I could make a smoothie at home. Get your rocks off. Just pay that check. [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=1932.16s)]
*  Yeah, I pay that check. I'll tip that guy. Um, are you a good tipper? I am. You are? I think I am. [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=1936.8s)]
*  I like doing it. Yeah, I feel good about it. You know, also I make fair, you know, I make good [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=1943.04s)]
*  money. So it'd be weird if I didn't tip good, I feel like. But yeah, I think it's fun. I don't [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=1948.72s)]
*  understand people who are dumb. At least 20%, I feel like that's. Yeah. I get the argument, [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=1954.48s)]
*  I guess, for people being like, well, they didn't do anything. But at the same time, like, that's [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=1961.3600000000001s)]
*  their job. Yeah, you knew when you went in there. Yeah, like, it's kind of on you that they, you [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=1966.4s)]
*  know, you're paying them for nothing. Um, fuck, what were we talking about just a second ago? [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=1972.24s)]
*  Greta. Is this a real interview? Thurnberg. I feel like I'm back on your show. Don't say that, man. [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=1978.8s)]
*  Don't say that. We should make a separate episode of Sunday out of this. [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=1984.24s)]
*  What is you, could you cut together a bonus episode of Sunday out of this, you think? Yeah, easily. [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=1990.0s)]
*  Not easily be fucking really hard. But that's what's amazing about your show. You go in there, [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=1994.72s)]
*  you sit in there, a couple things come up, you accuse people of something, you make a face or two, [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=1998.48s)]
*  you don't know if you have bells, Paul's here, if you're asking a question. And then, [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=2003.04s)]
*  and then you send me somebody home. I know every time you wrap up, everyone's like, [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=2007.6s)]
*  yeah, because I don't shoot it like this. I don't shoot it like a free flowing conversation. [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=2014.48s)]
*  Because I know how it's going to edit. So I just like, that's a waste of time to even do all those [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=2019.28s)]
*  segues and in middlemen parts of the conversation, I skip right to the meat. Yeah. It's a [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=2023.84s)]
*  very awkward conversation. Oh, it's a good point. You do. You do skip right to the meat, dude. [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=2028.32s)]
*  What do you, yeah. Do you think Diddy, what do you think happened there? [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=2033.12s)]
*  With Diddy? Well, they said, you know, with that Diddy thing, they said they just found, [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=2037.52s)]
*  they were spicing the baby oil. Do you see that? No. Bring it up. Spiced baby oil. [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=2041.6s)]
*  Diddy spiced baby oil. Sean Diddy combs baby oil was allegedly laced with date rape drug. [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=2048.7999999999997s)]
*  The allegations against Sean Diddy, he did combs continued amount. While the rapper has been in [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=2055.36s)]
*  jail since September, arrest faces charges of sex trafficking. In a recent slew of filings obtained [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=2064.48s)]
*  by E news, one plaintiff identified as Jane Doe in the docs alleges the baby oil found in combs house [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=2068.96s)]
*  was laced with Rohippinol or GHB, which often referred to as the date rape drug. Wow. [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=2073.84s)]
*  Or also referred to as an hors d'oeuvre if you're going to see Ruth Badergast. [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=2079.84s)]
*  So, who's drinking baby oil? Nobody. They're rubbing it on and it goes into their skin. [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=2085.52s)]
*  Oh, it gets in their skin. Yeah. Is that really a thing? Stuff can go into your [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=2092.08s)]
*  body through your body? That I don't know, buddy. [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=2096.8s)]
*  Because think about all the things that go on your skin. Oh, totally. I mean, [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=2101.1200000000003s)]
*  like is my shirt going into my skin? Yeah. In some ways. Well, they say there's some, [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=2106.88s)]
*  they say that cotton used to like, it used to be better for our skin. And then we started using [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=2112.56s)]
*  all these synthetic products. And that's why a lot of people, some people believe that like some of [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=2117.04s)]
*  the synthetic products could be especially wrapped around your genitalia, like your underpants could [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=2121.68s)]
*  be causing a lot of issues in the world. Really? Like causing like autism or like the anus thing [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=2125.92s)]
*  with the anus and the scrotum or whatever are getting shorter. Is it really? I don't know. I [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=2134.08s)]
*  just listened to Joe Rogan say that the perineum or whatever it's called. Yes, the perineum. [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=2138.64s)]
*  Great word by you. The perineum is getting shorter. Shrinking. They need to put some [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=2142.56s)]
*  fucking Christmas trees out there because the coastline in Louisiana is fucking disappearing. [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=2146.08s)]
*  And every year they come get our Christmas tree, dude. What do you mean coastline? There's a beach [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=2150.4s)]
*  in Louisiana. I've never thought about that in my life, but I never thought there'd be about a beach [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=2154.7999999999997s)]
*  in Louisiana. I'll say this. If you put your hair under water down there and home, it comes up corn [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=2161.2799999999997s)]
*  road. You'll have a little crab at the end of it just figuring that shit out, bro. So it definitely [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=2165.12s)]
*  has powers in the water. I don't know. I don't think there's a beach. Look up that. Are underpants, [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=2172.88s)]
*  look up non-cotton underpants causing [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=2181.7599999999998s)]
*  mental disorder. This just says cotton underwear make a difference even if it's ugly. I don't care [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=2188.3199999999997s)]
*  about the style, brother. Nevermind. That was a wild ride. This is the worst interview I've ever [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=2198.8799999999997s)]
*  been on. No, it's not, dude. Dude, keep believing in yourself. Okay, sorry. You're doing good. [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=2205.2799999999997s)]
*  You're right. We're doing good. We just haven't talked about anything important or [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=2212.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's kind of it, I guess. We haven't said anything really of any significance. [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=2215.12s)]
*  We haven't said anything. No, we should be talking about something. Well, when you start to think [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=2217.8399999999997s)]
*  about being like, because now that you're doing your own thing, do you feel like you're more [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=2224.64s)]
*  capable to do something new? Tell me about something like branching out on your own, [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=2228.08s)]
*  like the fears of it and stuff like that. And did you think it would be okay? Do you think [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=2232.72s)]
*  it would fail? Do you have any real fears about it? Because I think a lot of people work with [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=2236.08s)]
*  somebody or under an umbrella and then they go out and do their own thing. [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=2240.64s)]
*  Yeah. I think, well, the thing that was how Barstool was set up was Dave is very hands off. [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=2243.6s)]
*  So he doesn't tell you what you should be doing when you start doing what you're doing. He doesn't [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=2249.44s)]
*  talk to you. You really just go complete non-communication with him 100% of the time. [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=2254.8799999999997s)]
*  What that culture breeds, I think, is like a kind of an entrepreneurial spirit, I guess, [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=2261.2s)]
*  the people who are successful there at Barstool, because you have to be. And they have the resources. [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=2268.24s)]
*  Obviously, they're taking the risk on you by paying your salary because they're going to pay you if [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=2274.08s)]
*  your content sucks or if your brand loses the brand deal or whatever. Like every two weeks, [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=2279.3599999999997s)]
*  you're getting paid. So they're taking that chance. And obviously, if you do well, they have the [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=2284.64s)]
*  upside. But it's really, it's a place where I was able to kind of, they gave me the resources, [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=2288.24s)]
*  but I was able to kind of build out. I started working with Tom, who's my editor, and we worked [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=2295.2s)]
*  together for years to develop the camaraderie of my producer, Kelsey, who you've met. We started [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=2298.8799999999997s)]
*  working together, developed camaraderie. So we had to make my own little business inside of Barstool. [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=2303.9199999999996s)]
*  Right. So going out and doing my own thing really was pretty much exactly the same because I already [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=2308.0s)]
*  had my business inside of Barstool, inside of the bigger business. Oh, yeah. But I would like to do [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=2312.72s)]
*  some other stuff outside of Sunday Conversation. I don't know what. I mean, how was your movie [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=2319.6s)]
*  experience? I've heard that it's kind of boring shooting a movie. Oh, yeah. It's boring. [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=2323.84s)]
*  I like the revolutions I can do on Sunday. I can put out one Sunday a week. It's a lot of work to [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=2331.2000000000003s)]
*  get it out once a week, but we can do it. And then it's like, you move on to the next thing. [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=2336.5600000000004s)]
*  It's like you had a stinker, you can still move on and have a go in the next week. Yeah. And things [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=2339.6000000000004s)]
*  happen so fast now, too. Yeah. How I even consume, how everyone consumes content is like. It's so [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=2343.76s)]
*  fast. It's like, you know, in the first couple seconds, I want to keep watching this or not. [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=2350.56s)]
*  And sometimes it's interesting. It's like something will just pique your interest. And sometimes it [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=2353.84s)]
*  can be the same thing on the next day and it will not pique your interest. But then two days later, [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=2357.04s)]
*  it'll pique your interest again. I think it's very fascinating. And I'm sure there's a lot of like [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=2360.56s)]
*  coding is so they're figuring that out. And they just keep hooking you or finding different ways [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=2365.2799999999997s)]
*  to hook you. It's kind of crazy, though. You'll go down some rabbit holes and with the algorithm, [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=2370.4s)]
*  and the algorithm can lead you to do some crazy stuff. Like what? Like want to do crime, I'll say. [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=2375.2799999999997s)]
*  I want to do crime because the algorithm is like, oh, yeah. So you mingle it over there. You want [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=2383.7599999999998s)]
*  another hit of that fucking smack. Yeah. I mean, you want another fucking couple of hot doses of [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=2388.3199999999997s)]
*  fucking Gaza core. Charlie Kirk. Oh, Jesus Christ. Next thing you know, you get it just gets crazy. [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=2392.7999999999997s)]
*  And then you're just choking out your neighbor. Yeah, I do feel like especially Twitter X, [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=2402.08s)]
*  especially X feeds me stuff I don't want to see. Like the algorithm builds out just like you're [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=2407.7599999999998s)]
*  saying, if you like to doom scrolling or whatever, you're on your phone for too long. It's not that [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=2414.4s)]
*  long before you're seeing stuff. You don't I don't relate to it at all. Imagine there's just a wheel [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=2418.4s)]
*  somewhere you could spin it. But one of the options are 11 out of 14 of the options were bankruptcy, [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=2423.84s)]
*  violence, machete attacks, racism, at least on Instagram. If you do it for a long time, [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=2430.64s)]
*  you end up with boobs. Yeah. If you stay on Instagram for a long time, you end up at boobs. [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=2435.28s)]
*  Oh, yeah, you do. Well, Twitter, you end up as b-holes or whatever, and like Christmas b-holes [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=2440.24s)]
*  and all that. Like, it's Christmas. Can you do at least two days a year without b-holes on Twitter? [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=2445.68s)]
*  That is I don't know. They got to do. I feel so bad for the kids growing up. How much porn [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=2454.24s)]
*  you do? You don't have a choice in life if you want to watch porn. Right. We used to have a [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=2460.16s)]
*  choice, at least like you used to have the bike to get it or whatever. Now you. Yeah, you have that. [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=2464.8799999999997s)]
*  It's insane. It's insane. It's very sad. One. It should be a crime. Yeah. One kid just came out [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=2471.12s)]
*  and said he found his sister on OnlyFans and it broke his heart. You see that video? Man, [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=2475.7599999999998s)]
*  it's pretty sad. You don't want to show it because they're children, but just crazy to see people [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=2480.64s)]
*  and think about that. Dude, I saw a stat. It was I think one in every 12 girls are on OnlyFans. [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=2484.48s)]
*  But is that a lie? Let's look it up. What percentage of women are on OnlyFans? I mean, that's [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=2493.12s)]
*  nuts. That's nuts. But there's so much money. And if you, I guess if you just want to make money, [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=2499.04s)]
*  you don't care about anything else in the world besides making money. Bad way to live. [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=2503.52s)]

*  Four. What date is that? That's 2023. Find me something similar that's updated if you can. [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=2514.08s)]
*  Give me some updated information. What percentage? Like everything just feels like my wits end. [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=2520.96s)]
*  My axle just broke on my freaking Cybertruck. No way. Yeah. I parked. I was like, it feels like [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=2528.2400000000002s)]
*  it's weird turning. I go look and the fucking knackle's broken. This is a bad question. What is [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=2533.6800000000003s)]
*  that? Cybertruck. Axle. Oh, axle. It's like, it is a brand. It's like this guy. Break it up. [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=2537.76s)]
*  Is it like this? Yeah. It's like, that's what it sounds like. Is this? Yes. Yeah. It's like a lower [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=2548.8s)]

*  It ain't changing. You ever get under a car? Oh yeah, dude. Oh, I'll tell you this. I used [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=2569.7599999999998s)]
*  to have a Ford Escort, right? And this bitch would fucking go. Dude, sometimes it would take off, [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=2575.4399999999996s)]
*  right? You're going to be in it, right? This is before they had self-driving cars or whatever. [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=2579.9199999999996s)]
*  But it was just the throttle or whatever was just loose or unloose or whatever. I don't [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=2583.04s)]
*  remember what it was, tight or loose. And that bitch you'd park it, dude. We'd go like an extra [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=2588.48s)]
*  12 feet. After you got out that bitch, it would just, it would do a jolt and rev. It had a thing. [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=2592.96s)]
*  It had like this kind of civil war feature or whatever. But after you got out, sometimes it [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=2598.96s)]
*  would, there would be a combustion and then it would out of the back catalytic converter out of [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=2603.44s)]
*  the exhaust pipe. So my buddy Bo would always get to stand back there and then he'd be like, oh, [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=2609.6s)]
*  I just worked it like I got shot every time. [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=2614.48s)]
*  Dude, you know that on your, today I was coming over to the house. On your Google maps is your [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=2618.0s)]
*  truck. Like it shows your house and it shows your truck and it shows you in it. You're on your Google [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=2624.96s)]
*  maps. Really? If you type in your address, which we won't say, you're on there. Someone's just coming [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=2631.44s)]
*  by taking pics. Oh, well it's very scary. Dude, things get scary these days. I saw a video myself [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=2639.44s)]
*  the other day. It's driving. Somebody drove alongside and probably 30 seconds just filmed me. [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=2643.84s)]
*  So yeah, it just, it's okay. But it just, you're like, it starts to make you super paranoid. [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=2648.16s)]
*  How was Bridgestone doing two nights there or two days, two shows? That's, that's awesome. Or does [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=2653.68s)]
*  it feel just like a normal show? I'll just ask because it's here in Nashville. It felt like a [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=2658.48s)]
*  mix. I think it's just been a long year, so everything almost starts to feel the same time [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=2662.0s)]
*  sometimes. But I was excited that, that a lot of people I knew were going. [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=2666.24s)]
*  I did the shows longer than usual. I probably should have tightened it up a little bit, [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=2673.3599999999997s)]
*  but I just wanted to be up there. You know, I was trying to think of things to thank people or trying [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=2677.12s)]
*  to localize stuff if I could at certain points. Yeah, it's just why I mean, you just couldn't even [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=2681.6s)]
*  believe, you know, I remember the first show that I ever went to over there was, who's that guy? [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=2688.0s)]
*  Oh, Gwen Stefani's husband. And after the show, my buddy Eddie was filming me and he's like, [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=2693.9199999999996s)]
*  you're going to play here one day? And I was like, I'm not playing here, dude. You're out of your mind. [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=2702.8799999999997s)]
*  And then, so he sent me that video about a week ago. It's pretty cool. That is cool. [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=2706.72s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, just bonkers. So I think that was fun. I was, I thought the shows went pretty good. [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=2713.2799999999997s)]
*  So I was glad that everybody came out and laugh. I was just like, yeah, you just want it to go good [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=2717.3599999999997s)]
*  because also that's a show. You have to see those people around town or you have to wonder [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=2721.6s)]
*  if everybody you ran into could have been one of those people that was at that show. [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=2725.6s)]
*  And so that was one part that was really exciting about it, man. And you're going up against Metallica. [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=2729.2799999999997s)]
*  Oh, that's true. Huh? Yeah. Which is pretty good. [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=2733.7599999999998s)]
*  Imagine having an opportunity to go see Metallica and choosing to go see you. [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=2743.04s)]
*  So these blacks. I was like, come on, dude. Wow. Oh man. You're right about that, dude. [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=2751.6s)]
*  I got to come see you in, I got to come watch you in Cork. Oh yeah. Ireland. That was fun. [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=2762.4s)]
*  I forgot about that. That was fun. That was cool. Wasn't it? That was my buddy's wedding. [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=2769.6s)]
*  My buddy Scotty's in town tonight. They're going to see Rufus Assault. No way. Yeah. [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=2773.92s)]
*  I thought about having him come by the house, but my truck broke down. I cried for a little bit and [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=2778.16s)]
*  I got kind of scared and I just hurried back home. Yeah. Yeah. One bad axle, dude. Oh dude, [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=2782.8s)]
*  what do you think about Bill Belichick's girlfriend? What's the word down there? Because [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=2789.84s)]
*  he lives in Florida, doesn't he? He lives in, I think Nantucket or obviously Chapel Hill now, but. [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=2792.4s)]
*  Okay. North Florida or whatever. But he's going to your own mutter. [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=2799.84s)]
*  Yeah. And it's kind of crazy. I mean, it's like. People are talking about the program, [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=2804.64s)]
*  so that's a positive, right? Well, to me, college football is 100,000% about the players. I mean, [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=2810.72s)]
*  all football is, but especially college football. And I think Kim Cumming, we got a big budget [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=2817.12s)]
*  increase for what we were willing to give NIO players or the NIO money for like guys to recruit. [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=2822.8799999999997s)]
*  So you think Boosters followed him? I think that we really raised a lot of money. I don't know what [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=2829.68s)]
*  the figure is, but I want to say it was like 30 million bucks or something. It was like kind of [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=2833.76s)]
*  like the, and I don't know if that includes the coaches or what, but it was a huge figure that [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=2837.28s)]
*  you would think we would be able to go out and get like five star quarterback, five star whatever. [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=2842.0s)]
*  And I haven't seen us signing any five stars yet, but that could just be the period of the year [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=2847.0400000000004s)]
*  we're in. And my thing is if he signs those five stars, it doesn't matter about his girlfriend. And [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=2852.6400000000003s)]
*  if he doesn't sign those five stars, it doesn't matter about his girlfriend because we're going [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=2857.92s)]
*  to be asked no matter what his girlfriend says. I mean, that's the truth. Dude, we have to sign [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=2861.28s)]
*  good players and pay them. I thought that Nico, I'm a Tennessee football fan for college. I mean, [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=2867.84s)]
*  obviously I played at Carolina, so I root for Carolina as well, but Tennessee is who I grew up [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=2872.6400000000003s)]
*  on and they didn't pay Nico, or that's a story. They didn't pay their quarterback. He wanted like [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=2876.8s)]
*  $4 million as a story and they're giving him two. And so they said, get out of here. I think it's [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=2882.32s)]
*  crazy. I think pay him. Everyone was on Tennessee side. Everyone thought Nico was an idiot. And [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=2887.28s)]
*  maybe that's true, but to me, I would have liked to see Tennessee just pay up. He's a freshman. He [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=2892.88s)]
*  took you, his real freshman year, he beat Clemson in the first time he ever played in the whatever, [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=2897.84s)]
*  Orange Bowl or something. And then last year was his redshirt freshman year. He took Tennessee to [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=2903.76s)]
*  the playoffs. And this guy's, in my opinion, could be the number one overall draft pick. And they're [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=2907.52s)]
*  talking about 2 million bucks with him. He probably makes a hundred million dollars for the university. [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=2912.2400000000002s)]
*  Him being on the field, having a good team, playoff competitive. I mean, you've been down there. [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=2916.72s)]
*  Oh, it's unbelievable. People were certainly excited about him the year before. I remember [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=2920.48s)]
*  when he got in in the bowl game the year before, didn't he have to play the bowl game? Yeah, Clemson, [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=2924.64s)]
*  he beat Clemson. Right. So people were stoked. They're like, put him in, you know, everybody was [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=2929.04s)]
*  excited. Even that year when they were losing to Georgia late in the season, they're like, put him [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=2934.08s)]
*  in. I think he was like the number one overall recruit. People were excited and he did well. [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=2938.56s)]
*  You're right. He's only one year. You can't, you know, you can't expect guys just to, [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=2943.36s)]
*  or maybe now people can. People are saying now though, I think this is it. People are saying now [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=2950.8s)]
*  we're putting our money in, we better get a return on it fast. Right. That's so I think that's part [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=2955.2000000000003s)]
*  of the mindset probably doesn't help the whole equation. Right. But a lot of these guys, Lane [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=2961.52s)]
*  Kiffin was telling them, you go through one section of the portal time and then they haven't even played [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=2965.6s)]
*  any ball yet. There's another portal period. And they're like, you know what? You gave us two [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=2970.16s)]
*  million. We want four million. We haven't done anything. It's insane. They had to fix it. College [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=2974.8799999999997s)]
*  football is fucked right now. So that's pretty crazy that the fact that that's happening, you know. [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=2979.52s)]
*  Dude, they got rid of walk ons. There's no more walk ons in college football. Like I was, I walked [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=2984.3199999999997s)]
*  on to the University of North Carolina and my, you were loitering. They said I also, one of the, [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=2989.44s)]
*  an interview with a former coach said this guy was loitering. Yeah, they hated me while I was there. [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=2995.12s)]
*  But dude, there's no walk ons anymore. Like our team, our best, maybe not our best players, but [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=2998.64s)]
*  our team captain, some of our best players were walk ons. Like I came in with my class of fellow [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=3004.08s)]
*  guys, every single one of them went on to win a scholarship. A lot of them went to NFL. Yeah. And [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=3010.72s)]
*  it's like they were like the meat of the team or the glue of the team. And they don't even have [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=3015.44s)]
*  that anymore because they had to cut the roster down. They got to pay all these guys. And that's [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=3020.4s)]
*  sad to me. Is that true? Has NIL, Google that please. Has NIL eliminated the possibility of walk ons [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=3025.92s)]
*  or lowered the number of walk ons on teams? I think it's, I think they don't even do it anymore. [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=3034.96s)]
*  I really don't think they even take walk ons. I think it's the, the death of the walk on. Okay. [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=3039.68s)]
*  Yes. The new NCA roster limits, including the house settlement have effectively reduced the [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=3045.76s)]
*  number of walk on opportunities in college sports, particularly football while teams still have non [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=3051.6s)]
*  scholarship players walk ons. The total roster sizes, captain 105, significantly reducing the [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=3056.24s)]
*  space for them. Wow. So the movie Hoosiers years from now, people will watch Hoosiers and be like, [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=3061.2s)]
*  who the fuck is that dude? Rudy. Yeah. But it won't even understand. Yeah. Yeah. It's, it's, [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=3067.68s)]
*  it is sad, man. And then it is, it definitely takes away a lot of the heart of it. Well, dude, also [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=3074.24s)]
*  just like, I just had such an awesome, positive experience being in the locker room for four years, [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=3078.56s)]
*  the same guys going through it. You have these big aspirational dreams. You're going to make the, see [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=3083.68s)]
*  the field, never see the field, but you're, you're, you had a, I had a great time and that doesn't [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=3087.52s)]
*  happen anymore. Not only because there's not walk ons, but also because they, there's no, they don't, [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=3093.7599999999998s)]
*  why would you cultivate a backup if you're the coach? If he's just about to transfer on your ass [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=3100.16s)]
*  soon as the season's over, your starter's probably going to transfer. These guys are playing on a [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=3105.12s)]
*  different team every year, sometimes two teams per year. So like there's no country, there's no [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=3108.96s)]
*  locker room vibe. They're all just like trying to get, get the cash. There has to be a way. People [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=3114.88s)]
*  are acting like, well, we had it better back then and now it's like totally destroyed. It's like, [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=3119.3599999999997s)]
*  is there no creative problem solving to figure out how we can get these guys some cash? And also [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=3124.08s)]
*  like, is there no middle ground here that we can work with? [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=3129.04s)]
*  They'd have like, can we just, okay, you have to stay, you can sit out. The argument has always [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=3133.2799999999997s)]
*  been you can't transfer. And then you have to sit out of you. That's how it used to be. Now you can [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=3138.56s)]
*  transfer and play immediately. I think you should have to sit out of here. And they say, well, [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=3144.0s)]
*  cause that'll hold them off. That's the hell it used to be. Right. Cause he got to say, [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=3147.7599999999998s)]
*  so you have to put your, at least you gotta show up for where you are. Yeah. And then the argument [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=3151.2s)]
*  against it was, well, coaches can just leave and then, you know, you're left with a coach that you [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=3156.0s)]
*  didn't really sign up to play for. Well, then make an exception. And if that's the coach leaves, [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=3160.56s)]
*  then you can go and you can do it. People are acting like these, it's like, it's a pretty simple, [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=3164.8s)]
*  but then this will start to happen. A coach will leave and he'll make a deal with the players. And [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=3169.28s)]
*  then the player will follow them. It'll be like a deal that they make. Yeah. Which is it, which is [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=3172.96s)]
*  wrong with that, right? That's part of the deal. That's part of it. If those are his players. So [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=3177.04s)]
*  yeah, I think there's a lot, obviously even us trying to look at it, there's a lot of little [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=3180.96s)]
*  sides to it, man. Yeah. But you're right. It does start to, it starts to kind of break the heart of [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=3184.72s)]
*  the fan, you know, cause you're kind of the one that loses in the end is just the value of being [[00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=3191.12s)]
*  a fan. It all just becomes this kind of capitalist thing. But for years, those places, the university [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=3196.56s)]
*  was making so much money and they weren't even setting aside, like set aside the money for 10 [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=3201.2799999999997s)]
*  years later. Every player gets a money. I'm saying like there should be money. It's like, maybe you [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=3206.3999999999996s)]
*  don't give it to them now, but you five years from now, they're going to get paid, you know? Or when [[00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=3210.7999999999997s)]
*  they graduate or when they're done at college, you know? But there's, there just has to be a way. [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=3214.24s)]
*  And it does in sports fans. I mean, I grew up a Tennessee football fan, SEC football. There's no [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=3218.56s)]
*  fans like that because in NFL, you can't go, you can't play for the team or go to the team [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=3224.7999999999997s)]

*  Oh, Riley Mao's here, dude. Can you give some waters for us, Riley? [[01:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=3669.92s)]
*  I'll take a- I mean, this is cool with me. [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=3674.4s)]
*  It is? [[01:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=3675.68s)]
*  No, I just love to have a water. Usually we have them out here. [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=3676.74s)]
*  Riley? [[01:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=3679.8599999999997s)]
*  I was not aware of- [[01:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=3680.4199999999996s)]
*  What do you mean? You've worked on- you've definitely worked on at least 50 episodes of this show. [[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=3682.5s)]
*  Yeah, Riley told me before he told you about his coming. [[01:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=3688.66s)]
*  Riley Mao's here. Let's get a gander at him first, man. We got to put these headies on. [[01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=3692.98s)]
*  Riley Mao, huh? How you doing, huh? [[01:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=3698.98s)]
*  Good. [[01:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=3703.3799999999997s)]
*  What's going on with you, brother? We got Caleb Presley here to talk to you today. [[01:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=3704.44s)]
*  Ask you a couple of questions. I know you're- haven't spoken to you in almost eight months. [[01:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=3707.4s)]
*  Yeah, it's been a minute. [[01:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=3712.76s)]
*  Nice. [[01:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=3714.76s)]
*  Riley, what kind of car is your truck? [[01:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=3717.8s)]
*  Let's say a Hyundai Santa Cruz. [[01:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=3721.0s)]
*  Ooh, Japanese- or not Japanese. Hyundai is Japanese and Santa Cruz is California. [[01:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=3723.6400000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=3731.56s)]
*  Have you been noticed? I know that you had a- you told me, [[01:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=3732.84s)]
*  and I think you've said it publicly now, that you came, right? [[01:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=3737.4s)]
*  I have. [[01:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=3741.0s)]
*  Well guys, let's not just say that out because people don't know that he- Riley was- [[01:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=3741.72s)]
*  he hadn't ejaculated until- what age did you finally get that out of you, Riley? [[01:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=3746.52s)]
*  25. [[01:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=3752.6s)]
*  Wow. [[01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=3753.56s)]
*  The uncreamable yellow egg they called him, huh? [[01:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=3755.32s)]
*  That little- that little baby quail over there, boy. Unbustable. [[01:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=3758.2s)]
*  Dude, so what's happened since then, Riley? Have you been- are you back at the- not coming? [[01:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=3767.08s)]
*  Or are you- now are you just constantly coming? [[01:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=3773.3199999999997s)]
*  But hold on, before you answer that, I do want to say this. [[01:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=3775.48s)]
*  He didn't even come to any music when it happened the first time. [[01:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=3777.3999999999996s)]
*  Did you, Riley? [[01:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=3781.0s)]
*  No. [[01:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=3782.2799999999997s)]
*  No? [[01:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=3782.9199999999996s)]
*  And how much came out? I'm not trying to be graphic. [[01:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=3784.12s)]
*  I actually don't- is that too much? [[01:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=3786.2799999999997s)]
*  I'll tell you this, he had to buy smaller shoes after. [[01:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=3787.9599999999996s)]
*  So enough to- enough to make him really uncomfortable in his current crocs. [[01:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=3792.6s)]
*  Bro, I mean 25 years, where was it going? [[01:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=3798.8399999999997s)]
*  Where was it going? Because I know for a fact, I don't care if he's lying or not about- [[01:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=3802.12s)]
*  I think he's lying about everything, but even if he's not lying, I know that the human body makes [[01:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=3805.3999999999996s)]
*  like three billion sperms a day or something crazy. [[01:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=3810.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=3813.24s)]
*  Which means that his body was either not making them, he had a broken body, [[01:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=3813.64s)]
*  or he was making those things and they were having to go somewhere. [[01:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=3817.32s)]
*  Yep. [[01:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=3820.84s)]
*  Would you poop them out? [[01:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=3821.48s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=3823.2400000000002s)]
*  Would they go into your other parts of your body? [[01:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=3823.56s)]
*  If you have that much, I'm sure some of it has to get back there. [[01:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=3825.6400000000003s)]
*  You can't pee it out because that's coming. [[01:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=3829.1600000000003s)]
*  That's ejaculating. [[01:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=3832.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=3833.4s)]
*  That's cheating. [[01:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=3833.8s)]
*  So where was it going? Do you feel like you know where it went, Riley? [[01:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=3834.76s)]
*  Could you feel a certain part of your body felt different other than your genitals after you came? [[01:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=3837.8s)]
*  Yeah, like did you ever wake up in the morning and it felt like you'd already eaten or whatever? [[01:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=3843.0800000000004s)]
*  Just like, did you ever wake up in the morning and feel full for no reason? [[01:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=3848.28s)]
*  No. [[01:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=3853.7200000000003s)]
*  Dude, here's a similar fact. I saw this. [[01:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=3855.0800000000004s)]
*  I saw that if you hold in a poop for too long, a fart, that it will come out your mouth. [[01:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=3859.0s)]
*  Really? [[01:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=3864.92s)]
*  If you hold it in for too long, it will come out of your mouth. [[01:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=3865.48s)]
*  Oh my God, girl. Well, I've always heard that a poop is just a gay belch. [[01:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=3868.76s)]
*  I've always heard that. [[01:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=3874.1200000000003s)]
*  I mean, kind of. [[01:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=3876.44s)]
*  Oh, a fart is just a gay belch. [[01:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=3877.4s)]
*  Dude, imagine. I don't even want to talk about it. That's gross. [[01:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=3879.32s)]
*  But a lot of dudes save them like that. They know they're going to belch or whatever, [[01:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=3882.36s)]
*  but they've been married for a long time. They're like, [[01:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=3885.32s)]
*  swallow that one and hit her with it later. [[01:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=3888.12s)]
*  I'm going to toss that one into that while she's dreaming at night. [[01:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=3892.52s)]
*  Gross. [[01:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=3895.4s)]
*  A lot of guys are like that. Guys are sick, man. [[01:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=3895.96s)]
*  Guys are sick. I have, well, I won't say. I'm going to speak for myself. Guys are sick, though. [[01:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=3898.12s)]
*  I have never. [[01:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=3902.76s)]
*  Not me. [[01:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=3903.2400000000002s)]
*  What'd you say? [[01:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=3903.72s)]
*  Not me. [[01:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=3905.48s)]
*  But guys disgust me. [[01:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=3909.24s)]
*  Oh, they are. [[01:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=3910.52s)]
*  Men are disgusting. [[01:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=3911.56s)]
*  They are disgusting. [[01:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=3912.68s)]
*  Except for Glooney Balls, too. Not him. [[01:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=3913.64s)]
*  Oh no, he's so sweet. [[01:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=3915.64s)]
*  He's such a king. [[01:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=3916.9199999999996s)]
*  I miss him. And he was in love with a girl from here. They still in love? [[01:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=3918.6s)]
*  I don't know if we're allowed to talk about it, but he is a heartthrob. [[01:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=3922.68s)]
*  Women are drawn to him. Men want to be like him. [[01:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=3927.48s)]
*  Me and him went on a double date last year. [[01:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=3931.3199999999997s)]
*  Really? [[01:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=3933.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=3933.8s)]
*  Where? [[01:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=3934.36s)]
*  Up in Wisconsin. [[01:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=3935.6400000000003s)]
*  No way. [[01:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=3937.88s)]
*  We took, it's like a little, had a little camping thing with some girls one weekend. [[01:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=3939.0s)]
*  Wait, was I there? [[01:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=3944.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=3945.96s)]
*  Was I your date? Did you have a girl there or was I your date? [[01:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=3947.7200000000003s)]
*  No, I had a girl there. [[01:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=3950.36s)]
*  Wait, can we talk about this? I want to talk about two things, actually. [[01:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=3951.2400000000002s)]
*  First of all, I want to talk about how you took me to your friend's wedding as your plus one. [[01:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=3955.4s)]
*  Yeah, thank you for coming, dude. [[01:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=3959.8s)]
*  And you didn't tell them I was coming. [[01:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=3961.0800000000004s)]
*  Yes. [[01:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=3963.0s)]
*  So I showed up, it's a small wedding, and then they didn't know I was coming. [[01:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=3963.96s)]
*  And I didn't know any of the people there. [[01:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=3967.96s)]
*  And they had you sitting at the front table and they just didn't have a place for me. [[01:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=3969.56s)]
*  So I had to sit in the back with people I had never met in my life. [[01:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=3974.6800000000003s)]
*  Oh, dude. And they put you next to the drunkest people that have ever graced, [[01:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=3978.28s)]
*  it was me and my buddy Scott, it was his wedding. [[01:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=3984.04s)]
*  They put you next to the drunkest people that ever graced the world. [[01:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=3986.52s)]
*  And somebody broke that toilet, remember? [[01:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=3989.7200000000003s)]
*  Yeah, somebody did. Dude, I went to the bathroom. [[01:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=3991.8s)]
*  We're in Spain. [[01:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=3995.0s)]
*  We're in Portugal. [[01:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=3996.76s)]
*  That's true. We were in Portugal, in Sintra, that's what I was thinking. [[01:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=3997.6400000000003s)]
*  And we went to this old house, it was a beautiful wedding. [[01:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=4001.96s)]
*  And I sat on this toilet trying to probably just get somewhere to have some quiet time. [[01:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=4004.92s)]
*  Yeah, to poop or whatever they call it over there. [[01:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=4009.88s)]
*  And the toilet fell off the wall. [[01:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=4011.7200000000003s)]
*  Why was it on the wall? [[01:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=4014.76s)]
*  I think they, oh, everything's more artistic there, you know what I'm saying? [[01:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=4016.1200000000003s)]
*  They don't want you to just, you know, I think, and they recycle. [[01:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=4020.12s)]
*  I don't know why. [[01:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=4023.48s)]
*  Bro, the toilet was on the ground. [[01:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=4023.96s)]
*  I think I have a picture of it you can put on this. [[01:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=4025.96s)]
*  Okay. Well, I remember next thing you, everybody's at the wedding. [[01:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=4027.7999999999997s)]
*  It was a long wedding because a couple of people got up there and were kind of chatty, [[01:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=4031.24s)]
*  whatever, making it about them, right? [[01:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=4034.2s)]
*  A couple people have been rubbing dirty baby oil on their legs. [[01:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=4037.3199999999997s)]
*  And fucking could barely even speak, right? [[01:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=4041.7999999999997s)]
*  So we're up there and you heard like a crack and then you heard somebody scream [[01:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=4044.44s)]
*  out of this balcony window that was directly above the wedding. [[01:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=4050.36s)]
*  I mean, it was like 22 feet from the closest patron at the wedding. [[01:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=4053.8s)]
*  What the hell was that? [[01:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=4059.08s)]
*  Dude. Oh my God. [[01:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=4061.88s)]
*  That was, yeah, I said that was, that was. [[01:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=4062.92s)]
*  And then people, this is the worst part. [[01:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=4072.04s)]
*  They had a winding stone staircase. [[01:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=4073.8s)]
*  People had to go up there to use it. [[01:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=4075.32s)]
*  It's at restroom. [[01:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=4076.28s)]
*  But when they got up there, there's a broken toilet laying there. [[01:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=4076.92s)]
*  It was the only toilet. [[01:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=4079.8s)]
*  Yeah, that was fun. [[01:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=4081.48s)]
*  And the other thing I want to talk to you about is, dude, you got to stop sending. [[01:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=4082.92s)]
*  I don't know if you're doing it as a joke or you're trying to be nice. [[01:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=4087.0s)]
*  Stop sending me your old clothes. [[01:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=4089.48s)]
*  I'll get a package from you. [[01:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=4093.5600000000004s)]
*  And every time it's just some old shirts you don't want anymore. [[01:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=4095.32s)]
*  I can tell that they're like your bad shirt. [[01:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=4098.84s)]
*  You bought me one nice shirt and the rest of our just your shitty old shirt. [[01:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=4103.8s)]
*  That is not true. [[01:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=4110.04s)]
*  There's some, there are some hitters in there. [[01:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=4111.4800000000005s)]
*  Did you go through all of them? [[01:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=4118.04s)]
*  You got me one nice shirt, a red shirt that says hot sauce on it. [[01:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=4119.4800000000005s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=4122.52s)]
*  That is my best shirt for you. [[01:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=4122.76s)]
*  It's a great shirt. [[01:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=4124.12s)]
*  There are some other real. [[01:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=4125.0s)]
*  And they're larges. [[01:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=4127.16s)]
*  I can't even. [[01:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=4127.88s)]
*  You just, I just picture you being like, get rid of that. [[01:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=4130.92s)]
*  And you're someone be like, you want to throw them away? [[01:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=4134.280000000001s)]
*  Like, nah, send them to Caleb. [[01:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=4136.360000000001s)]
*  Send them to Caleb's house so he can throw them away. [[01:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=4138.280000000001s)]
*  Oh, baby bear don't want that nightie. [[01:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=4139.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=4142.6s)]
*  Dude, I think, but here's the thing. [[01:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=4146.6s)]
*  Would you let, oh wait, Riley Mao, what happened to you? [[01:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=4148.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=4152.360000000001s)]
*  Tell us, tell them what happened real quick so we don't forget. [[01:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=4152.860000000001s)]
*  Um, yeah, no, I, I mean, everything was, uh, everything came out great. [[01:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=4156.4400000000005s)]
*  But what happened? [[01:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=4164.04s)]
*  How much give us a, uh, like, did you get a, like, if you had a guess, [[01:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=4164.76s)]
*  just even in handfuls, how much you, like, what are we talking about there? [[01:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=4170.6s)]
*  Like in a child, not a child's handful, but like a adult handful. [[01:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=4175.88s)]
*  Sorry, dude. [[01:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=4180.6s)]
*  Like a, just fucking tell us, dude, probably two or three. [[01:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=4181.16s)]
*  Oh my God. [[01:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=4184.84s)]
*  No, two or three. [[01:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=4187.320000000001s)]
*  Ooh. [[01:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=4194.360000000001s)]
*  Bro. [[01:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=4199.96s)]
*  God. [[01:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=4201.56s)]
*  Well, you must've been dehydrated to your throat close up. [[01:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=4203.16s)]
*  It sounds like, oh my God, you might've needed an arcane after that. [[01:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=4206.2s)]
*  I mean, that's a, Ooh, that's a war. [[01:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=4210.68s)]
*  Ooh, that's a big dose, boy. [[01:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=4212.84s)]
*  God. [[01:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=4215.320000000001s)]
*  What do you do with that? [[01:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=4216.68s)]
*  That is, uh, hmm. [[01:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=4217.88s)]
*  And so, Riley, I guess the last question is just the first one I asked is, [[01:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=4220.76s)]
*  have you been doing it more and more? [[01:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=4225.320000000001s)]
*  Or yeah, I have. [[01:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=4226.68s)]
*  You're addicted to it? [[01:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=4227.88s)]
*  Not addicted. [[01:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=4229.72s)]
*  Are you a sex addict? [[01:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=4230.6s)]
*  No. [[01:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=4232.280000000001s)]
*  How many times do you feel like you've had sex since that happened, Riley? [[01:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=4232.68s)]
*  Cause it's been about eight months now, almost one year, isn't it? [[01:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=4234.92s)]
*  Yeah, about, um, I would say, [[01:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=4238.360000000001s)]
*  I don't know, a couple of times, few times a week. [[01:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=4243.8s)]
*  Okay. [[01:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=4247.0s)]
*  Good God, bro. [[01:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=4248.84s)]
*  Slow down. [[01:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=4250.04s)]
*  You think you have any kids or do you think that is that something you're interested in doing? [[01:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=4250.84s)]
*  Eventually. [[01:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=4255.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=4255.56s)]
*  And what about your walk with God? [[01:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=4256.120000000001s)]
*  I know you were saving yourself for marriage, right? [[01:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=4257.4800000000005s)]
*  Right. [[01:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=4260.280000000001s)]
*  And that went by the wayside. [[01:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=4260.6s)]
*  You fucked that up. [[01:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=4264.84s)]
*  Oh, that's like kicking over the only shit around. [[01:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=4266.280000000001s)]
*  But anyway, man, sorry, we're putting you on the grill there. [[01:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=4272.76s)]
*  Sorry, bro. [[01:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=4274.76s)]
*  Do you feel like you're gaining traction in the sexual community or whatever? [[01:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=4275.4800000000005s)]
*  That you're getting better at or whatever? [[01:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=4279.48s)]
*  Yeah, I think so. [[01:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=4282.12s)]
*  Oh, that's good, man. [[01:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=4282.84s)]
*  Wow. [[01:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=4283.96s)]
*  Do you feel any different? [[01:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=4285.08s)]
*  You know, do you remember if you felt any different after the first time you had sex, Caleb? [[01:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=4286.36s)]
*  I can't remember. [[01:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=4289.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=4292.04s)]
*  I can't remember. [[01:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=4292.68s)]
*  Dude, know what I always think about is how when I was growing up, [[01:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=4294.28s)]
*  you kind of have like people who maybe from your high school or whatever, [[01:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=4298.44s)]
*  just people you're growing up with in your town who get pregnant in high school or like, [[01:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=4301.88s)]
*  and then at the time I would look at them, I looked at them like, [[01:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=4307.96s)]
*  now they're bad people, but like, wow, what idiots. [[01:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=4310.76s)]
*  Yes. [[01:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=4313.96s)]
*  You know, which obviously they probably wish they didn't, but [[01:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=4314.5199999999995s)]
*  all they did was do the same thing every single other person's doing. [[01:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=4317.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=4323.16s)]
*  Every single person's doing that. [[01:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=4323.88s)]
*  And then all that happens is one of them gets unlucky and then you're like, idiot. [[01:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=4326.5199999999995s)]
*  That's how I was. [[01:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=4331.4s)]
*  I've changed my stance on that. [[01:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=4332.2s)]
*  Well, they kind of get unlucky. [[01:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=4334.04s)]
*  It's almost like, you know, when they say if you shake a soda up and everything, [[01:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=4335.16s)]
*  don't open it for a little while, right? [[01:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=4338.5199999999995s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=4340.12s)]
*  And then one guy, right, who's like, I'm gonna open it. [[01:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=4340.76s)]
*  You know what's going to happen if you open it, right? [[01:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=4347.639999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=4350.12s)]
*  And he still opens it. [[01:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=4350.599999999999s)]
*  It does feel like those are the people a lot of the times who do have high school children, but. [[01:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=4351.5599999999995s)]
*  I wonder if I had me a little child where I would keep, [[01:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=4358.5199999999995s)]
*  what I would do with it or wherever I would let it be outside or inside, [[01:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=4360.76s)]
*  probably outside more. [[01:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=4363.639999999999s)]
*  I cannot wait till you have a kid. [[01:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=4364.68s)]
*  I can't wait to meet him. [[01:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=4367.0s)]
*  It has to be. [[01:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=4368.4400000000005s)]
*  Be cool, huh? [[01:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=4370.280000000001s)]
*  That would be cool. [[01:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=4371.08s)]
*  Riley, are you guys thinking about, because you have a girlfriend now, Riley? [[01:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=4372.200000000001s)]
*  I do. [[01:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=4375.0s)]
*  Okay. [[01:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=4375.4800000000005s)]

*  Have you guys started talking about it? [[01:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=4377.240000000001s)]
*  Eventually, yeah. [[01:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=4379.4800000000005s)]
*  Wow. [[01:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=4381.0s)]
*  Do you miss the days when you hadn't been, I don't even want to say, but we hadn't been [[01:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=4384.200000000001s)]
*  just bursting out out there. [[01:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=4391.0s)]
*  Just spackling that, that, uh, [[01:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=4393.08s)]

*  Dave Portnoy has a good theory on this. [[01:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=4612.92s)]
*  Dave's theory is that he has no idea what's going on, like in terms of how we're all perceiving [[01:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=4615.56s)]
*  this and like social media about it. [[01:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=4619.24s)]
*  He's like his theory is that Dave, Bill O'Tex is not on his phone and just doesn't have any [[01:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=4621.0s)]
*  clue what's happening. [[01:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=4625.56s)]

*  So he's just enjoying his life. [[01:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=4626.84s)]
*  He's just like going about his life, loving his life because I think she probably posts [[01:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=4627.8s)]
*  all his social media and stuff for him. [[01:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=4631.4800000000005s)]
*  And so of course she's going to post pictures of only her. [[01:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=4632.76s)]
*  Yeah, I would too. [[01:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=4635.16s)]
*  Yeah, dude, well, my parents were 38 years different, so I got to be honest with you. [[01:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=4636.36s)]
*  My parents were 38 years different, so I got to be like, love is, you know, if you find [[01:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=4641.08s)]

*  Yeah, totally. [[01:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=4650.28s)]
*  I mean, this is, this is a huge difference. [[01:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=4650.76s)]
*  I don't know how many years difference is it? [[01:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=4652.92s)]
*  I also changed my probably 50 years, bro. [[01:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=4654.28s)]
*  No, Raleigh Mao. [[01:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=4657.16s)]
*  24 and 74, I believe that's 50. [[01:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=4658.28s)]
*  No, bro, that is 50, man. [[01:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=4661.88s)]
*  I just crunched the numbers. [[01:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=4663.88s)]
*  I don't know if those are the actual ages, but that is 50. [[01:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=4664.92s)]
*  What do you say to people who say that's 50, dude? [[01:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=4667.32s)]
*  But I, the only thing is I change my opinions a lot. [[01:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=4669.96s)]
*  So this could be outdated. [[01:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=4672.6s)]
*  Like I'll change my opinion on this tomorrow. [[01:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=4673.72s)]
*  Dude, all I'm saying is the portal is open for old men and young women. [[01:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=4675.72s)]
*  This is the, I mean, the portal is open now. [[01:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=4679.24s)]
*  And it's probably easier than ever to meet them. [[01:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=4683.56s)]
*  There's probably, there's so many apps and stuff where you can, and I don't, [[01:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=4686.84s)]
*  and girls seem to be really attracted to guys who have money and guys who are successful, [[01:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=4690.68s)]
*  and they don't seem to care about looks. [[01:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=4696.04s)]
*  And it doesn't seem like they care about age as much. [[01:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=4697.4s)]
*  Is that true? [[01:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=4699.64s)]
*  Is that crazy to say? [[01:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=4700.280000000001s)]

*  You just collected heat. [[01:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=5027.18s)]
*  You're a damn solar panel at that point. [[01:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=5029.9s)]
*  That's what he's saying, bro. [[01:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=5033.66s)]
*  That is what he's saying. [[01:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=5035.5s)]
*  I didn't realize that. [[01:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=5036.62s)]
*  He's over there charging his phone. [[01:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=5037.66s)]
*  He just got it in his hand. [[01:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=5039.34s)]
*  10%. [[01:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=5042.22s)]
*  11%. [[01:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=5042.86s)]
*  Dude, can you find a video of this guy speaking, Raleigh? [[01:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=5045.58s)]
*  He only lived until 85, which is a good number. [[01:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=5051.5s)]
*  It's a good life. [[01:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=5053.82s)]
*  He put up a good game, but that's not, it's not a hundred. [[01:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=5054.62s)]
*  That's true. [[01:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=5058.94s)]
*  How long do you want to live for? [[01:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=5060.38s)]
*  But living is going to start to get different. [[01:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=5061.66s)]
*  I want to, I want to, I want to go over a couple of things with you. [[01:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=5063.1s)]
*  First of all, and shout out also Winnipeg Jets today, dude. [[01:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=5064.86s)]
*  Did you see their win the other night? [[01:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=5067.58s)]
*  Bro, it's hockey, right? [[01:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=5070.94s)]
*  Okay. [[01:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=5073.34s)]
*  And I met this player. [[01:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=5074.54s)]
*  I met this guy in a bath house or whatever, like a, I don't even remember where it was. [[01:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=5075.9800000000005s)]
*  Vancouver somewhere. [[01:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=5082.46s)]
*  He's putting lip balm on. [[01:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=5084.14s)]
*  I walk in a sauna or whatever. [[01:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=5085.34s)]
*  He's sitting there by himself putting on lip balm. [[01:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=5086.46s)]
*  Where's this going? [[01:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=5088.06s)]
*  Do you have my interest? [[01:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=5091.74s)]
*  I didn't judge him. [[01:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=5092.7s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[01:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=5093.5s)]
*  I was like, you know, it's the, the saunas can be dehydrating. [[01:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=5094.780000000001s)]
*  So anyway, the game, they're down. [[01:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=5101.02s)]
*  Three to one with a minute and seven seconds left. [[01:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=5103.34s)]
*  They score. [[01:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=5106.22s)]
*  Okay. [[01:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=5107.900000000001s)]
*  Two, two, three. [[01:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=5108.46s)]
*  Yep. [[01:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=5109.660000000001s)]
*  Then with 1.7 seconds, the series is tied three, three game seven with 1.7 seconds. [[01:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=5110.700000000001s)]
*  They score again. [[01:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=5116.9400000000005s)]
*  Take it to overtime in the second overtime. [[01:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=5118.22s)]
*  They win the game. [[01:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=5120.06s)]
*  No way. [[01:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=5121.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=5121.660000000001s)]
*  Pretty unbelievable. [[01:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=5121.900000000001s)]
*  Is that your team now? [[01:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=5122.54s)]
*  Wait, what were you going to tell me? [[01:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=5123.660000000001s)]
*  That has nothing to do with what you said. [[01:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=5124.54s)]
*  Oh, how long do you want to live? [[01:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=5126.9400000000005s)]
*  No, you said I'm going to tell you a few things. [[01:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=5128.22s)]
*  Listen up. [[01:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=5130.06s)]
*  This is what I'm going to tell you. [[01:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=5130.620000000001s)]
*  So first of all, they have different skin now. [[01:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=5131.9800000000005s)]
*  Right? [[01:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=5134.22s)]
*  I believe that there's in the future, this is our, I believe one of the last five years [[01:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=5134.46s)]
*  will be wearing this skin. [[01:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=5138.7s)]
*  I believe they're going to come out with a material, right? [[01:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=5140.22s)]
*  That will completely cover our skin. [[01:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=5146.54s)]
*  So it'll both preserve your skin, also allow your skin to breathe, all the things that [[01:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=5148.7s)]
*  it needs to do still with nature, but that it will become a new layer, right? [[01:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=5152.78s)]
*  That you will probably will cover most of your body. [[01:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=5157.9s)]
*  Right. [[01:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=5160.54s)]
*  That will preserve your skin. [[01:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=5160.86s)]
*  So I believe that you'll start to see that. [[01:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=5162.62s)]
*  So people will be able to technically look younger for longer. [[01:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=5165.66s)]
*  Right. [[01:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=5169.58s)]
*  But you'll never know because you won't see them. [[01:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=5169.82s)]
*  You'll never know because you won't really see them. [[01:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=5171.98s)]
*  You can't see their skin, but under there, it does look better, but you just can't see it. [[01:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=5173.339999999999s)]
*  Right. [[01:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=5176.46s)]
*  You just can't see it. [[01:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=5176.62s)]
*  And they'll just be like, hey, I look great. [[01:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=5177.179999999999s)]
*  And then people will also be able to program based on that outer layer, what they want [[01:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=5180.219999999999s)]
*  you to see them wear, right? [[01:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=5184.46s)]
*  So at a certain point, I don't know how we'll do it, but we'll start to have like [[01:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=5185.74s)]
*  glasses or contacts that will. [[01:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=5191.02s)]
*  So I can make everybody look like they're wearing the 1900s today or something like that. [[01:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=5194.620000000001s)]
*  Who decides? [[01:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=5198.860000000001s)]
*  You decide what you want to look like or I can decide what you look like? [[01:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=5199.660000000001s)]
*  I think you get to decide the operator. [[01:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=5202.780000000001s)]
*  Naked. [[01:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=5204.780000000001s)]
*  You could. [[01:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=5205.900000000001s)]
*  I guess you're naked, but it's not. [[01:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=5206.38s)]
*  I would do not you naked. [[01:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=5207.900000000001s)]
*  Thank you. [[01:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=5210.06s)]
*  I would go, yeah, or somebody you could do like everybody's eating ice cream, [[01:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=5211.1s)]
*  like glenny balls today. [[01:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=5215.580000000001s)]
*  Okay. [[01:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=5216.46s)]
*  So you could get to pick. [[01:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=5217.02s)]
*  Day by day. [[01:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=5218.06s)]
*  Based on your eyes, everybody who has that skin, you could adjust it because it'll be [[01:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=5218.7s)]
*  able to adjust it. [[01:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=5222.86s)]
*  Does that make sense? [[01:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=5223.5s)]
*  It's the worst episode of my life. [[01:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=5226.38s)]
*  Don't say that. [[01:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=5227.9s)]
*  Sorry. [[01:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=5228.46s)]
*  I'm sorry. [[01:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=5228.78s)]
*  I'm breaking your heart, man. [[01:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=5229.26s)]
*  I'm sorry, dude. [[01:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=5230.46s)]
*  Don't say that kind of stuff. [[01:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=5232.139999999999s)]
*  I just feel like I let you down today, man. [[01:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=5233.099999999999s)]
*  Man, I don't think you did at all. [[01:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=5234.62s)]
*  I think it's a really good episode. [[01:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=5237.34s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=5239.34s)]
*  I think you're going to have to cut out a lot. [[01:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=5239.5s)]
*  I'll say this. [[01:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=5242.38s)]
*  I'm excited about the Indiana, Indiana fever starting back. [[01:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=5242.86s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=5245.34s)]
*  How have you kept up with? [[01:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=5245.58s)]
*  Because we went to the game. [[01:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=5246.54s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=5247.74s)]
*  We went and saw Kayla Clark break the record. [[01:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=5248.06s)]
*  Dude, it was so great. [[01:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=5249.900000000001s)]
*  And then the other day she's back there, shoots a three from further back than the one we [[01:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=5250.700000000001s)]
*  saw her break the record. [[01:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=5255.660000000001s)]
*  And we were right there when she broke the record. [[01:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=5256.46s)]
*  So tough. [[01:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=5258.14s)]
*  Have you been talking to Patrick? [[01:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=5259.1s)]
*  Yeah, Patrick and Connor, dude. [[01:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=5261.18s)]

*  I am a Kayla Clark fan. [[01:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=5297.26s)]
*  Cut that out. [[01:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=5301.5s)]
*  You had to cut that out of your episode. [[01:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=5302.14s)]
*  You died on that one. [[01:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=5304.46s)]
*  Oh, bro, you see Shabuzy at that Met Gala. [[01:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=5305.58s)]
*  What was that? [[01:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=5308.62s)]
*  You look like a pepper. [[01:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=5309.18s)]
*  Shake your. [[01:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=5311.1s)]
*  You look like a pepper shaker. [[01:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=5311.58s)]
*  Wow. [[01:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=5317.18s)]
*  Yeah, that's a wild look, isn't it? [[01:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=5317.5s)]
*  That was it. [[01:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=5319.26s)]
*  It wasn't bad. [[01:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=5319.74s)]
*  Oh, no, I don't think it was bad. [[01:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=5320.54s)]
*  But I do. [[01:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=5321.9s)]
*  Do you think that there is a real truth? [[01:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=5322.54s)]
*  Because in a black culture, they start saying, oh, they dress a lot of black men up like women. [[01:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=5324.22s)]
*  I've heard that. [[01:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=5328.3s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=5329.02s)]
*  That's true. [[01:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=5329.42s)]
*  They've dressed white guys up like women. [[01:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=5329.74s)]
*  Anyone who's trying to they dress those guys are. [[01:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=5331.9s)]
*  Everyone looks like women at the Met Gala. [[01:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=5334.700000000001s)]
*  That's a good point. [[01:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=5336.780000000001s)]
*  Do you think would you go to something like that? [[01:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=5337.42s)]
*  I've always thought about that. [[01:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=5339.26s)]
*  Like not that I would ever. [[01:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=5340.22s)]
*  If you and me went, I would go. [[01:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=5341.34s)]
*  I wouldn't go like with some publicist. [[01:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=5343.42s)]
*  I don't think I would go with something like that. [[01:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=5347.660000000001s)]
*  It's kind of like a weird type of like almost like celebrity worship where it's like too much. [[01:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=5348.620000000001s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=5353.820000000001s)]
*  It kind of weird to me to be honest with you. [[01:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=5354.3s)]
*  Yeah, I don't. [[01:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=5356.620000000001s)]
*  It seems like a seance to me. [[01:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=5357.26s)]
*  It has seance vibes to me a little bit. [[01:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=5358.780000000001s)]
*  And I just wonder like. [[01:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=5361.34s)]
*  Yeah, there's something about it that has seance type of vibes to me or whatever that's called. [[01:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=5363.74s)]
*  Like when you meet in the woods or whatever and do something wild like that. [[01:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=5369.179999999999s)]
*  Oh, dude, I'll tell you this one story. [[01:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=5374.38s)]
*  So we're at we did some shows. [[01:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=5375.5s)]
*  We did like SEC, right? [[01:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=5377.98s)]
*  Some different places. [[01:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=5379.9s)]
*  We're at University of Arkansas. [[01:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=5381.0199999999995s)]
*  Yep. [[01:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=5383.98s)]
*  And Sam Pitt. [[01:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=5384.86s)]
*  We're leaving the gym, right? [[01:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=5385.66s)]
*  We get to use their gym. [[01:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=5386.7s)]
*  I know Coach Pittman. [[01:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=5387.58s)]
*  He was at Carolina when I was there. [[01:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=5388.3s)]
*  No way. [[01:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=5389.5s)]
*  Dude, he's awesome. [[01:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=5390.219999999999s)]
*  Right. [[01:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=5391.42s)]
*  So we're leaving the gym and it's me and Amir K, this comedian that works with me on the road. [[01:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=5391.66s)]
*  And dude, so we're leaving and we see this guy pull up in this car and it's Coach Pittman. [[01:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=5397.74s)]
*  And he comes over. [[01:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=5403.66s)]

*  Starts talking to us. [[01:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=5406.22s)]
*  He's like, man, tell me about Bobby. [[01:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=5407.26s)]
*  And so I'm thinking to sing about Bobby Kennedy Jr. [[01:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=5410.46s)]
*  Right. [[01:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=5412.62s)]
*  So we start talking about Bobby Kennedy for like two, two minutes. [[01:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=5413.34s)]
*  Amir is doing like an in-person. [[01:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=5416.54s)]
*  He's doing impersonation, everything. [[01:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=5422.06s)]
*  And he's, Coach Pittman's like going along with us. [[01:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=5425.1s)]
*  And then he goes, Bobby. [[01:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=5429.26s)]
*  And I'm like, why do you listen to us for two minutes? [[01:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=5440.3s)]
*  Do horrible impersonations of R.F.K. [[01:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=5444.62s)]
*  Jr. [[01:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=5447.18s)]
*  Just so he can go, Bobby. [[01:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=5448.7s)]
*  Did you get to hang out with Coach Pittman? [[01:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=5450.22s)]
*  He is funny. [[01:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=5452.38s)]
*  Dude, he talked to us for like 20 minutes. [[01:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=5453.42s)]
*  It was one of the highlights of our trip. [[01:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=5454.780000000001s)]
*  That and the Alabama players were so cool, man. [[01:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=5456.62s)]
*  We went there, just took us around their facility and stuff. [[01:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=5459.66s)]
*  Really? [[01:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=5462.54s)]
*  They were super nice. [[01:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=5463.02s)]
*  Every place was cool, but they like, they just went out of their way. [[01:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=5463.900000000001s)]
*  You know, like some of their best players, a lot of times the guys are too cool to do [[01:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=5467.02s)]
*  that type of shit. [[01:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=5470.3s)]
*  But it was great, man. [[01:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=5471.58s)]
*  Did you get to talk to the new coach? [[01:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=5472.780000000001s)]
*  Alabama? [[01:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=5475.42s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=5475.900000000001s)]
*  No, we did not get to meet him. [[01:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=5476.22s)]
*  So I wish we would have, but it was great though, just to get to go to some of the [[01:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=5477.26s)]
*  SEC places. [[01:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=5482.22s)]
*  And like you said earlier, it's like they mean it at these, it's like part of the deal. [[01:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=5483.1s)]
*  Alabama. [[01:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=5487.58s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=5488.7s)]
*  And that campus is nice. [[01:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=5489.74s)]
*  It's the nicest campus. [[01:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=5491.5s)]
*  They said it's gotten way nicer because of the victories that they had. [[01:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=5492.38s)]
*  100%. [[01:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=5495.02s)]
*  Through the same years. [[01:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=5495.58s)]
*  100%. [[01:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=5496.46s)]
*  I think it's harder to get into Alabama now because of football being good. [[01:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=5497.26s)]
*  Because they have more people who want to go so they can be, they can have like smart [[01:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=5500.62s)]
*  people down in Alabama now. [[01:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=5503.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=5504.7s)]
*  Not that they weren't. [[01:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=5505.26s)]
*  No. [[01:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=5506.22s)]
*  But they weren't. [[01:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=5506.46s)]
*  Back in the day. [[01:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=5508.06s)]
*  They have an Appalachian State too, but where I'm from. [[01:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=5508.78s)]
*  Appalachian State won like three national championships in a row. [[01:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=5511.02s)]
*  And then they had so many more applicants after they beat Michigan. [[01:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=5513.9s)]
*  That school went from kind of like just so anyone could kind of get into it, like a [[01:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=5517.5s)]
*  competitive school. [[01:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=5520.62s)]
*  Like quadrupled their people who tried to go to App State. [[01:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=5521.82s)]
*  It's like a nice school now. [[01:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=5526.78s)]
*  But that Tuscaloosa has the best setup of any, because I did that tour. [[01:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=5527.9800000000005s)]
*  When I first graduated college, the first thing I did was like two years on the road [[01:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=5532.38s)]
*  living in a bus. [[01:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=5536.46s)]
*  Going to colleges. [[01:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=5537.58s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=5539.26s)]
*  And just, we just went to every college and just partied. [[01:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=5539.74s)]
*  That was my job for like two years. [[01:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=5542.22s)]
*  And Tuscaloosa is the nicest one. [[01:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=5544.06s)]
*  They got that perfect setup. [[01:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=5546.54s)]
*  Right. [[01:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=5547.900000000001s)]
*  They got the stadium. [[01:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=5548.14s)]
*  Oh dude, we got to go out on the field. [[01:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=5549.18s)]
*  No way. [[01:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=5551.26s)]
*  We got to run out on the field, man. [[01:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=5552.06s)]
*  Yeah, it was crazy. [[01:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=5553.900000000001s)]
*  You're kind of one of those guys who switch up. [[01:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=5555.1s)]
*  Like you'll be, you were supposed to be a Tennessee fan, but I don't have a lot of [[01:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=5556.54s)]
*  faith in you at all. [[01:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=5560.38s)]
*  Well, remember we went back there and they didn't really welcome us back. [[01:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=5561.820000000001s)]
*  It felt like you remember. [[01:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=5566.06s)]
*  No, because we couldn't find the field. [[01:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=5567.02s)]
*  That was not because they weren't welcoming us. [[01:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=5568.700000000001s)]
*  We got lost. [[01:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=5570.06s)]
*  We got lost for about 45 minutes trying to find the field. [[01:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=5571.9800000000005s)]
*  I think I've just, I realize I'm an SEC, I'm just, I am an SEC guy, man. [[01:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=5574.620000000001s)]

*  It's not even close. [[01:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=5581.02s)]
*  The rest of it should just, what are they doing in? [[01:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=5582.780000000001s)]
*  It's not even close. [[01:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=5585.1s)]
*  ACC basketball is awesome, but SEC basketball is awesome now. [[01:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=5585.900000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=5589.02s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=5590.160000000001s)]
*  My favorite sport was always LSU basketball. [[01:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=5590.4800000000005s)]
*  But yeah, I think, you know, it's like, I'm a Winnipeg Jets fan. [[01:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=5595.120000000001s)]
*  What happened? [[01:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=5600.56s)]
*  I mean, SEC is so good. [[01:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=5601.120000000001s)]
*  It's like, you just, I don't know. [[01:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=5602.160000000001s)]
*  You start to love it all. [[01:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=5603.84s)]
*  I think they only have like 13 sports where like Carolina, we had like 33 sports. [[01:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=5604.8s)]
*  And so they just dump all that money because only sports that make any money are men's [[01:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=5610.64s)]
*  basketball and football. [[01:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=5615.280000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=5616.320000000001s)]
*  All the rest of the sports lose money. [[01:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=5616.72s)]
*  And so if they only have 13 sports, they can take all that money and just dump them [[01:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=5618.72s)]
*  right back into the good ones. [[01:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=5623.12s)]
*  Whereas you got to spread it all out at like Stanford has like 33 sports. [[01:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=5625.4400000000005s)]

*  Yeah. [[01:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=5632.320000000001s)]
*  Transing. [[01:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=5633.84s)]
*  Transing is a sport. [[01:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=5638.08s)]
*  Things have changed, man. [[01:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=5640.96s)]
*  No, but there's nothing better than being like just loving the SEC, man. [[01:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=5643.52s)]
*  And living in Nashville is so great because it's easy to get to a lot of the schools, man. [[01:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=5646.4s)]
*  It really is. [[01:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=5650.0s)]
*  It's like, it's just a little bit easier. [[01:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=5650.48s)]
*  So like, that's been great, dude. [[01:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=5652.08s)]

*  Everything's been good, dude. [[01:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=5655.679999999999s)]
*  We got to go see an Indiana Fever game though. [[01:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=5656.48s)]
*  That would be really fun. [[01:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=5658.08s)]
*  They got a bunch of new players too. [[01:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=5658.639999999999s)]

*  If you like that. [[01:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=5675.5199999999995s)]
*  I don't know if that's just the only time they publicize that they're playing, [[01:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=5677.76s)]
*  but they play every time I look, it's Angel, Reese, and Kailyn Clark. [[01:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0Gv0GOSoI&t=5681.04s)]
