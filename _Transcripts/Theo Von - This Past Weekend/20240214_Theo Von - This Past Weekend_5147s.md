*  You are almost mentally handicapped. Isn't that crazy? [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2y6tUjt6L8&t=1070.32s)]

*  At a certain point everybody's mind goes on [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2y6tUjt6L8&t=1882.8s)]
*  Sometimes your mind goes to heaven before you do people you see people wandering around their minds been in heaven their minds [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2y6tUjt6L8&t=1887.2s)]

*  It's getting to the point with biden where he's basically a scarecrow [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2y6tUjt6L8&t=1920.96s)]
*  That has a popular job [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2y6tUjt6L8&t=1926.96s)]

*  Yeah, I think love gets [[01:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2y6tUjt6L8&t=3798.24s)]
*  I think love is something that we all need [[01:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2y6tUjt6L8&t=3801.6s)]
*  You know, you see what happens to a child that doesn't have any love, you know [[01:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2y6tUjt6L8&t=3807.7599999999998s)]
*  You see what happens to animals that don't have any love and [[01:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2y6tUjt6L8&t=3812.56s)]
*  You know, it's obvious [[01:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2y6tUjt6L8&t=3818.96s)]
*  It's obvious that we need it [[01:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2y6tUjt6L8&t=3821.9199999999996s)]
*  Um [[01:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2y6tUjt6L8&t=3825.12s)]
*  And it's nice to think of that. Yeah, how do I fall in love with somebody else? [[01:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2y6tUjt6L8&t=3827.12s)]
*  How do I get into a relationship with somebody and and have a partner? [[01:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2y6tUjt6L8&t=3831.2799999999997s)]
*  And [[01:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2y6tUjt6L8&t=3840.16s)]
*  Yeah, so much of that is out of our hands, you know, um [[01:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2y6tUjt6L8&t=3842.08s)]
*  I mean some things like you want to give yourself the best chance, you know, I think because you have to meet people [[01:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2y6tUjt6L8&t=3846.64s)]
*  And um, so you have to put yourself out there [[01:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2y6tUjt6L8&t=3853.2s)]
*  You do [[01:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2y6tUjt6L8&t=3856.3199999999997s)]
*  You know, uh, I mean it could you could just meet somebody at a grocery store or something [[01:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2y6tUjt6L8&t=3857.9199999999996s)]
*  But sometimes people meet each other the more people you run into the more chances you're going to have to meet someone so [[01:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2y6tUjt6L8&t=3861.44s)]
*  That just is part of it [[01:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2y6tUjt6L8&t=3867.6s)]
*  And then in the meantime, I think enjoy the peace that you do have with yourself [[01:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2y6tUjt6L8&t=3869.52s)]
*  And start to fall in love with yourself more if you can. I know that may sound strange and i'm not trying to [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2y6tUjt6L8&t=3875.12s)]
*  um [[01:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2y6tUjt6L8&t=3881.3599999999997s)]
*  I'm just thinking out loud [[01:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2y6tUjt6L8&t=3883.2799999999997s)]

*  You know for me I notice sometimes that um [[01:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2y6tUjt6L8&t=3889.2s)]
*  That I don't have the best relationship with myself really I don't really communicate with myself that much I do some [[01:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2y6tUjt6L8&t=3896.8799999999997s)]
*  But really communicate with myself [[01:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2y6tUjt6L8&t=3905.3599999999997s)]
