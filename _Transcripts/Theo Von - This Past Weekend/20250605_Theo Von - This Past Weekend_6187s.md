# Arnold Schwarzenegger | This Past Weekend w/ Theo Von #587
**Theo Von - This Past Weekend:** [June 05, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY)
*  Today's guest is a legendary actor, bodybuilder, taste maker, really in the world of bodybuilding. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=0.0s)]
*  He was the governor of California. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=9.8s)]
*  When you think of the American dream, he is pretty much it. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=11.56s)]
*  The second season of his Netflix show, FUBAR, is dropping soon. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=15.88s)]
*  We're going to talk about that and a lot more. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=21.32s)]
*  I'm honored to sit down with the one and only Mr. Arnold Schwarzenegger. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=23.2s)]
*  So where do you work out of? [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=45.519999999999996s)]
*  I live in Nashville, Tennessee now. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=49.36s)]
*  Tennessee? [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=51.120000000000005s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=51.72s)]
*  I lived here for about 12 years. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=52.04s)]
*  That's a growing city now, isn't it? [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=53.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=55.28s)]
*  It's growing fast because it's safe. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=56.28s)]
*  They have, you can have a weapon if you need to. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=58.0s)]
*  So you can, you know, I think there's that semblance of you can take care of yourself type of energy. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=62.24s)]
*  Right. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=66.56s)]
*  And so, and it's a friendly community and it's very safe. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=67.24s)]
*  You know, it's like a lot of cities, some of them get kind of dangerous. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=70.92s)]
*  It's known for its country music, right? [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=73.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=75.4s)]
*  Do you ever listen to country music growing up? [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=75.96000000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=77.4s)]
*  I mean, that's, we're not growing up. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=77.76s)]
*  Growing up was kind of rock and roll, you know, the fifties rock and roll. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=79.48s)]
*  Did they have any, because you grew up in Austria, right? [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=87.72s)]
*  Or till what age? [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=90.04s)]
*  Austria, yeah. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=90.88000000000001s)]
*  I was in Austria until I was 19. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=91.60000000000001s)]
*  Oh. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=93.56s)]
*  And so we were, there was a program that was called Hit Parade and the Hit Parade. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=93.88000000000001s)]
*  A television show? [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=104.08000000000001s)]
*  No, no. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=105.88000000000001s)]
*  We didn't have television. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=107.16s)]
*  We didn't have television. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=108.8s)]
*  So we just had the radio at home, but I had then bought, I was like 15 and I just [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=110.48s)]
*  bought my first transistor radio in a little plastic box, right? [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=117.4s)]
*  And I paid off like 50 shilling a month until it was paid off a year later. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=123.4s)]
*  But then that always took down to the lake where I grew up. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=132.96s)]
*  Then we were sitting around with the boys from a village and we were [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=136.32s)]
*  listening to this Hit Parade. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=140.88s)]
*  It was from seven to eight at night on Wednesdays. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=142.04s)]
*  And there was like little Richard and Chuck Berry and all of those guys that [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=145.6s)]
*  were, you know, big in the fifties and sixties exactly. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=149.67999999999998s)]
*  And so I grew up with that. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=152.92s)]
*  And that's why I have that station in my radio fifties at all times. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=154.35999999999999s)]
*  Oh, so you still listen to it? [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=159.2s)]
*  It just listens. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=160.35999999999999s)]
*  I just love it. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=161.07999999999998s)]
*  Right. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=162.2s)]
*  Then when I came over here, I became aware of a little bit of the [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=162.92000000000002s)]
*  country, Western kind of music. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=166.8s)]
*  Did you go to a concert in Austria? [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=169.12s)]
*  Was there a concert you ever went to before you came here? [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=170.64000000000001s)]
*  Never before the concert. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=172.48000000000002s)]
*  Are you kidding me? [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=173.56s)]
*  I had no money, but I mean, when I came over here, I then became aware of the [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=174.72s)]
*  country, Western songs, especially Johnny Cash, he'd done a television show, a [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=181.72s)]
*  weekly television show, and it was great, great music. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=187.16000000000003s)]
*  And so I fell in love with that. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=191.6s)]
*  And then friends of mine here in America then took me to concerts. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=194.56s)]
*  You know, it was like a jazz concert or country Western concert and all of this [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=200.04s)]
*  stuff, and just then that's when I started really getting into it, but I mean, I [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=206.0s)]
*  loved the music, but the minute you grow up in Austria, the most of the stuff that [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=210.16s)]
*  you hear is really Austrian music. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=213.35999999999999s)]
*  You know, the umpela, umpela de ley and all this kind of thing. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=216.2s)]
*  Is it beautiful music? [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=219.56s)]
*  Beautiful music, but I mean, that's what you hear on public radio and public [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=220.88s)]
*  television also, that's what you see. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=224.92s)]
*  And you see operas and you hear concerts. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=226.8s)]
*  And then my father himself was a musician. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=232.32s)]
*  He played six instruments. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=235.16s)]
*  Six instruments? [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=237.48s)]
*  Yes. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=238.12s)]
*  Six instruments, all kind of like a fliegelhorn, trumpet, saxophone, clarinet, [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=238.52s)]
*  all of the stuff like that. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=244.64s)]
*  A lot of traditional music he would play. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=246.12s)]
*  Very traditional because he was the conductor of the Chantamourie music, [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=248.07999999999998s)]
*  which is the police, the country police, like the sheriff's. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=253.44s)]
*  Chantamourie it's called? [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=255.72s)]
*  Chantamourie is a French word, a Chandam. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=256.71999999999997s)]
*  And so he was, he was a Chandam. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=260.4s)]
*  He was a police officer. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=264.12s)]
*  And so he played in that Chantamourie music. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=266.12s)]
*  Would he play at home or where would he play? [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=270.92s)]
*  He, he, he practiced at home. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=272.48s)]
*  You know, he would, while I was training, I remember I was doing my [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=275.71999999999997s)]
*  workouts and he would be standing, the window would be opened up at our house [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=279.56s)]
*  and he would be kind of playing out to the window, out the window. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=284.59999999999997s)]
*  And there was a kid, it was my age that lived 150 yards away from us. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=289.4s)]
*  He was one of my best friends. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=297.64s)]
*  And he also learned how to play the trumpet at the age of like 13 or 14. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=299.03999999999996s)]
*  And so he would play over there and then my dad would play over here and they were [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=303.56s)]
*  going back and forth like that. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=308.84s)]
*  So it was really fun. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=310.12s)]
*  Like a couple of birds almost. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=311.36s)]
*  But I never, for some reason or the other, my dad always wanted me to get into music. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=312.56s)]
*  Not as a professional, but I mean- [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=317.64s)]
*  Did you try it at all? [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=319.08s)]
*  Yeah, I tried it. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=320.0s)]
*  It just didn't work. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=321.0s)]
*  What instrument? [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=322.12s)]
*  Well, he tried the trumpet, obviously. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=323.48s)]
*  Then he thought that he can seduce me kind of into the music because I liked Elvis. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=326.32s)]
*  So he said, well, why don't you learn how to play the guitar? [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=332.96s)]
*  I don't play the guitar. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=337.44s)]
*  He says, but there's a farmer that is a hundred yards up the road. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=338.35999999999996s)]
*  He plays the guitar and he can teach. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=342.96s)]
*  He's also a teacher. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=344.79999999999995s)]
*  And so I would go to him, but it just, you know, I just could see right away that [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=346.56s)]
*  that was not meant for me. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=351.32s)]
*  Was there a lot of like when you were a child in Austria, was there a lot of like [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=352.96s)]
*  individualism or were things very like regimented? [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=356.12s)]
*  Like in America, you could like, you can be an individual, right? [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=360.0s)]
*  But some countries it's a little bit harder to kind of like, you know, be an [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=363.32s)]
*  individual and have a voice. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=366.96s)]
*  I'm just wondering what was it like there when you were young? [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=368.12s)]
*  Did it feel like things were regimented or it was okay to be rebellious? [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=370.32s)]
*  What was it like there? [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=374.48s)]
*  Well, I was rebellious in a way because I mean, think about it, soccer and track [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=375.84s)]
*  and field, they were kind of like the in sports, but when I was exposed to [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=382.52s)]
*  weightlifting and to powerlifting and to bodybuilding, I fell in love with that. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=388.24s)]
*  And also because my heroes like Reg Park and Steve Reeves, they were doing [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=395.84000000000003s)]
*  Hercules movies and I just started looking at those movies, right? [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=399.32s)]
*  And so I said, I want to be like that. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=403.72s)]
*  I don't want to be a top soccer player. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=407.24s)]
*  I want to be like that. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=410.16s)]
*  I want to have the muscles like that. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=410.96000000000004s)]
*  And I want to get into movies like that. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=412.68s)]
*  And as a dad always said, it became my dream. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=414.28000000000003s)]
*  So you really want it to be like this. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=417.08000000000004s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=418.84000000000003s)]
*  So I was fixated. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=419.68s)]
*  I was, I was like kind of like concentrating that I kind of put [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=421.56s)]
*  visually my head on Reg Park's body. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=426.76s)]
*  And I said, there was a picture, a famous picture where he won the [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=431.68s)]
*  Mr. Universe contest in London in 1951. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=435.40000000000003s)]
*  And when I saw that picture, it was like him holding the trophy, flexing his bicep. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=440.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=446.52s)]
*  And then I said to myself, can you imagine if this is me? [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=447.15999999999997s)]
*  I'm going to make this me. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=450.64s)]
*  And so that's what I was training for. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=452.59999999999997s)]
*  So my parents thought that it was kind of like, what is that all about? [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=454.08s)]
*  Where did that come from? [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=457.88s)]
*  And the whole neighborhood was kind of like, wondering, what is this guy doing [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=459.44s)]
*  training every day, two hours, three hours a day, I came home and instead of [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=466.23999999999995s)]
*  having lunch, I would put my sit up board up in the kitchen table and I would be [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=470.64s)]
*  doing sit ups, 500 sit ups during lunch. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=476.04s)]
*  So you were addicted to it. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=478.68s)]
*  You were totally addicted. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=479.6s)]
*  Because I was driven by my vision. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=481.12s)]
*  You know, so it was always there. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=483.48s)]
*  Even when I was in school, I would sometimes just wander off and the [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=485.32s)]
*  teacher was teaching out there, writing up something on the blackboard. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=489.44s)]
*  And I would be looking at that. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=493.48s)]
*  And then all of a sudden he could see that I was just kind of like staring off. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=494.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=501.08000000000004s)]
*  And then all of a sudden he threw a chalk at my head and I looked back again. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=501.48s)]
*  He says, he says, Arnold, I'm up here. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=508.64s)]
*  I mean, I know you're looking at the beautiful trees out there. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=512.24s)]
*  They're more beautiful maybe than me, but you got to listen to what I'm saying. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=514.28s)]
*  So, so I noticed I was always kind of drifting off and visualizing, visualizing [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=518.2s)]
*  my dreams, always visualizing my dreams, being on that stage, the Mr. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=524.92s)]
*  Universe contest, doing maybe Hercules movies, going to America and all of that. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=529.12s)]
*  So it was very different. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=534.84s)]
*  So that was not the norm. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=535.6s)]
*  So I did step out of the norm and then, because everyone else was talking about, [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=538.08s)]
*  Oh, I'm going to go and get a job with the government because I want to make sure [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=541.72s)]
*  that I collect my pension when I was 65 and all this, I had no interest in any [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=546.04s)]
*  of that pension. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=551.72s)]
*  I mean, what are we talking about? [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=552.36s)]
*  Now the age of 18, Mr. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=553.24s)]
*  Talking about pensions. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=554.6800000000001s)]
*  I mean, it's crazy, right? [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=555.84s)]
*  But that's the European way. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=557.0s)]
*  Everyone looks for stability or both, especially in those times where government [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=559.04s)]
*  was really ruling, you know, so then that's also, I think an explanation of why [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=563.9599999999999s)]
*  when I came over here to America in 1968 and I saw Hubert Humphrey and Nixon [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=569.8s)]
*  campaigning, he was the vice president under Johnson. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=578.52s)]
*  Okay. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=582.1999999999999s)]
*  And so he was campaigning to become, well, Johnson was after Kennedy. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=582.68s)]
*  Then he was Humphrey was his vice president. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=588.32s)]
*  So he was running for president. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=590.5200000000001s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=592.88s)]
*  And so it was... [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=593.4000000000001s)]
*  Looks like he eats gumdrops, that guy. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=593.84s)]
*  And so it was really interesting when I listened to the debates and I didn't [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=596.08s)]
*  understand maybe three quarter of it, but I had a friend that spoke German and he [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=600.32s)]
*  translated for me. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=607.4000000000001s)]
*  And when I heard of what Nixon said, it was so opposite of what I grew up with, [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=609.0s)]
*  which I didn't like. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=615.7199999999999s)]
*  The government was in kind of in charge of everything. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=617.12s)]
*  In Austria? [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=620.04s)]
*  In Austria, exactly. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=620.64s)]
*  And so I was in Germany and in all those countries over there in Europe, socialism [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=622.3199999999999s)]
*  was the system that I grew up in. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=626.8s)]
*  So when Nixon spoke, I felt like, wow, get government off your back. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=629.1999999999999s)]
*  Get the government off your back. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=637.12s)]
*  That sounds great. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=638.3199999999999s)]
*  Wow. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=639.1999999999999s)]
*  And lowering the taxes, strong military, strong police force, strong [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=639.5999999999999s)]
*  dis-strong gladiator, strong economy. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=647.4799999999999s)]
*  Let the people be free. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=649.76s)]
*  Let them shop all around the world and blah, blah, blah. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=651.28s)]
*  And I said to myself, this is like unbelievable. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=653.92s)]
*  And then when Humphrey spoke, it was like I was back in Austria. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=657.04s)]
*  You know, so then I said to myself, what are the parties here? [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=662.64s)]
*  Because I didn't understand really the parties yet. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=665.68s)]
*  Why? [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=667.5999999999999s)]
*  What was it about Humphrey's that made it feel like you were back in Austria? [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=667.84s)]
*  Well, I said government is the solution. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=670.36s)]
*  Oh, I see. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=672.0400000000001s)]
*  So he was more like the cage. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=673.6800000000001s)]
*  We all know that the government is not the solution. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=675.0400000000001s)]
*  I mean, it's like the free enterprise, the economy and all this. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=677.2800000000001s)]
*  You got to let people be free, not be controlled by government. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=680.9200000000001s)]
*  Government is good, but you have to find kind of the middle ground of all this stuff. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=684.2800000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=688.48s)]
*  You can't, if you rely solely on the government for your life, then you'll just [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=688.5600000000001s)]
*  be a, you'll be a part of the government basically. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=691.48s)]
*  Well, and you become a vegetable. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=693.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=695.12s)]
*  Because you create the safety net and you don't have the will to really [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=695.48s)]
*  kind of make it on your own. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=699.56s)]
*  So what the big advantage of coming to America was that there was no safety net. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=700.8s)]
*  So I was on my own. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=707.4399999999999s)]
*  So I had to get really creative. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=709.6s)]
*  Okay. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=711.3199999999999s)]
*  How can I go and go to school and educate myself? [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=711.4399999999999s)]
*  How can I go and get more English classes? [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=714.52s)]
*  How can I go to Santa Monica City College and at the same time work? [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=717.16s)]
*  And at the same time train five hours a day and do all of those kinds of things. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=721.2s)]
*  So this is, but it was up to me now to be successful, not up to the government. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=726.0s)]
*  Oh, I like that. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=729.96s)]
*  So the government was providing the opportunities and orders, the structure. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=730.64s)]
*  But that is what I enjoyed. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=734.76s)]
*  And so this is why I became kind of like a Nixon Republican. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=736.64s)]
*  And people always were kind of like, you know, especially in California, which is [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=740.24s)]
*  a much more liberal state. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=743.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=744.32s)]
*  So, so I really enjoyed it. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=744.8000000000001s)]
*  Nixon, of course, came from California. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=746.9200000000001s)]
*  Question Arnold. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=749.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=750.12s)]
*  Was it scary to tell your parents that to leave Austria? [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=750.56s)]
*  Did people do that at the time? [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=752.8s)]
*  I'm just a little bit curious on what it was like to say, I'm leaving here and I'm [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=754.12s)]
*  going to go to America was even a popular path for people to go. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=757.88s)]
*  Well, remember, I started saying this when it was 10. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=761.4399999999999s)]
*  Ah, I see. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=764.8399999999999s)]
*  So it had been your parents knew it was in your head. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=765.52s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=767.8399999999999s)]
*  So I saw a documentary, a black and white documentary in the school. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=768.28s)]
*  They showed always those films with this eight millimeter, those whatever [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=771.8s)]
*  films on the little screen. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=777.12s)]
*  And like I said, television was not the common thing at that time in Austria. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=779.36s)]
*  So we didn't grow up with that. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=784.0s)]
*  And, uh, but they showed the film and they saw a documentary about America. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=785.6800000000001s)]
*  Now I see the Empire State Building. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=792.12s)]
*  I said, wait a minute. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=795.96s)]
*  This building is like, you know, a hundred times taller than any of the [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=797.2800000000001s)]
*  buildings in Graz where I grew up, right? [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=801.5600000000001s)]
*  In Austria. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=804.08s)]
*  And, uh, then I saw the Golden Gate Bridge. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=805.16s)]
*  Then I saw the Pacific Coast Highway. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=807.56s)]
*  I saw all of this kind of, you know, great, great things. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=809.4799999999999s)]
*  I saw the six lane highways. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=812.76s)]
*  I saw the big catalogs, you know, with the big Finns sticking out, you know, [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=814.56s)]
*  and I said to myself, and then we had all this little kind of cars and muscle [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=818.5999999999999s)]
*  beach and all of this stuff that did Hollywood. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=823.64s)]
*  I said, I gotta go to America. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=827.28s)]
*  I gotta go to America. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=828.7199999999999s)]
*  This Austria is not the place. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=830.04s)]
*  It was almost kind of like that my gene was over here, you know, so this is a, [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=831.64s)]
*  so it kind of, I gravitated towards America, not that they hated Austria, [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=837.3599999999999s)]
*  but I just wanted to leave and go do something different. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=842.2399999999999s)]
*  So my parents always saw me as being different. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=844.64s)]
*  So it was not a surprise to them that I wanted to go as soon as I was through [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=848.7199999999999s)]
*  with high school and trade school, uh, that I want to go into the military. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=852.76s)]
*  So I went into the military because after you go and serve in the military, [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=857.3599999999999s)]
*  then you can get your passport and you can travel. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=860.76s)]
*  So you had to, you had to go to the military to get your passport in Austria. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=863.16s)]
*  That's right. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=866.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=866.4399999999999s)]
*  Is it still that way? [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=866.5999999999999s)]
*  No, I don't think it's different now. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=867.9599999999999s)]
*  Everything is different because everything has changed. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=869.4399999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=872.2399999999999s)]
*  And you had a brother as well, right? [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=872.5999999999999s)]
*  Was he, did he go to the military? [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=874.2399999999999s)]
*  He was in the military and, uh, he was a year older. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=876.0799999999999s)]
*  Oh, cool. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=880.2399999999999s)]
*  What's his name? [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=880.68s)]
*  Minehut. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=881.1999999999999s)]
*  Minehut. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=882.1999999999999s)]
*  Minehut. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=882.8s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=883.1999999999999s)]
*  So he was a year earlier, but he passed away as you know, at the very age of [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=883.7199999999999s)]
*  24. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=890.36s)]
*  Oh, I didn't know that. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=891.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=891.92s)]
*  It was like a drunk driver. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=892.72s)]
*  That's him right there? [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=893.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=894.32s)]
*  No, this is Dish. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=894.96s)]
*  This is Franz Dishinger. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=895.8000000000001s)]
*  He was my training partner in Munich. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=897.24s)]
*  So when I went, I went first, after the army, the Austrian army, I immediately [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=899.52s)]
*  left to go to Munich because I got an offer because now at that meantime, I [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=904.84s)]
*  became the European champion in bodybuilding in the junior division. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=910.76s)]
*  Okay. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=914.04s)]
*  So you go through the military. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=914.28s)]
*  So yeah, so it became this, while I was in the military, I won this title, [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=915.48s)]
*  best built man of Europe, junior. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=919.16s)]
*  God. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=921.88s)]
*  You know, I was 18 years old. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=922.24s)]
*  So now I get this offer in Munich, it's the biggest gym to go and become a trainer. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=923.52s)]
*  So I said, okay, I'm going to serve out my term here, get out of here a year later. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=929.4399999999999s)]
*  And then I go to Munich and I become a trainer there. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=935.7199999999999s)]
*  Now then I can train anytime, 24 hours a day, because I actually lived in the gym. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=938.48s)]
*  So I could get up, literally, if I wake up at three in the morning and, you know, I [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=946.4399999999999s)]
*  can, let's say, I can fall back to sleep. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=950.36s)]
*  I go out to the gym. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=952.8399999999999s)]
*  How did you live in there? [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=953.9599999999999s)]
*  Like where they just had a bed in the side or something? [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=954.88s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=956.9599999999999s)]
*  It was a little room. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=957.4s)]
*  It was from here to there where you would sit and a bed and just a little kind of a [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=958.8s)]
*  thing with a cabinet with drawers. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=964.24s)]
*  I put my stuff in. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=966.76s)]
*  That was it. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=967.88s)]
*  That was it. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=969.28s)]
*  And then I walked out of it. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=969.7199999999999s)]
*  It used to be an office there for the gym. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=970.68s)]
*  And I just moved in there because I had no money. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=973.1999999999999s)]
*  And you were like, this is what I do all the time. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=975.88s)]
*  Anyway, this is like, yeah. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=977.4s)]
*  So I was, I was in heaven. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=978.5600000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=980.04s)]
*  Are you kidding me? [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=980.5600000000001s)]
*  I mean, I went out there, turned on the lights and I was posing with the overhead [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=981.12s)]
*  lights and I was posing in the mirror all the time at night. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=984.88s)]
*  I would wake up and I would go out there posing and stuff. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=988.04s)]
*  So I was like, you know, very intense and very passionate about bodybuilding and [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=990.64s)]
*  perfecting my body and going to London to that very same contest that Reg Park won [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=997.24s)]
*  the Mr. Universe. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=1002.48s)]
*  And that very same year when I went out to Munich, 1966, I became now Mr. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=1003.4s)]
*  Europe literally two months later and then best buildman of Europe. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=1009.5600000000001s)]
*  And then I went to the Mr. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=1013.6s)]
*  Universe contest with the age of 19. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=1014.6s)]
*  I was the youngest competitor and I came second. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=1016.9200000000001s)]
*  And where was that held at? [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=1020.44s)]
*  It was in London. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=1021.52s)]
*  The same stage as Reg Park. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=1022.16s)]
*  So you still hadn't made it to the U S yet. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=1023.8000000000001s)]
*  No, no, not yet. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=1026.1200000000001s)]
*  No, no. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=1027.04s)]
*  And was your brother also lifting weights? [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=1027.32s)]
*  Was he a weightlifter? [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=1029.08s)]
*  No, he was not interested in that. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=1029.84s)]
*  He was much more, I think, academic, I would say, because he read a lot and he [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=1032.64s)]
*  started out, he was really good in school. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=1039.3600000000001s)]
*  I was not that good in school. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=1041.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=1042.8s)]
*  It's just so, so. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=1042.96s)]
*  Did you guys get along pretty well? [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=1044.08s)]
*  Is that him or no? [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=1045.28s)]
*  That's him. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=1046.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=1046.68s)]
*  That's mine. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=1046.8s)]
*  That's a cool. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=1047.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=1048.44s)]
*  What is mine? [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=1048.64s)]
*  Mine hot. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=1049.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=1050.04s)]
*  Mine. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=1050.24s)]
*  Not. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=1050.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=1050.64s)]
*  I just wondered what it would be like, cause I have a brother too. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=1051.32s)]
*  So I'm just thinking sometimes like it would be, um, yeah, I just think about my [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=1053.3600000000001s)]
*  brother a lot. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=1057.52s)]
*  So I guess I was just curious what it was like. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=1058.04s)]
*  Um, what your brother was like. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=1060.4s)]
*  Well, he was different than me, but we did hang out together. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=1062.16s)]
*  He did come to the gym every so often and he worked out with me, but he was not into it. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=1065.16s)]
*  He wasn't passionate. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=1069.76s)]
*  He is naturally, he had a better body than I had. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=1070.52s)]
*  Oh, really? [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=1073.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=1073.8400000000001s)]
*  He had a really V-shaped body at wide shoulders, a very, very small waist. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=1074.0s)]
*  God, they always give it to the person that doesn't want it. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=1078.6000000000001s)]
*  I know. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=1080.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=1081.52s)]
*  We had a guy like that. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=1081.96s)]
*  But that's, I think what is interesting about it is that you struggle much more [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=1082.88s)]
*  in the beginning and to catch up and then all of a sudden, you know, you see your own [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=1087.6399999999999s)]
*  potential, you know, which is, you don't see it in the beginning, but then, I mean, [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=1092.52s)]
*  I think it was like going to the gym was my first time where I got compliments [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=1097.6399999999999s)]
*  because my parents weren't into that. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=1105.28s)]
*  Was it popular? [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=1107.1999999999998s)]
*  It was an Austrian kind of upbringing, kind of everything, they correct everything. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=1107.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=1111.3999999999999s)]
*  Then the grades are no good and the soccer, why didn't you kick the ball? [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=1111.76s)]
*  You were like 10 yards away from the goal. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=1116.84s)]
*  You didn't kick it in. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=1119.08s)]
*  You tripped over the ball. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=1120.0s)]
*  I mean, come on out. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=1120.76s)]
*  It was always some kind of a complaint. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=1122.8799999999999s)]
*  Always trying to correct you. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=1124.08s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=1125.04s)]
*  That's right. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=1125.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=1126.04s)]
*  It was always a complaint. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=1126.28s)]
*  And then if you made a mistake, you get smacked and stuff like that. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=1127.48s)]
*  So it was that kind of upbringing. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=1130.84s)]
*  But it was very helpful to me because it actually gave me the [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=1132.48s)]
*  motivation to leave Austria. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=1135.6s)]
*  And it gives you control. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=1137.92s)]
*  I mean, if your weight, if your bodybuilding, it's just you against you. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=1139.12s)]
*  There's no, you don't have to depend on anybody else. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=1142.0s)]
*  I mean, I guess you have to depend on the judges when you go to actually compete, [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=1144.6399999999999s)]
*  but day to day it is you against your own emotions and mentality and ability. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=1148.7199999999998s)]
*  Yes. [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=1154.84s)]
*  But also at the same time, even though it is a sport that you are on your own, [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=1155.3999999999999s)]
*  but then the end, you still rely on your training partners. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=1160.3999999999999s)]
*  I was very fortunate. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=1163.4399999999998s)]
*  Always stood ahead. [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=1164.76s)]
*  The mentality of, of being able to attract the best training partners. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=1166.6s)]
*  So I had guys that were as hungry as I was, because that's the important thing. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=1172.48s)]
*  If you have someone that is not as hungry, then it doesn't really mean anything. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=1176.44s)]
*  If you have someone that competes with you, that counts out the reps, then he [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=1179.84s)]
*  wants to do an extra two reps more than you do and you get up to weight and all [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=1183.44s)]
*  this stuff. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=1187.08s)]
*  So always has good training about it. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=1187.52s)]
*  So I'm a big believer in that we really can't do anything by ourselves. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=1188.92s)]
*  That's why we say, don't call me a self-made man, because I'm a product of a [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=1193.88s)]
*  lot of, lot of help if it is in bodybuilding or just, I mean, think [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=1198.0s)]
*  about Joe Weider after winning two Mr. [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=1202.04s)]
*  Universe titles in London, the amateur Mr. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=1204.68s)]
*  Universe, the following year, 1968, the professional Mr. [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=1208.3999999999999s)]
*  Universe. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=1211.8s)]
*  So I was like the youngest Mr. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=1212.6399999999999s)]
*  Universe ever. [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=1214.12s)]
*  And that was the year after you got second? [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=1215.08s)]
*  That's right. [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=1216.8799999999999s)]
*  Okay. [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=1217.44s)]
*  1966, I was 20 years old and I want to become the youngest Mr. [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=1217.84s)]
*  Universe. [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=1225.3999999999999s)]
*  So now I'm then at stage exactly where Reg Park was and when Mr. [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=1225.68s)]
*  Universe, and not only that, but the Reg Park immediately sent me a fax and [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=1230.92s)]
*  to London is I don't invite you to South Africa to give posing exhibitions and do [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=1239.0800000000002s)]
*  a strongman act down there. [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=1244.0800000000002s)]
*  So I was invited by Reg Park to eventually then within a, by end of the [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=1245.64s)]
*  year, I went down to South Africa. [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=1249.96s)]
*  And you still hadn't gone to the US yet. [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=1251.48s)]
*  I haven't gone to the US. [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=1253.0800000000002s)]
*  What brought me to the US was, which was kind of my dream. [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=1254.2s)]
*  Someone would notice me in bodybuilding that it would take me to a bigger, [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=1258.52s)]
*  because bodybuilding was an American sport. [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=1261.68s)]
*  Oh, it was. [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=1264.0s)]
*  Another European sport. [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=1264.52s)]
*  It was American sport really. [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=1265.52s)]
*  And so I always had to get this invitation from Joe Weider, who was the [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=1267.2s)]
*  publisher of the muscle magazines. [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=1272.52s)]
*  He published like four big muscle magazines, Flex and Strength and Health. [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=1274.5600000000002s)]
*  And all of these magazines. [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=1278.3200000000002s)]
*  Oh yeah, we used to get some of them, I think, when I was a kid. [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=1280.1200000000001s)]
*  And Muscle and Fitness. [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=1283.0400000000002s)]
*  All of this. [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=1285.2s)]
*  And he had also an equipment company, the food supplement company. [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=1285.72s)]
*  Because it's weights, right? [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=1288.88s)]
*  I've seen the weights before. [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=1289.76s)]
*  It's weights. [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=1290.76s)]
*  It's the food supplements. [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=1292.3600000000001s)]
*  It's, and his brother was the head of the organization, the Bodybuilding Federation. [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=1293.8s)]
*  And this is when you came to the US? [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=1298.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=1300.04s)]
*  So he brought me over in 1968. [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=1300.2s)]
*  Okay. [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=1302.6000000000001s)]
*  Before we get there, Arnold, and not to interrupt you or anything, but you did a [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=1302.8400000000001s)]
*  show, you went to like one of the first interracial shows that was in South Africa? [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=1306.52s)]
*  That was later on. [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=1311.96s)]
*  Oh, that was later on. [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=1313.0800000000002s)]
*  Okay. [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=1313.64s)]
*  So it was 1975. [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=1313.8400000000001s)]
*  Got it. [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=1315.1200000000001s)]
*  Okay. [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=1315.3600000000001s)]
*  So you get to the US. [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=1315.6s)]
*  Very good research. [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=1317.6799999999998s)]
*  Do you remember your first, thank you. [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=1318.6799999999998s)]
*  Do you remember your first day in America? [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=1320.9199999999998s)]
*  Oh, yes. [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=1323.32s)]
*  It was in Miami. [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=1324.28s)]
*  I went to Miami and I was competing there in a competition. [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=1326.7199999999998s)]
*  And then after that, I came out to California and I was picked up in [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=1332.0s)]
*  California at the airport by a bodybuilding photographer with the name of Ari Zeller. [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=1337.28s)]
*  And Dick Tyler, who wrote for the muscle magazines, they picked me up and took me [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=1343.9199999999998s)]
*  to an apartment that Joe Weider rented for me and it was fantastic. [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=1349.32s)]
*  I mean, from then on, I got all the help in the world now, because that's when I [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=1354.4799999999998s)]
*  really realized the generosity of the American people. [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=1359.0s)]
*  Wow. [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=1363.1999999999998s)]
*  I mean, they gave me, I mean, the bodybuilders, there was Thanksgiving came up after that. [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=1363.4799999999998s)]
*  Because I came over here in October, November was Thanksgiving. [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=1368.32s)]
*  So there was, there was like this whole thing about, you know, giving me pillows [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=1371.8799999999999s)]
*  and giving me blankets and giving me dishes and silverware. [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=1378.0s)]
*  Where were you homeless or something? [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=1381.8s)]
*  Let's say again. [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=1383.44s)]
*  Why were they giving you all that? [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=1384.04s)]
*  Oh, just to make you feel welcome. [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=1385.48s)]
*  When you move into an apartment, what do you get? [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=1386.72s)]
*  I mean, it was a furnished apartment. [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=1389.68s)]
*  And you were living in LA at that point? [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=1391.12s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=1392.4s)]
*  It was in the valley over there in the valley. [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=1392.68s)]
*  And then all these bodybuilders came to me and they brought me all this stuff. [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=1395.16s)]
*  It was like unbelievable. [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=1398.96s)]
*  So I could not even believe how generous they were. [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=1399.88s)]
*  And this was, this was a lot of times people that didn't know me at all. [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=1404.7600000000002s)]
*  But just because bodybuilding and joining a club, you know, you become [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=1408.44s)]
*  kind of part of that family. [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=1413.5200000000002s)]
*  And so they were very, very sweet and kind. [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=1415.96s)]
*  And I would never forget that. [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=1418.1200000000001s)]
*  That's actually what made me then think about, well, when I ever make it, I [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=1419.44s)]
*  will give that back, I will help other people myself, you know. [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=1424.0s)]
*  What's it like finding a gym that really fits you? [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=1427.2s)]
*  Like, what's that like at that level of bodybuilding? [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=1430.24s)]
*  Were there a couple gyms you tried out and you're like, this isn't it. [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=1432.68s)]
*  Or did you already know where you wanted to be? [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=1435.28s)]
*  I came over here. [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=1439.1200000000001s)]
*  There was a gym called Vince's gym that had all the champions training. [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=1439.76s)]
*  Where was that located? [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=1444.96s)]
*  It was over in the valley, in Vendura, Polovac and North Hollywood. [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=1445.92s)]
*  And they're very, very famous gym. [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=1450.88s)]
*  You know, Larry Scott, Mr. [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=1453.12s)]
*  Olympia trained and, and Don Howard, who was Mr. [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=1454.48s)]
*  America and Don Peterson, all those guys were training there. [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=1457.3999999999999s)]
*  And then I ventured over here every so often for powerlifting. [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=1460.44s)]
*  There was a gym called Gold's gym. [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=1465.08s)]
*  Not many bodybuilders trained there. [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=1468.24s)]
*  Some, but I mean, not many, most of them were like shot putters and power [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=1470.3999999999999s)]
*  lifters and lift weightlifters and so on. [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=1474.6s)]
*  And it was a much more rough gym, but somehow because of the Austrian gym, [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=1477.12s)]
*  I kind of started the first three years in this weightlifting club. [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=1481.6s)]
*  It reminded me of that. [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=1484.76s)]
*  So I started getting more and more attracted to that gym. [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=1486.4399999999998s)]
*  And then I moved from the valley over here to Venice and, uh, it was still [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=1489.3999999999999s)]
*  part of Santa Monica, actually it was, uh, you know, Ashland, one of the [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=1495.12s)]
*  streets not far away from here. [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=1499.1599999999999s)]
*  And, uh, then I went daily training there and then Gold's gym. [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=1501.32s)]
*  Then other bodybuilders came from all over the country to train there too. [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=1504.76s)]
*  Because you were there because- [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=1509.0s)]
*  Well, I was there and that was Joe Weider now started writing in his [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=1510.08s)]
*  magazines about Arnold is training in Gold's gym and, uh, you know, if you [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=1513.56s)]
*  want to go and train in a great place, this is the place to go. [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=1519.0s)]
*  Was it hard for you to train? [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=1521.8799999999999s)]
*  I mean, were people at that point just standing around watching you train? [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=1522.9199999999998s)]
*  No, because there was a lot of, you know, I mean, this place [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=1526.6399999999999s)]
*  was filled with great bodybuilders. [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=1530.8s)]
*  Oh, I see. [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=1532.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=1532.72s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=1532.8s)]
*  So then others came out here from Florida and from Kentucky and from New York. [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=1533.12s)]
*  And they all started joining Gold's gym instead of training there. [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=1538.32s)]
*  So this was kind of like the place that had the best bodybuilders in the world. [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=1541.28s)]
*  Training in course that's how Gold's gym became famous, you know, because [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=1547.04s)]
*  it was a little gym, it was not big. [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=1550.64s)]
*  It was 3000 square feet. [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=1552.08s)]
*  I think it was. [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=1554.68s)]
*  Well, I remember when I first moved to Los Angeles, we went to [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=1555.56s)]
*  Firehouse, I don't know if it's still there or not. [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=1558.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=1559.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=1559.96s)]
*  Firehouse. [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=1560.0s)]
*  Was that the place? [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=1560.48s)]
*  It was a big protein place. [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=1560.88s)]
*  It was like a, was that, I think it was- [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=1562.0s)]
*  Well, Firehouse now is, is, is a restaurant down there. [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=1563.56s)]
*  It used to be like a place where you could get literally like a bowl of chicken. [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=1567.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=1571.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=1572.04s)]
*  You still can get there. [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=1572.1599999999999s)]
*  You can get great scrambled eggs. [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=1573.32s)]
*  You get like 30 eggs or whatever. [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=1575.28s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=1576.4799999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=1577.04s)]
*  It's crazy. [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=1577.12s)]
*  It was like, yeah, I remember I ate, I ordered like a month worth of [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=1577.6s)]
*  food right there just for one, just at lunch. [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=1580.6399999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=1583.3999999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=1584.08s)]
*  It took me like five hours to get out of there just cause I didn't want to like- [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=1584.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=1587.28s)]
*  I was never a big eater. [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=1587.4399999999998s)]
*  So to me that meant nothing. [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=1588.9599999999998s)]
*  If I had a little steak and some two scrambled eggs, I was perfectly fine. [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=1590.6s)]
*  I was full. [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=1594.8799999999999s)]
*  For the day? [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=1595.52s)]
*  Not for the day. [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=1596.3999999999999s)]
*  No, but let's say in the mornings, steak and eggs or scrambled eggs or something [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=1597.12s)]
*  like this, I always had to take protein drinks in between meals because I could [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=1601.6399999999999s)]
*  never eat enough to get my 250 grams of protein because I weighed 250 pounds. [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=1606.8s)]
*  And the idea then was that for every kind of pound of body weight you [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=1612.4399999999998s)]
*  have, you should have one gram of protein. [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=1616.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=1618.1999999999998s)]
*  When, cause I used to buy, I don't know if I used to bodybuild, I used to use [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=1619.1999999999998s)]
*  steroids when I was like growing up and just lift weights a lot. [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=1622.96s)]
*  I loved it for years, you know? [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=1625.44s)]
*  And I think whenever I get like, you know, whenever I quit working as much, I'll [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=1627.2s)]
*  probably try to get back more weight lifting. [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=1632.0s)]
*  Was steroids pretty popular then or what was it like? [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=1635.1200000000001s)]
*  Was that part of the, cause I'm sure it was part of the culture. [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=1637.6000000000001s)]
*  It was not yet, but it was something that was in the beginning, very experimental. [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=1640.3600000000001s)]
*  So would you hear it? [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=1646.1200000000001s)]
*  Like, would it be like on the black market or it was just like public? [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=1647.04s)]
*  It was just like, people would talk about it like as a supplement. [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=1650.2s)]
*  It might be in some places was in the black market. [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=1652.6s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=1655.48s)]
*  But the, all I know is, is that we always went to a doctor because they [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=1656.52s)]
*  want to make sure that they measure your blood pressure and they check your [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=1660.64s)]
*  health and all of that stuff, because it has side effects. [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=1663.16s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=1666.6s)]
*  And especially if you take it beyond of what they recommend. [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=1667.2s)]
*  So if they recommend, let's say one shot a week and you start taking one [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=1671.16s)]
*  shot a day or something, which is of course the, the case a lot of today. [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=1674.48s)]
*  That people are overdosing and that's why you see some bodybuilders [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=1679.28s)]
*  actually die because of the overdose of drugs and all this stuff. [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=1682.28s)]
*  Did you see friends go down that road or people as other bodybuilders go down [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=1685.8s)]
*  that road where they were get addicted to it? [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=1688.72s)]
*  No, not in my days. [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=1690.24s)]
*  It was the new, but now it's, I think really somewhat, I would say out of control. [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=1692.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=1697.92s)]
*  Is a sequel better than the original? [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=1699.3999999999999s)]
*  We're going to find out at UFC three 16. [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=1702.32s)]

*  Whenever you start, like you've had such an interesting life and career, you've gotten to do so [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=1865.9599999999998s)]
*  many things. Was there a time period in your life that you wish you had maybe done like a [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=1870.8s)]
*  little bit different? [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=1875.96s)]
*  No, there's no move that ever made career wise. [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=1877.6399999999999s)]
*  I thought that I had a real good nose when to make my moves forward and when I should [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=1882.84s)]
*  retire from bodybuilding, when I felt like, OK, I don't have the joy anymore. [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=1888.6399999999999s)]
*  After five Mr. Universe competitions that I won, Mr. World and Mr. Olympia six times, I retired in [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=1895.24s)]
*  1975 after that competition in South Africa that you mentioned just earlier. [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=1903.44s)]
*  So that was kind of the last competition. [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=1909.2s)]
*  I did come back in 1980 again for the Mr. Olympia, but that was really just an afterthought. [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=1911.16s)]
*  But I mean, really, I retired in 1975. [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=1918.48s)]
*  After the South African show? [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=1921.6s)]
*  Yeah, after the South African show. [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=1923.2s)]
*  Tell me a little bit about that, because I bet it was really interesting. [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=1924.28s)]
*  Just South Africa is probably my favorite country. [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=1926.44s)]
*  I mean, it is beautiful. [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=1928.32s)]
*  It is a gorgeous country. [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=1929.6399999999999s)]
*  And of course, at that time, blacks and whites and everyone was separated. [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=1931.6s)]
*  I mean, separated meaning they had different rights. [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=1938.04s)]
*  You know, the whites were the ones that ruled the country. [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=1941.04s)]
*  The blacks were kind of kept down. [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=1943.96s)]
*  Was Desmond Tutu down there at the time? [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=1945.72s)]
*  Do you know if he was speaking? [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=1947.32s)]
*  Yes, of course he was. [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=1948.12s)]
*  But I mean, the whites really were kind of in control. [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=1949.36s)]
*  They were the kind of the leaders of it. [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=1954.9599999999998s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=1956.12s)]
*  The Dutch and the British. [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=1956.6799999999998s)]
*  There was always a fight between those two in the parliament and all that. [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=1958.0s)]
*  And so then I got to meet and to know the minister of immigration. [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=1961.6s)]
*  And he was also minister of sports and minister of labor and blah, blah, blah. [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=1968.9599999999998s)]
*  So he was a very, very powerful guy in administration. [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=1973.3999999999999s)]
*  And he, when I met him, he said to me, Arnold, when you come over here to South Africa [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=1976.8s)]
*  and you do posing exhibitions and strongman acts, you should also go to the townships. [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=1983.28s)]
*  To the townships? [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=1989.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=1990.4399999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=1990.8s)]
*  So I said the townships. [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=1991.04s)]
*  Like the Soweto's? [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=1992.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=1994.24s)]
*  So I said, of course I did not know. [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=1994.8799999999999s)]
*  And so he then explained it to me. [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=1997.32s)]
*  And then he would organize with the Reg Park together for me to go in, because he [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=1999.6399999999999s)]
*  was not what we call the safest place in town. [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2006.12s)]
*  Not that they wanted to do harm to you, but I mean, for someone like me to come [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2009.08s)]
*  in there and to do a demonstration there. [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2014.4399999999998s)]
*  Oh, I mean, everyone, everyone got lit. [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2016.84s)]
*  I mean, they were drunk. [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2019.9599999999998s)]
*  They were celebrating that someone will come in and give them the respect [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2021.28s)]
*  and do something special for them. [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2025.3999999999999s)]
*  So very appreciative, right? [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2027.0s)]
*  So I will go in there and I was in the cage. [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2028.52s)]
*  And to the Soweto's, is that what it's called? [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2031.4799999999998s)]
*  Can you bring that up for me, Nick? [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2032.8799999999999s)]
*  Yeah, the townships, they're all over the place. [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2033.8s)]
*  In every town in South Africa, there's townships like that. [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2036.28s)]
*  There's places where the blacks would live, right? [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2040.28s)]
*  In a very, very kind of flow. [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2042.7199999999998s)]
*  I think they're called the Soweto's. [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2043.84s)]
*  That's one of them. [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2045.8s)]
*  Yeah, Soweto's. [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2046.8799999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I think so. [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2047.7199999999998s)]
*  So in any case, so I will go in there and do a demonstration, do my posing and the [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2049.7999999999997s)]
*  lift weights and all of this kind of stuff. [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2054.96s)]
*  In these small townships? [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2056.72s)]
*  Yeah, there was like thousands of them surrounding and then just screaming [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2058.96s)]
*  loud and having the greatest time. [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2063.88s)]
*  And then we would go out. [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2065.76s)]
*  Oh, they would put you on the grill. [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2066.56s)]
*  I'm surprised. [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2067.76s)]
*  I bet they were star so hungry sometimes they would be like, look at this wealth. [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2068.08s)]
*  It was fantastic. [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2071.4s)]
*  The reception and everything. [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2073.28s)]
*  So the reason I mentioned that is because it led to the conversation with, you know, [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2074.36s)]
*  that minister of sports. [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2083.2400000000002s)]
*  And he said to me, he says, we should have an international competition here in South [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2086.2799999999997s)]
*  Africa. [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2095.2799999999997s)]
*  He says, we should work together on that. [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2096.48s)]
*  And I said, okay, we will. [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2099.04s)]
*  And his name was Dr. [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2100.7999999999997s)]
*  Kornhof. [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2103.0s)]
*  Dr. [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2105.08s)]
*  Kornhof. [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2105.56s)]
*  And he was an extraordinary man. [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2107.24s)]
*  Very, very smart. [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2109.08s)]
*  But it just shows you that there was people like him that already wanted to do more for [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2110.44s)]
*  the blacks and to elevate them. [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2116.4s)]
*  So he then I set him up with Ben Weider, with Joe Weider's brother, who was the head of [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2120.6s)]
*  the International Federation of Bodybuilding. [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2126.16s)]
*  They got together and they hit it off really well. [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2128.76s)]
*  And so Joe Weider and Ben Weider worked with him to bring the Mr. [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2132.24s)]
*  Olympia contest to South Africa, to Pretoria, the capital of South Africa. [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2136.4s)]
*  But the conditions were that they were able to have a mixed audience. [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2141.6800000000003s)]
*  Okay. [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2148.64s)]
*  So black and white audience, had they done that ever? [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2149.0s)]
*  Never. [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2151.08s)]
*  Wow. [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2151.8s)]
*  So there was the first time there was black, was blacks, but there was not just black and [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2152.2400000000002s)]
*  white in South Africa. [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2157.88s)]
*  There was a group that was called blacks. [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2159.44s)]
*  There was a group that was called colored. [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2162.1600000000003s)]
*  There was a group that was called Indians. [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2163.7200000000003s)]
*  There was a group that was white. [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2166.2799999999997s)]
*  I mean, there was like five different Asians. [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2167.68s)]
*  So everyone was different. [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2169.96s)]
*  A lot of variety. [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2171.68s)]
*  It was kind of like, it was not considered we are all equal there. [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2172.88s)]
*  Right. [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2176.36s)]
*  And so what Ben negotiated was that we have a mixed audience that anyone, no matter what [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2177.12s)]
*  their nationality and what their kind of color is, or religious beliefs, anyone should be [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2182.52s)]
*  able to come to this competition. [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2188.8s)]
*  And also not only that, but to be a judge, we will have also half black and half white [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2190.92s)]
*  judges, blah, blah, blah. [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2196.56s)]
*  So was that scary to go before a black judge? [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2197.96s)]
*  Did you think that they would judge you fairly? [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2201.08s)]
*  I would be. [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2202.72s)]
*  No, not at all. [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2203.6s)]
*  Because they were not. [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2205.2799999999997s)]
*  I mean, I was competing in America at that time already. [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2206.4s)]
*  Oh, you were used to it. [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2208.92s)]
*  And I was used to it. [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2209.24s)]
*  There was Leary Colbert, who was the first guy with the 21, 22 inch arms, big, big [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2210.52s)]
*  bodybuilder from the fifties and sixties. [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2215.72s)]
*  And he was a judge in New York several times and he was a totally honest judge. [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2218.24s)]
*  There was other black judges that said it was that that's the great thing about bodybuilding. [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2224.2799999999997s)]
*  Bodybuilding, there was no prejudice. [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2229.2s)]
*  There were some people in bodybuilding that were prejudiced. [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2232.12s)]
*  But in general, like especially under the Weeders, the Weeders, I think because they [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2235.2799999999997s)]
*  were Jewish. [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2240.0s)]
*  Bring up Ben Weeders. [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2240.96s)]
*  I think it had something to do with the fact that they were that kind of open minded about it. [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2242.28s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2247.88s)]
*  A lot of times they're the leaders in promoting diversity. [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2248.36s)]
*  That's right. [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2253.08s)]
*  Yes. [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2253.6s)]
*  So there was no prejudice. [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2253.8s)]
*  There was no prejudice there at all. [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2254.8s)]
*  And as a matter of fact, there was a guy by the name of Bob Hoffman. [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2257.88s)]
*  He always made sure that when they had the AAU had the Mr. [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2261.84s)]
*  America competition, only whites could win. [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2265.52s)]
*  No black could win there. [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2268.96s)]
*  Oh, really? [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2270.2400000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2270.88s)]
*  So there was really embarrassing. [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2271.12s)]
*  So there were some barriers within the. [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2273.2000000000003s)]
*  There was guys like Sergio Liva that would be competing in 1966 or 1965 in the Mr. [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2274.52s)]
*  America and he would get beaten by white guys. [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2280.56s)]
*  And it was totally unfair. [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2283.52s)]
*  Or Harold Poole got beaten in 1963 by Bern Weaver, which I thought was unfair. [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2284.7200000000003s)]
*  So it was there was this. [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2289.52s)]
*  So what they did then was because there was now two federations, there was the IFBB, there [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2291.08s)]
*  was the AAU in Napa. [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2295.96s)]
*  AAU? [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2297.52s)]
*  AAU. [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2298.36s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2298.96s)]
*  American Athletic Union. [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2299.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2300.96s)]
*  And so they then went from that federation over to the IFBB and there Sergio Liva won [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2301.44s)]
*  immediately. [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2307.44s)]
*  Got it. [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2308.1600000000003s)]
*  He became Mr. [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2308.56s)]
*  America, became Mr. [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2309.2400000000002s)]
*  World and Mr. [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2310.6s)]
*  Universe, then Mr. [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2311.4s)]
*  Olympia. [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2312.44s)]
*  And he actually in the first Mr. [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2313.28s)]
*  Olympia competition, Sergio Liva beat me. [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2314.88s)]
*  Wow. [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2317.2000000000003s)]
*  1969, fairly. [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2317.6s)]
*  I mean, there was no complaints there at all because he was extraordinary. [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2319.76s)]
*  Right. [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2322.92s)]
*  And so then in 1970, I came back and I beat him in the Mr. [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2323.56s)]
*  World competition in Columbus, Ohio. [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2328.0s)]
*  And then two weeks later in the Mr. [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2330.12s)]
*  Olympia in New York. [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2332.12s)]
*  So we were big rivals and that was of course a big admirer of his and a big idol. [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2333.44s)]
*  And he treated me really well. [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2338.84s)]
*  He went to Chicago and trained together at the Duncan YMCA and all that stuff. [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2340.76s)]
*  I wanted to learn from him. [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2345.56s)]
*  I love the YMCA, don't you? [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2346.68s)]
*  Oh, absolutely. [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2348.12s)]
*  It's great. [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2349.2400000000002s)]
*  I've always been a fan of the YMCA. [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2349.96s)]
*  It just kind of like, they're always a little bit met, like it's never perfect there, but [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2351.84s)]
*  everything's kind of like a little bit old enough where I like the equipment, you know, [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2355.84s)]
*  it's never too fancy. [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2359.4s)]
*  Yeah, but you can get the job done. [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2360.84s)]
*  Right. [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2362.2000000000003s)]
*  So to me, it's not about the luxury. [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2362.52s)]
*  It's just much more about the will to succeed. [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2365.56s)]
*  And when I see pictures online of bodybuilders that are training in the sand in Africa right [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2369.7200000000003s)]
*  now, blacks, that are having cement weights on a bar. [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2378.52s)]
*  God. [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2383.96s)]
*  And a cheap bench. [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2384.6800000000003s)]
*  And when they do their bench press. [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2387.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2389.24s)]
*  And the other day I saw one of those kind of videos and they get up from the bench. [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2389.7999999999997s)]
*  I'm looking at it as this guy could win Mr. America or win Mr. California or something [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2396.44s)]
*  like that. [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2400.52s)]
*  He looks extraordinary. [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2400.92s)]
*  So it's really not the technology so much. [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2402.2799999999997s)]
*  It helps you, but I mean, on the end, it is really what you have to work on is the will. [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2407.48s)]
*  Oh, the will was the best. [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2411.56s)]
*  There's nothing better than just having like a little weight bench outside in your [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2413.24s)]
*  backyard or something and you go out there or in your garage. [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2416.3599999999997s)]
*  And it's just. [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2419.16s)]
*  I did my deadlift in front of the house in Graz in Tahr, which now is a museum [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2419.56s)]
*  and the house where I grew up in. [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2425.56s)]
*  Your home is a museum where you grew up? [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2426.8399999999997s)]
*  The home exactly. [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2428.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2429.3199999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2429.96s)]
*  I'm going to go with it in two weeks. [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2430.2s)]
*  We have a pump club is meeting there with the European bodybuilders members from the [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2431.64s)]
*  pump club. [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2437.16s)]
*  And then there's some Americans that are also coming over there. [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2437.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2440.76s)]
*  That audience in South Africa, what was did did it have the feeling during the show of [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2441.96s)]
*  like, this is like a novel thing. [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2447.96s)]
*  This is like a like, was there that energy in the in the in the event? [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2449.5600000000004s)]
*  So much energy in that auditorium and it was not a big auditorium. [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2454.5200000000004s)]
*  It maybe held, I would say. [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2459.88s)]
*  1500 people, I would guess. [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2462.84s)]
*  And it was the energy was fantastic. [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2467.48s)]
*  The joy of being together was fantastic. [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2470.44s)]
*  And I really think they had a tremendous impact also in the future of South Africa. [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2473.6400000000003s)]
*  And it was just wonderful that there were leaders there that believed in that and wanted [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2477.96s)]
*  to organize that and everyone, the police and everyone was really cooperative. [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2483.32s)]
*  Everyone worked together. [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2487.2400000000002s)]
*  So it was a fantastic show, a fantastic competition. [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2488.28s)]
*  And of course I won. [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2490.92s)]
*  So it's always a fantastic competition. [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2491.96s)]
*  You know, when he went, my sixth Mr. Olympia. [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2494.04s)]
*  But I what was interesting about it was I got a thousand dollars cash prize. [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2496.44s)]
*  And I was really upset about that because I felt like, wait a minute. [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2503.64s)]
*  In 1965, ten years ago, surgery, Larry Scott, when you won Mr. Olympia, got a thousand dollars. [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2510.52s)]
*  And now ten years later, we still get a thousand dollars. [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2519.0s)]
*  So that's what made me actually motivated to go then in front of the IFBB, the International [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2521.64s)]
*  Bodybuilding Congress, and to ask them for permission to organize the next year's Mr. [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2527.64s)]
*  Olympia in Columbus, Ohio. [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2533.4s)]
*  And that's exactly what we did. [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2536.2s)]
*  And I got the permission and then we upped the cash prize to $5,000, then to $10,000, [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2537.8799999999997s)]
*  to 20, we doubled it every year. [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2543.64s)]
*  And now we're giving over a million dollars away for cash prizes with the Arnold Classic. [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2545.56s)]
*  What's like one of the things right before you go on? [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2551.4s)]
*  Because I'm guessing you're backstage, right? [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2553.64s)]
*  You wait to go on and they call your name out and then you go out and do your poses. [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2555.64s)]
*  Is that how it goes? [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2559.08s)]
*  In those days, the way it worked was the whole lineup of all the competitors. [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2562.84s)]
*  Now, if them understand, Mr. Olympia means that you have to have won a world championship title [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2567.32s)]
*  before. [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2574.04s)]
*  So Mr. World, Mr. International, or Mr. Universe. [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2575.0s)]
*  So those guys are the top guys. [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2578.76s)]
*  So you have like six or seven guys that are on the stage. [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2580.5200000000004s)]
*  And so the judges, they ask you to order to come out. [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2584.36s)]
*  You have a certain time at one o'clock, be ready for pre-judging. [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2588.36s)]
*  And then you come out and then you stand there. [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2591.96s)]
*  And then the judges will shuffle you around. [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2594.76s)]
*  They say, okay, can number seven go over where number one is and number one goes over where [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2596.6800000000003s)]
*  number seven was? [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2601.6400000000003s)]
*  You know, they just see them next to each other, different people next to each other. [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2602.6800000000003s)]
*  They turn around, turn sideways. [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2606.68s)]
*  What's the scariest way to be turned? [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2610.6s)]
*  Like, was there ever a part where you're like, this is I got to kind of cheat this [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2612.12s)]
*  angle a little bit? [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2615.56s)]
*  No, I mean, for me, it was basically always a tremendous joy to be up on stage because [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2617.8799999999997s)]
*  it's one of those things where you feel like when you're really ready. [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2623.8799999999997s)]
*  I always felt kind of like in most cases that I was so ready that no matter what angle it was, [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2628.04s)]
*  I was ready to go and I had always a smile on my face and I flexed everything. [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2635.0s)]
*  And, you know, the key thing is that you have practiced your posing enough that you can [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2639.16s)]
*  stand there in a flex position. [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2644.36s)]
*  It looks relaxed. [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2647.48s)]
*  You stand there like this, but you still flex. [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2649.08s)]
*  You keep the stomach in and you keep the abs flexed and the calves flexed, the biceps, [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2651.4s)]
*  the triceps flexed. [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2656.2s)]
*  So that was the idea. [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2657.16s)]
*  And I was always having great joy with that. [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2658.36s)]
*  So it's a lot of acting too. [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2660.36s)]
*  It's kind of some acting up there. [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2661.56s)]
*  It is one of the great forms of acting. [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2662.76s)]
*  Why? [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2665.8s)]
*  Because you cannot go and say to the judge, look at me. [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2666.44s)]
*  I'm the most perfect up here. [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2671.1600000000003s)]
*  Look at my abs. [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2673.4s)]
*  No, you have to do all that without talking. [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2674.6800000000003s)]
*  You have to communicate with them and also with the audience. [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2677.2400000000002s)]
*  Because remember that the sound of the audience is very important because you want to get [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2679.96s)]
*  big applause. [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2684.84s)]
*  So the judge say, oh, this guy got the most applause. [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2685.48s)]
*  I mean, he definitely, you know, has the best body. [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2687.8s)]
*  But then you wait for the individual posing. [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2691.48s)]
*  So then you come at one after the next. [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2695.32s)]
*  You do a three minute posing routine. [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2697.4s)]
*  And what's the tricks there? [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2699.56s)]
*  Is there any trick of the trade, a last minute thing you use? [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2700.6000000000004s)]
*  You would like pinch your tits or just rub some just like molasses into your lint. [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2703.56s)]
*  Like, what was like a last minute thing people would do? [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2709.32s)]
*  Put ice under your arms or something? [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2712.04s)]
*  No, I think the key thing is just that when you go there, that you're so ready [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2713.96s)]
*  that you don't shake. [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2719.64s)]
*  You get how many bodybuilders, I'm sure you've seen it. [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2722.6s)]
*  They hit a shot and then they, after a few seconds, they start shaking. [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2725.64s)]
*  Oh, so that's bad. [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2730.2s)]
*  For that level. [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2731.8799999999997s)]
*  I mean, it's natural when you have a Mr. Venice Beach competition. [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2732.8399999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2735.72s)]
*  Mr. Muscle Beach. [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2735.96s)]
*  Or Mr. Montgomery, Alabama. [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2736.7599999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2738.2799999999997s)]
*  You know, beginners, of course, they make mistakes and they're not as well trained. [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2738.52s)]
*  But when you get to the Mr. Olympia level, it's unacceptable. [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2742.2799999999997s)]
*  Oh, so you want to make it look so that you want to [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2745.56s)]
*  hit the shot. [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2749.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2750.04s)]
*  And you smile. [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2750.92s)]
*  You look at the judges and you smile. [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2752.12s)]
*  And then you smoothly move into the next shot. [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2756.2s)]
*  Pop. [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2759.7999999999997s)]
*  Then it hands. [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2761.0s)]
*  And you just a movement. [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2762.2799999999997s)]
*  It has to be all very gracefully and no shaking. [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2763.88s)]
*  So that again, that you say to the judges, look, I am so ready for this. [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2767.64s)]
*  Unlike maybe the others. [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2773.3199999999997s)]
*  So that's what it is. [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2774.8399999999997s)]
*  So it's all about the seven piece. [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2776.68s)]
*  You know, the seven piece. [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2781.16s)]
*  Proper prior planning prevents pissed poor performance. [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2782.7599999999998s)]
*  The Marines, they have that. [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2788.68s)]
*  Proper prior planning prevents pissed poor performance. [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2790.6s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2793.72s)]
*  So that's what it's about. [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2794.52s)]
*  It's the same there. [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2795.56s)]
*  You come prepared. [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2796.9199999999996s)]
*  You make sure that you work. [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2798.7599999999998s)]
*  Everyone has weak points. [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2800.2799999999997s)]
*  So you have to make sure that you worked as much in your weak points [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2802.12s)]
*  so that the judges see that you're not blind. [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2805.88s)]
*  That you noticed that last year you maybe had not so defined legs. [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2809.2400000000002s)]
*  Yes, maybe you won, but the legs were so, so. [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2816.52s)]
*  And then the next time when you come back, you have to have ripped legs. [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2820.2000000000003s)]
*  Right. [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2822.92s)]
*  So then the judge said, that guy got the message. [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2823.56s)]
*  So this is what it's all about. [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2826.04s)]
*  Because in the end, you really are an artist. [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2827.1600000000003s)]
*  You're a sculptor. [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2833.48s)]
*  You're not just the athlete that's competing, but you're the sculptor. [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2834.36s)]
*  But you're sculpting on your own body instead of a chisel and a hammer [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2837.48s)]
*  that you kind of sculpt a physique. [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2842.44s)]
*  You do it now with machines and with the reps and the different exercises [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2847.0s)]
*  where you say, I need a little bit more of the rear deltoids. [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2850.84s)]
*  I need a little bit more separation in the front between the deltoid and the pectoral muscle. [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2853.6400000000003s)]
*  I need a little bit more cut in the lower abs. [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2858.92s)]
*  I need the calves have to be balanced. [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2861.8s)]
*  They're not big enough for the arms because it should be the same size as your arms. [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2863.8s)]
*  All of those kind of things. [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2868.04s)]
*  So you become kind of like an artist in your own body. [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2869.2400000000002s)]
*  That's what you had to use. [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2872.1200000000003s)]
*  Did you ever have to work out the top of your feet or your hand? [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2875.0800000000004s)]
*  Were there things you could do for your face even and stuff like that? [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2877.6400000000003s)]
*  No, no. [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2880.04s)]
*  I mean, people did pay attention to that. [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2882.1200000000003s)]
*  I didn't. [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2885.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2885.7200000000003s)]
*  To me, it's always about the bottom line. [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2886.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2889.2400000000002s)]
*  So what is it that we're doing here? [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2889.5600000000004s)]
*  What we're doing here is we're showing the most perfect physique [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2891.96s)]
*  and who is the best in actually displaying that physique [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2895.8s)]
*  because it's all about, you know, presentation, presentation, presentation. [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2900.44s)]
*  It's like a piece of art. [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2905.32s)]
*  You know, you can have a painting that is maybe amongst many other paintings [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2906.68s)]
*  and you wouldn't even notice there's a Picasso. [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2910.76s)]
*  But then when you put it up there on a white wall [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2913.2400000000002s)]
*  and in a beautiful gold frame with the special lighting [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2917.16s)]
*  and then you have someone talk about it, [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2920.84s)]
*  now you can auction something off for a lot of money. [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2922.76s)]
*  Ah. [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2925.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2925.2400000000002s)]
*  So it's all about presentation. [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2925.48s)]
*  And so this is why I think the same is also in bodybuilding [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2927.0s)]
*  and the way you present your body, the way you present your muscles. [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2930.6000000000004s)]
*  And did at that point, I mean, I can see now how even like [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2933.88s)]
*  lobbying for certain things to be changing in, like in the prize money. [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2936.36s)]
*  Right. [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2941.0s)]
*  I can almost see where your direction comes to even end up in politics. [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2941.1600000000003s)]
*  Right. [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2944.52s)]
*  You can start to see it like, well, this should be more. [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2944.6800000000003s)]
*  There should be some adjustments. [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2947.48s)]
*  You weren't just like a competitor. [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2948.76s)]
*  You were also somebody who was examining how things were run [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2949.96s)]
*  and how they could be better, especially when you were partnering with guys like [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2953.16s)]
*  Ben wider and stuff like that, and probably inspired by those guys to [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2956.36s)]
*  probably get this larger vision of things that were going on. [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2959.48s)]
*  Did you, when you got into film, so at that point, you know how to act, [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2964.28s)]
*  you know how to impress the front row, you know how to use probably every element [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2968.12s)]
*  of your body to impress people. [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2971.7200000000003s)]
*  So that kind of just leans leads kind of perfectly into acting. [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2973.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2977.56s)]
*  But remember that what is key and all of this stuff is also personality. [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2979.08s)]
*  And I don't know if you can train a personality or not. [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2984.52s)]
*  I mean, I don't know what you think about that, but I mean, [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2987.64s)]
*  I think some people just don't have the greatest person. [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2989.96s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2993.56s)]
*  Some people are boring. [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2993.96s)]
*  People have a great personality. [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2994.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2997.24s)]
*  You know, and so I think that they developed over the years, not that someone taught me that, [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=2997.72s)]
*  but I developed a personality because my joy for whatever I did came through. [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=3003.24s)]
*  So when people talk to me about bodybuilding in those days, I was not shy of the press. [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=3008.6s)]
*  Other bodybuilders for decades didn't talk to the press. [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=3013.72s)]
*  So when I came over here, people thought that when they saw my body, [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=3018.04s)]
*  they thought it was a football player or was a wrestler or something like that. [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=3021.0s)]
*  But the last thing they guessed was a bodybuilder. [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=3024.4399999999996s)]
*  So they didn't know about bodybuilding. [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=3026.6s)]
*  So I, in 1974, I hired, I was the first bodybuilder to hire a publicist. [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=3028.6s)]
*  And so we went and did talk shows, the Johnny Carson show, [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=3035.7999999999997s)]
*  Merv Griffin show, Mike Douglas show, and all of those shows. [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=3039.16s)]
*  And were there football teams that tried to get you to come and play for them? [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=3043.0s)]
*  Did you ever get an offer? [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=3045.4s)]
*  No, because I mean, I think I made it very clear in my interviews [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=3046.68s)]
*  that my vision is to be the greatest bodybuilder of all times and to go then into acting. [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=3050.44s)]
*  So even when people came to me, because I was always very good in business, [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=3055.64s)]
*  I studied business, I got my degree in business. [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=3059.64s)]
*  While I was over here doing the training for bodybuilding. [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=3062.68s)]
*  At SMC? [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=3065.08s)]
*  Second. [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=3065.72s)]
*  Did you go to SMC? [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=3066.52s)]
*  I went to Santa Monica City College, to UCLA, and to, you know, got my degree in business. [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=3067.56s)]
*  And it was like business administration. [[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=3075.56s)]
*  And I was just naturally always gifted for making deals and being creative. [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=3078.6s)]
*  Got it. [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=3084.92s)]
*  And I always understood how it works. [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=3086.28s)]
*  So in bodybuilding, for instance, it's one thing to say, [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=3088.92s)]
*  okay, I'm going to up the cash price to $20,000. [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=3091.7200000000003s)]
*  Let's say from like within a three-year period, we had to give away $20,000 in the beginning. [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=3096.44s)]
*  But then you have to say, okay, where do we get this money from? [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=3103.96s)]
*  Sponsors. [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=3108.2000000000003s)]
*  And I have to go out and hustle the sponsors. [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=3109.1600000000003s)]
*  Now, of course, we have the biggest bodybuilding and fitness convention [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=3111.48s)]
*  in Columbus, Ohio, in the world. [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=3115.7200000000003s)]
*  We have 200,000 people coming through there in three days. [[00:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=3117.88s)]
*  We have every company displaying their products, their machines, [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=3121.4s)]
*  their food supplements, clothing. [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=3124.76s)]
*  At the Arnold's? [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=3126.04s)]
*  The Arnold's Classic. [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=3127.0s)]
*  Arnold Classic. [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=3127.96s)]
*  It's always the first week in March. [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=3128.6800000000003s)]
*  And it's three days, the whole thing. [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=3131.32s)]
*  So now, like I said, now we raise enough money where we can give away [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=3132.92s)]
*  over a million dollars. [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=3136.6000000000004s)]
*  As a matter of fact, this coming year, you're going to go up to a million and a half dollars. [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=3137.48s)]
*  Let's go. [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=3141.16s)]
*  So it's all kinds of great things happening. [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=3141.64s)]
*  But I was able to build it to that because I have a business mind. [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=3143.8s)]
*  Right. [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=3147.88s)]
*  And I know exactly how that works and how do we attract everyone [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=3148.12s)]
*  and bring everyone together. [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=3151.8s)]
*  Were there women all weightlifting at that time or no? [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=3153.88s)]
*  There were. [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=3156.36s)]
*  The first Miss Olympia competition was a guy by the name of Schneider. [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=3156.84s)]
*  From back East from the Philadelphia area. [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=3163.6400000000003s)]
*  And we did that together. [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=3169.0s)]
*  Oh, you guys started it? [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=3170.1200000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=3171.8s)]
*  Well, yes, because the women were all kind of complaining, why can we compete? [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=3172.0400000000004s)]
*  So we did a little, shall we call it Miss Olympia. [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=3176.36s)]
*  And because the International Federation of Bodybuilding at that point had no interest [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=3180.2000000000003s)]
*  in women bodybuilding. [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=3185.4s)]
*  Why was that, do you think? [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=3186.5200000000004s)]
*  Was it just their view of women at the time? [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=3188.1200000000003s)]
*  No, it was they were stuck and we created this federation for the guys. [[00:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=3190.12s)]
*  Oh, it's a boys club. [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=3195.64s)]
*  Why are we getting, it's like gym owners like Joe Gold. [[00:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=3197.16s)]
*  He would not let women train. [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=3200.92s)]
*  Why? [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=3203.24s)]
*  Because it was against women. [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=3204.04s)]
*  No, we love women coming in there, but he figured I don't have the room for another [[00:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=3205.16s)]
*  bathroom here. [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=3209.72s)]
*  I have 3000 square feet. [[00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=3210.7599999999998s)]
*  I have only for the man, the shower and the bathroom. [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=3212.44s)]
*  Some of those girls are pissed standing up. [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=3214.7599999999998s)]
*  I'll tell you. [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=3216.3599999999997s)]
*  Yeah, but I mean, we had women coming in and they watch us work out, but they couldn't [[00:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=3217.6400000000003s)]
*  train there until they got in a bigger space and then women were included in the whole [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=3221.32s)]
*  thing. [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=3226.28s)]
*  And so the federation was a little bit reluctant to do that. [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=3226.76s)]
*  And when we did the Miss Olympia and all of the girls really enjoyed that, that they [[00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=3230.6800000000003s)]
*  were able to go on stage to also compete with the muscles and all that stuff. [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=3236.2000000000003s)]
*  The federation then woke up and they said, okay, we're going to get involved in that [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=3241.48s)]
*  and we're going to go get them. [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=3245.72s)]
*  And since then, it has been booming and they've been doing not only bodybuilding competitions, [[00:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=3246.7599999999998s)]
*  but fitness competitions and beauty competition. [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=3252.2799999999997s)]
*  Does Arnold Classic have a women's division? [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=3255.48s)]
*  Oh, yeah, absolutely. [[00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=3257.3999999999996s)]
*  That's great. [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=3258.2799999999997s)]
*  I didn't know that. [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=3258.7599999999998s)]
*  Oh, wow. [[00:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=3259.8799999999997s)]
*  Look at these chocolate babies right here. [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=3260.3599999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=3264.04s)]
*  Everybody kind of gets chocolate here. [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=3264.4399999999996s)]
*  The tanned. [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=3267.24s)]
*  Now you have this tanning stuff. [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=3269.24s)]
*  Was it real tanning back then or was it? [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=3270.7599999999998s)]
*  No. [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=3273.24s)]
*  What was the key to the best tan? [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=3273.48s)]
*  The best tan? [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=3275.08s)]
*  We got the best tan that we could get. [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=3275.8s)]
*  So I would work out a lot of times outside in the weightlifting platform in Venice. [[00:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=3279.08s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=3284.04s)]
*  I love it. [[00:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=3284.52s)]
*  So you get kind of tanned all over the place. [[00:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=3285.08s)]
*  They're doing chin-ups and doing bench presses and incline and dips and all that stuff. [[00:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=3287.4s)]
*  Then we would jump in the ocean again, come back and work out some more and all this. [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=3291.64s)]
*  But in the end, we then added to that tan, tanning. [[00:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=3295.64s)]
*  Tan in a minute by Helena Rubenstein. [[00:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=3303.4s)]
*  So I don't even know if this exists anymore. [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=3307.8s)]
*  Bring it up tanning in a minute. [[00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=3310.36s)]
*  But 60 second sous-vay, they call it. [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=3312.36s)]
*  That was in those days. [[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=3316.36s)]
*  It was the big trick. [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=3317.96s)]
*  So you put it on with a sponge. [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=3319.32s)]
*  You know, you just poured it out on a little plate. [[00:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=3321.4s)]
*  You put it on with a sponge and you hit a body of yours. [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=3323.8s)]
*  They did your back and stuff. [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=3326.2000000000003s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=3327.48s)]
*  In the back of the thighs and all of that stuff. [[00:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=3327.7200000000003s)]
*  So this is what they did. [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=3330.04s)]
*  That's why a lot of guys. [[00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=3331.48s)]
*  They spray it on. [[00:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=3332.6s)]
*  They have actual experts come to the bodybuilding show and backstage, there's people that manufacture [[00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=3334.68s)]
*  this tanning stuff and they would then help bodybuilders and spray it on and all of that. [[00:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=3341.0s)]
*  So it's much more professional today. [[00:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=3345.4s)]
*  But at the time, so you would say they would put that tan in a can, basically. [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=3347.24s)]
*  They would put it in a bottle. [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=3351.48s)]
*  It was in a bottle. [[00:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=3352.68s)]
*  And you'd have a friend do your back. [[00:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=3353.64s)]
*  Would anybody ever sabotage somebody and not do their back really good? [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=3354.92s)]
*  No, but I mean, there were some people that were really stupid [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=3358.52s)]
*  and then did not know how to put it on. [[00:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=3361.72s)]
*  They would show kind of like streaks of the because they didn't have a little mulatto [[00:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=3363.72s)]
*  around the wrist. [[00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=3369.08s)]
*  So we put on just a light kind of layer. [[00:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=3370.12s)]
*  It was all about just a little subtle thing because it's not going to make you win. [[00:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=3373.0s)]
*  It just makes you the photos look a little bit better when you have a little bit of color. [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=3377.7999999999997s)]
*  And what was it called if somebody went too dark? [[00:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=3381.24s)]
*  Would you just call them a little chocolate bunny or something? [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=3383.16s)]
*  No, it was up to the individual. [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=3385.3199999999997s)]
*  So matter of fact, they tell you that you can see in our Arnold Classic a lot of times when [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=3388.04s)]
*  the guys turn around, you sometimes don't even know who is black and who is not. [[00:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=3394.76s)]
*  Because they're so dark now, the tanning is gone, so sophisticated. [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=3401.56s)]
*  Look at this guy. [[00:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=3405.88s)]
*  When he turns around, you would think it's a black guy standing. [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=3408.04s)]
*  For sure. [[00:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=3411.08s)]
*  And a nutmeg fella. [[00:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=3411.7200000000003s)]
*  Yeah, that is just a little molasses baby. [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=3413.64s)]
*  That's so remarkable. [[00:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=3418.36s)]
*  In business, they say you can have better, cheaper, or faster, but you only get to pick two. [[00:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=3420.36s)]
*  What if you could have all three at the same time? [[00:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=3427.32s)]
*  That's exactly what some of the world's most innovative brands and AI tech companies have [[00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=3429.8s)]
*  since they upgraded to the next generation of the cloud, Oracle Cloud Infrastructure. [[00:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=3435.8s)]
*  OCI is the blazing fast platform for your infrastructure, database, application development, [[00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=3441.48s)]

*  How is it faster? [[00:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=3459.56s)]
*  OCI's block storage gives you more operations per second. [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=3460.84s)]
*  Cheaper? [[00:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=3465.08s)]
*  OCI costs up to 50% less for compute, 70% less for storage, and 80% less for networking. [[00:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=3465.88s)]
*  Better? [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=3472.52s)]
*  In test after test, OCI customers report lower latency and higher bandwidth versus other clouds. [[00:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=3473.2400000000002s)]

*  Boom! [[01:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=3612.2s)]
*  I told you. [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=3618.4399999999996s)]
*  Back. [[01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=3620.2s)]
*  I want to talk about your new show. You do have some stuff just so we make sure we talk about it, man. [[01:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=3628.7599999999998s)]
*  FUBAR. I watched your first episode. So I guess it's not out yet, right? [[01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=3632.68s)]
*  No. [[01:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=3637.3999999999996s)]
*  And in season two, it's kind of great because it brings me through all this nostalgia of watching [[01:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=3638.86s)]
*  you over the years, right? I feel like it's a little bit of all the... To me, this is perception, [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=3643.1s)]
*  and it could be judgment, but a little bit of all your roles in the one. Did it feel like that a [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=3648.7000000000003s)]
*  little bit when you're shooting it? [[01:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=3652.38s)]
*  Well, the idea of the show is... Of course, when you act out, then you find those moments where [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=3654.2200000000003s)]
*  you can play all of the different roles. But the idea of the show is just to do what we did with [[01:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=3659.58s)]
*  True Lies, what Jim Cameron did with True Lies, right? So it was like, how do we go and do a show [[01:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=3665.74s)]
*  where you pack it with action and also with comedy, with humor, and also with kind of soap opera, [[01:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=3671.8999999999996s)]
*  where there's relationships, interesting relationships, and so on. And so I think that [[01:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=3679.18s)]
*  the writers did a really good job because just like in True Lies, I'm the number one spy in this [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=3684.06s)]
*  show. But when I come home, so I kick ass out there, I take care of the job all the time, [[01:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=3689.82s)]
*  wipe out the enemy, all the terrorists, all this stuff. But when I come home, I have to deal with [[01:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=3696.2200000000003s)]
*  the everyday crap, right? Like we all do, right? You have to worry about the kids, the wife is mad [[01:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=3701.42s)]
*  at you because you were gone for a week again, and you couldn't really explain. I always, because my [[01:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=3709.02s)]
*  wife does not know that I'm a spy, so I always have to lie and have to have this equipment company, [[01:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=3715.1s)]
*  and there's a health convention there, they have to go to this convention. Then I come home and [[01:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=3721.42s)]
*  have to make up stories. They say, this sales guy is really interesting. I tried to sell my equipment [[01:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=3725.98s)]
*  there and over there talked about his life cycles. All of a sudden they say, I was so upset about [[01:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=3730.62s)]
*  this whole, and so you just make up all these stories. But I'm getting, there's a divorce [[01:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=3734.86s)]
*  there, then my daughter, all of a sudden is in the CIA, and then she's also a spy, and all of this stuff. [[01:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=3742.54s)]
*  So there's all these conflicts that are going on, and it makes it a really interesting show [[01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=3749.42s)]
*  then to watch because it's relationships, it's action, it's funny and all that. And so last show [[01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=3753.6600000000003s)]
*  did very well, the last series, and now they did the second season, and so now we see how that is doing. [[01:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=3759.5800000000004s)]
*  Yeah, I think there's like a level of also nostalgia just getting to see you still [[01:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=3765.42s)]
*  operate in these roles. You've continued to keep your, I mean, you just continue to want to work, [[01:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=3769.34s)]
*  because you don't have to work anymore. Well, let me tell you something. I love to work. [[01:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=3777.7400000000002s)]
*  Why? Because it makes you active. I just think the most important thing is as we get older, [[01:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=3786.7000000000003s)]
*  you don't have to worry about anything right now, but eventually you will. When you get older, [[01:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=3793.42s)]
*  you have a tendency of sitting around. You have a tendency of not moving as much, and so it forces [[01:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=3799.9s)]
*  you. So when you do a movie, you have to get up at six in the morning, you have to get to the set, [[01:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=3807.26s)]
*  you have to go and prep, you have to go and practice the action and all that stuff in the [[01:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=3812.94s)]
*  fight scenes, you have to do the rehearsals of the scenes, and you work until night. Then you go home [[01:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=3817.34s)]
*  and you fall bed tired, and then you get up again in the morning. So, and remember the most important [[01:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=3822.78s)]
*  thing for your brain is to go and practice and to kind of do challenging things with your brain, [[01:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=3828.54s)]
*  so you don't get Alzheimer's and other kind of diseases like that. So it makes you memorize [[01:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=3835.74s)]
*  lines, long scenes, and especially in TV, you do like six to eight or 10 pages a day. [[01:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=3841.34s)]
*  Oh, just keeping your brain active. [[01:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=3847.1s)]
*  So you bring it around, and then I play chess on the side while I'm waiting for the scenes and [[01:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=3848.22s)]
*  all this. Just keep always going. So to me, the important thing is because I feel like [[01:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=3852.86s)]
*  if you rest, you rust. And so it's all about movement. It's all about keep moving and keep [[01:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=3857.58s)]
*  moving and keep challenging yourself because as soon as we retire, you know, things go south. [[01:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=3863.82s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, there's just something that happens. [[01:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=3869.6600000000003s)]
*  Well, especially Alzheimer's. Especially, it's Alzheimer's, Schwarzenegger, Alzheimer's, [[01:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=3871.02s)]
*  they almost seem like they would be neighbor, you know what I'm saying? Like no judgment or [[01:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=3876.7000000000003s)]
*  anything, but it almost seems like that would be the one that would look for you because of just [[01:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=3879.82s)]
*  same letters, some of the same letters even. [[01:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=3884.7000000000003s)]
*  I have enough with my heart problem. So I don't have to worry about another problem forever. [[01:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=3886.78s)]
*  The last 25 years, I had heart open mouth surgery three times and all that kind of stuff [[01:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=3893.6600000000003s)]
*  and valve replacements and all that stuff. It's a congenital thing from my mother. She had it from [[01:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=3899.1s)]
*  her mother and all that stuff. And so I have to deal with that all the time. But everything is [[01:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=3904.7000000000003s)]
*  good because I train every day and I exercise and I watch what I eat, which is I watch the food and [[01:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=3909.74s)]
*  then I eat it. Did you ever have a stroke and you just kind of, you're like, I've kind of had that [[01:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=3915.1s)]
*  before I can get through the rest of the day? No, no, none of that. [[01:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=3918.22s)]
*  You know what I'm talking about though? Yeah. [[01:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=3922.3799999999997s)]
*  Like did you ever have like, because sometimes you'll get a pain or something and you're like, [[01:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=3923.74s)]
*  I think I'm okay. Did you ever have like, I'm assuming if you had a lifetime of like having [[01:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=3927.3399999999997s)]
*  heart issues that you would start to be like, ah, that's going to be okay. [[01:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=3932.22s)]
*  I was kind of in front of the situation. So that means that I remember when I took my mother [[01:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=3935.5s)]
*  to the hospital here when she was here visiting, she always had an episode and I took her to UCLA. [[01:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=3941.26s)]
*  That's when we found out that she had a valve problem. And the doctor then said to me, he says, [[01:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=3947.98s)]
*  make sure that you also check yourself. He says, because this is something, there's a genetic thing. [[01:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=3953.02s)]
*  So it was almost like a gift that she got to be here and you got to go through that with her. [[01:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=3958.94s)]
*  Exactly. So, so I, from that point on always went with the doctor and the doctor said to me, [[01:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=3961.9s)]
*  says, well, you have, you know, at one point he said, you have a problem with your valve, [[01:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=3966.54s)]
*  with the aortic valve and you don't have to do anything now. He says, but as soon as we see it [[01:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=3971.6600000000003s)]
*  going down, we want to catch it before it goes down because otherwise it affects the water itself [[01:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=3977.7400000000002s)]
*  and blah, blah, blah. So the bottom line is I stayed on top of it and always. So when I got my [[01:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=3983.1000000000004s)]
*  surgery, open mouth surgery, I went in there because I made an appointment. So there was no [[01:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=3988.86s)]
*  episode, there was no stroke, there was no heart attack or anything. Never had any of those kind [[01:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=3992.94s)]
*  of things. So I always was ahead of the game. Was it scary when they put you under? Like, [[01:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=3996.86s)]
*  were you kind of scared? Did you make sure it was the best guy doing it, Arnold? [[01:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=4000.7000000000003s)]
*  Of course, it's important. Did you look him in the eyes and take him off the side and say, [[01:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=4005.5s)]
*  let's make sure we do it good? No, I didn't have to do that. Now I think I would do that for sure. [[01:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=4009.1s)]
*  I knew this guy's history. Dr. Starnes was his name. They did the first two surgeries [[01:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=4014.14s)]
*  and he was like the top of the top. So there was no do is about it. [[01:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=4020.3799999999997s)]
*  You've had a very blessed and interesting life, right? It's been, you know, and you've had it. [[01:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=4027.98s)]
*  So, you know, at what point you're probably, I would say, I think it's fair to say you're [[01:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=4033.3399999999997s)]
*  probably in the second half of your life. At what point do you like, do kind of like goals turn into [[01:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=4037.58s)]
*  like legacy? If in your mind at all, if it does. And I don't mean that to be an uncomfortable [[01:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=4044.94s)]
*  question. I'm just like, does your brain start to adjust where like these are my goals? And then [[01:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=4050.54s)]
*  like, okay, this is a legacy that I want to leave. Does that make any sense or no? [[01:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=4054.2999999999997s)]
*  Well, I think it is always important to think about, you know, the idea of that we should [[01:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=4058.86s)]
*  leave the world a better place than we inherited it. And so I, my whole life was always about, [[01:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=4068.06s)]
*  okay, how can I make this a better world of the knowledge that I have? So for instance, [[01:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=4074.86s)]
*  in fitness, in bodybuilding, I went around the world to promote the idea of weightlifting and [[01:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=4080.46s)]
*  training and resistance training. Oh, yeah. And made it then popular, right? Because we had to [[01:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=4085.98s)]
*  figure out a way of penetrating through the general public that thought that bodybuilding is just, [[01:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=4090.94s)]
*  you know, flexing your muscles on stage. But they didn't realize that bodybuilding is [[01:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=4095.98s)]
*  something that you just get a healthy and stronger body for whatever you do. You maybe [[01:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=4101.9s)]
*  need it for tennis. You maybe need it for your bicycling. You maybe need it for your [[01:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=4106.139999999999s)]
*  whatever sport, you know, like UFC fighters are working. Oh, the first time I heard of fitness was [[01:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=4111.18s)]
*  through you. Yeah, it was through you. But I mean, that was the idea is I wanted to not just [[01:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=4115.34s)]
*  lift myself up, but I wanted to lift the rest of the bodybuilding movement up. And so it was always [[01:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=4119.26s)]
*  something. So now, of course, 50 years later, there's a gymnasium in every hotel in the world. [[01:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=4125.18s)]
*  There is a gymnasium or weight room in every kind of a military installation of base. There's those [[01:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=4131.5s)]
*  guys we saw there doing those curls with the cement. There's everything. Exactly. So people [[01:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=4138.22s)]
*  are lifting weights everywhere. Every high school, every college, every sports team, [[01:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=4142.14s)]
*  everyone has weight rooms. Yeah. So this is where we are now. That's why I felt really proud of that. [[01:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=4147.58s)]
*  That we were able with the help of Jane Fonda and other kind of characters that were, you know, [[01:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=4153.660000000001s)]
*  helping women with the fitness movement. And so we really elevated the fitness sport to something [[01:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=4159.1s)]
*  really also a huge economic, you know, contribution that it made. So to me, that's important. When I [[01:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=4165.1s)]
*  became governor, I wanted to make sure that we have healthcare for everybody. I want to make sure [[01:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=4171.9s)]
*  that we have a clean environment, that we fight pollution and to pass laws to reduce the pollution [[01:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=4176.139999999999s)]
*  in California by 25% and all that. So I continued on creating an environmental organization and to [[01:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=4182.219999999999s)]
*  have our world summit in Vienna every year where all the environmentalists come together and talk [[01:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=4188.86s)]
*  about how do we go and fight pollution and all that stuff. So we have one coming up in 14 days [[01:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=4195.58s)]
*  now again. And so it's always after school programs, for instance, when I realized that our kids, [[01:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=4200.78s)]
*  that, you know, 70% of the kids come from a home where both of the parents are working. [[01:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=4207.58s)]
*  So there's no way they're picking them up after three o'clock from the school. So there's kids [[01:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=4213.82s)]
*  standing around after school and not doing anything. So then I found out where this is [[01:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=4217.98s)]
*  the danger zone for kids between three and six o'clock because there's no supervision. So they [[01:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=4222.54s)]
*  get involved with drugs, with gangs, with violence, with alcohol, teenage pregnancy. [[01:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=4227.74s)]
*  Oh yeah. I said this costs the community a lot of money. Let's do something about it. [[01:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=4232.46s)]
*  Everyone was complaining about it, but they weren't doing anything about it. So I stepped out and [[01:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=4236.219999999999s)]
*  started the after school programs. And it has been a huge hit. We've raised over the last 30 years. [[01:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=4240.62s)]
*  Are they still open? The program just started? $1.5 billion we raised. Oh really? How much was it? [[01:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=4246.62s)]
*  All over the country. We have been to millions and millions of kids. We've helped with after [[01:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=4250.78s)]
*  school programs, with great success rates and all of this stuff. So to me it's all about how [[01:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=4255.42s)]
*  can I make this a better world? I see what you're saying. So you feel like a lot of your legacy has [[01:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=4260.22s)]
*  kind of been lived along the way. Exactly. It's not like I want this. It should be my legacy. [[01:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=4263.9800000000005s)]
*  I don't think that way, but I think about I want to improve the world, especially now. But I mean, [[01:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=4268.38s)]
*  think about it. I'm an immigrant. I'm an immigrant that came over here and got every opportunity [[01:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=4274.22s)]
*  in the world because of America. America gave me everything. They gave me the money that they have [[01:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=4282.22s)]
*  made, the career in bodybuilding, the career in acting, the wonderful family. All of that stuff [[01:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=4288.38s)]
*  is because of America. So to me it's a natural thing that they give something back to America. [[01:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=4294.94s)]
*  You're one of the most jacked immigrants too that we've ever had probably, I think. For sure. [[01:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=4300.139999999999s)]
*  I hope so. Yeah, you do. And you're competitive about it. I love that I can feel how competitive [[01:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=4304.38s)]
*  you are. And that's great. You have to be competitive because also America is a platform [[01:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=4310.46s)]
*  for if you are competitive and if you choose to apply yourself that you can reach some of your [[01:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=4314.7s)]
*  dreams and goals and aspirations. Do you think that it's still possible? Like you've had this, [[01:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=4321.34s)]
*  you've gotten to live in America for a while now and have a good breadth of understanding here. [[01:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=4326.06s)]
*  You've gotten to work in politics. Do you think the American dream is still possible [[01:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=4330.14s)]
*  or do you think there's things happening these days that are where we're not helping that along? [[01:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=4334.38s)]
*  Well, I can tell you I didn't study this issue, right? So I couldn't really give you facts and [[01:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=4340.62s)]
*  figures. But what I can tell you is no matter where I go in the world today, people come up to me and [[01:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=4347.66s)]
*  say, Arnold, can you please help me get to America? So that never has changed. It doesn't matter to [[01:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=4355.42s)]
*  immigrants. People that want to come here, they don't know what the political situation, they [[01:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=4363.5s)]
*  don't care if the Democrats are in power or Republicans in power, what the Senate says, [[01:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=4368.62s)]
*  what the Congress says, what the governor says. Nothing. They just want to come over here. They [[01:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=4373.099999999999s)]
*  want to get a shot. So this is what it is and if they do it the legal way. So that is the key [[01:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=4377.34s)]
*  thing to me is to do it the legal way. So anyway, the bottom line is I think the opportunities are [[01:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=4383.34s)]
*  there. When I go down to Gold's Gym, I see this guy from Africa that was competing in my bodybuilding [[01:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=4388.22s)]
*  shows in the Arnold Classic and was in one of the top three. Then he became a personal trainer. [[01:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=4395.9s)]
*  He's charging $200 an hour. He's driving up one day with his blue Bentley. The next day he's [[01:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=4405.259999999999s)]
*  driving up with his red Ferrari. I mean, this is a guy from Africa that came over here with nothing. [[01:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=4412.78s)]
*  So this is a young kid, he's like maybe 35 or 40 years old and look at what he does. So there's [[01:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=4420.06s)]
*  trainers down there that are from different countries. There's people, if you're willing to [[01:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=4426.38s)]
*  work, that's why I always say to people, work your ass off. Don't ever come, this is my big [[01:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=4430.860000000001s)]
*  advice to the immigrants, I said don't ever come over here to just use this country. I said give [[01:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=4436.7s)]
*  something back. Think about that you want to work your ass off here, you want to educate yourself [[01:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=4443.18s)]
*  here, you want to contribute to America here. That's what you want to do because the very fact [[01:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=4448.78s)]
*  that you're allowed to come over here, you should go and have that mentality of wanting to give [[01:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=4453.179999999999s)]
*  something back. That's the bottom line. Amen, man. And I think that goes to it, even as you're saying [[01:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=4458.54s)]
*  that, Arnold, it's making me think about like even our relationships that I'm in or business [[01:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=4463.179999999999s)]
*  situations. I should think of most things as that way. Like let me give something to this, right? [[01:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=4467.42s)]
*  Whatever this is, if this is a relationship with a spouse or a girlfriend or a boyfriend or [[01:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=4472.86s)]
*  if it's a team that I'm on or just a commitment I've had, I'm going to spend an hour with my son [[01:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=4477.66s)]
*  or my mom to do something. Let me give something to this, right? Let me not just take even this [[01:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=4482.38s)]
*  moment for granted, whatever it is, let me be here and be present and apply myself so that we create [[01:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=4488.46s)]
*  something that just so I'm honoring the fact that I even have this moment in time. Yes, and let me [[01:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=4495.179999999999s)]
*  tell you something, that as soon as people realize that they're not self-made, that there were a lot [[01:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=4501.18s)]
*  of people involved in where you are today, a lot of people, you couldn't operate without the engineer, [[01:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=4509.1s)]
*  you couldn't operate without the deal that you got to do this and blah blah blah and all this kind [[01:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=4517.34s)]
*  of stuff. You have to recognize that because when you recognize that you're not self-made, [[01:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=4521.58s)]
*  people have helped you, that is what makes you think click and say I got to now help other people. [[01:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=4526.78s)]
*  I have the responsibility to help other people and then you realize how much joy it brings you [[01:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=4533.26s)]
*  when you see that you have an impact and you can help other people. That's why we have the Pump [[01:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=4539.1s)]
*  Club and that's why we do the Arnold Classic and the promotion of bodybuilding and environmental [[01:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=4543.5s)]
*  stuff and the after-school programs. I mean to go to one of these after-school programs, [[01:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=4548.62s)]
*  conventions and to hear the kids' stories, it just makes you feel so good that you did that, [[01:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=4553.26s)]
*  that you raised the money. We have poker tournaments at my house where we raise like [[01:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=4560.620000000001s)]

*  So this is where the action is and you can do all of that because as I always say the day is 24 [[01:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=4569.02s)]
*  hours and I talk about it at great length in my book, you know, be useful. I talk about all of [[01:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=4574.46s)]

*  that everyone has to go out and work the energy they left the house in the morning and they came [[01:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=4884.9400000000005s)]

*  and then when it became governor and I think that contributed to me becoming governor because [[01:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=5134.7s)]
*  I saw this whole idea that I want to be environmentally friendly I want to reduce [[01:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=5139.42s)]
*  greenhouse gases I want to get the environment that renewable energy up in California and all [[01:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=5143.66s)]
*  this stuff so thanks to become governor he becomes now Terry Tamanin becomes the head of the EPA [[01:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=5148.86s)]
*  and all of this but this all happened in my knowledge about the environment all this happened [[01:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=5155.259999999999s)]
*  because of Bobby Kennedy so that's the kind of a guy he is I mean he's like didn't say oh you're [[01:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=5161.179999999999s)]

*  and he did wish me good luck and he wanted me to win not because I'm a Republican that he just [[01:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=5172.62s)]
*  like oh I like Arnold I want the good guy to win no matter what side he's on exactly so that's the [[01:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=5179.099999999999s)]
*  kind of a guy Bobby is you know so I'm I think the world of him yeah he's cool we had him on the [[01:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=5184.46s)]
*  podcast when everybody was thinking he was kind of crazy during the pandemic and stuff and he was [[01:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=5189.5s)]
*  concerned about just people's health and well-being with vaccines and stuff we had him on and um but [[01:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=5193.099999999999s)]
*  yeah I've always known him to be just a neat guy you know he's my friend um yeah I'm excited for [[01:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=5199.0199999999995s)]
*  him I'm curious to see what it's like once you get into office how can you still keep your beliefs [[01:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=5204.3s)]
*  or not or do things get heavily compromised do you feel like it is compromised you have to you have [[01:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=5209.34s)]
*  to come because because the whole world doesn't think exactly like you remember what Eisenhower [[01:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=5215.580000000001s)]
*  said Eisenhower said that politics is like the road the left the right is the gutter and the center [[01:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=5221.18s)]
*  is drivable and that's exactly the way it is in politics you have to understand that there's a [[01:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=5229.26s)]
*  sweet spot you know like the teaching golf hit the sweet spot going tennis to hit the sweet spot [[01:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=5234.860000000001s)]
*  notice there's a sweet spot to find exactly so you can get a deal made and then you can move [[01:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=5240.22s)]
*  things forward it's not exactly your way I mean I remember with the infrastructure I wanted to build [[01:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=5245.42s)]
*  100 billion dollars worth of infrastructure but they only agreed on and they're on 60 billion [[01:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=5250.62s)]
*  dollars so I didn't get my way with the financial situation I wanted to wipe out the deficit and I [[01:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=5256.38s)]
*  was not able to do that with all these democrats around it they love to spend money so I was stuck [[01:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=5263.1s)]
*  with it so but the fact of the matter is we could improve the situation and I was able to work [[01:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=5269.82s)]
*  together with the democrats on environmental issues and infrastructure issues and so many other [[01:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=5274.78s)]
*  healthcare issues so many other issues education and all of this stuff and we did really fine it [[01:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=5279.66s)]
*  had a great time up there being governor of the state of California but it's about compromise I [[01:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=5285.0199999999995s)]
*  mean you've said before that you can't do everything you can't do it all by yourself right it's not a [[01:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=5289.179999999999s)]
*  dictatorship you know so you have two parties you've ever in within your own party they think [[01:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=5293.099999999999s)]
*  differently so that's you have to face reality the trick is just to be do not hate the other side [[01:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=5297.82s)]
*  because they think differently it's just kind of like figuring out how can we work together and how [[01:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=5305.9s)]
*  can we do something that's really good for the people that's the bottom line they just had do [[01:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=5311.42s)]
*  you think we'll ever have a republican governor again in California well you know if someone has [[01:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=5316.3s)]
*  a good program and if someone is organic I mean with me it was possible because I had a great [[01:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=5322.54s)]
*  mentor number one which was Pete Wilson who was a governor of California two terms and he helped [[01:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=5332.62s)]
*  Pete Wilson yeah Pete Wilson yeah and he helped me uh you know with the race a lot and then I also [[01:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=5338.62s)]
*  was organic because you know people saw that I did not come out of nowhere where I always had [[01:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=5346.38s)]
*  and went from acting to politics I mean I had I was working with Special Olympics for decades [[01:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=5352.78s)]

*  go to 40 million people you would know mathematically now you need 12 lane highways meaning six lanes and [[01:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=5655.66s)]
*  then on top of it you build another freeway right so you don't have traffic congestion but that's [[01:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=5662.38s)]
*  not what they did right then when you have to you know when you go from 20 to 40 million people [[01:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=5667.34s)]
*  then you need twice as many houses yeah you need twice as many apartment buildings you need twice [[01:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=5672.22s)]
*  as much of everything schools and everything they didn't they didn't take care of them because the [[01:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=5677.1s)]
*  environmentalists thought that if we say no growth then no one will come but in the meantime no one [[01:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7bOtwu4zY&t=5681.9800000000005s)]
