*  Well, they had a couple of issues in our area where they like it sprayed for bugs too many times. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azvkw4T_8bc&t=181.0s)]
*  And so in the four coming decades, you had a lot of little Nicky's running around. Yeah. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azvkw4T_8bc&t=185.0s)]
*  But at Halloween after that film had come out, everybody was little Nicky. Yeah, I love little Nicky, by the way. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azvkw4T_8bc&t=191.0s)]
*  Yeah, like such a great movie. But it's like, yeah, there were a lot of like copycats where people you couldn't tell if they were challenged. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azvkw4T_8bc&t=198.0s)]
*  Yeah. Or they were from the devil. Yeah. Yeah. And you grew up in Northland. Yeah. Yeah. You know. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azvkw4T_8bc&t=207.0s)]

*  Little Dicky's. Yeah. A lot of little Nicky's. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azvkw4T_8bc&t=220.0s)]
*  Suck off. One of my favorite moments I was going to tell you this. I don't know if I ever did. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azvkw4T_8bc&t=227.0s)]
*  Move this over here a little. Let's know this way. Like push it out. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azvkw4T_8bc&t=231.0s)]
*  Okay. Right. Here we go. Me. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azvkw4T_8bc&t=236.0s)]
*  So, so back in New Orleans, the first time I was there, I was like 19 years old. You were? Yeah. What is this? Huh? [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azvkw4T_8bc&t=243.0s)]
*  What's this fucking avatar? Well, we have a production of this. I don't know. It likes you though. I know it's that. Okay. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azvkw4T_8bc&t=252.0s)]
*  Well, I'm into Black Dick now. Well, it's okay. It's that. It's also a... Black Dick me off. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azvkw4T_8bc&t=258.0s)]
*  I wonder if there is. Yeah. Like Black Dick is, is it a seasonal thing? I don't know any. I haven't ever done it. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azvkw4T_8bc&t=265.0s)]
*  We don't know yet. Yeah. But it is a valid question because it's like Black Dick season. What would it be? Christmas? [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azvkw4T_8bc&t=271.0s)]
*  No. Halloween? Possibly. Yeah. Maybe Easter. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azvkw4T_8bc&t=279.0s)]
*  Ooh, Easter. Springtime. Or Black History Month. Hmm. I mean, I think that'd be apropos. Yeah, maybe. We should suck them all off. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azvkw4T_8bc&t=288.0s)]
*  I'm not doing it. I'll support anybody. I will pat somebody in the back while they do it. I'll do it. Is that? Yep. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azvkw4T_8bc&t=299.0s)]
*  Is that appropriate if you... Yeah, like how, yeah, like how do you be supportive of your gay friends? I guess sometimes like... [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azvkw4T_8bc&t=306.0s)]
*  You don't pat somebody in the back if they're BJing somebody, do you? That's not, that's being weird, right? That's not being supportive, I guess. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azvkw4T_8bc&t=313.0s)]
*  I think that's being supportive. I think you're wrong on that. Okay. I think you're like, okay, you know what? You go, Gary. Yeah. Yeah. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azvkw4T_8bc&t=320.0s)]
*  You get it, Gary. Praise him. Get it, Gary. Carrot top. Guzzle, guzzle, guzzle, buddy. Yeah. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azvkw4T_8bc&t=328.0s)]
*  You play a little kazoo. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azvkw4T_8bc&t=335.0s)]
*  Jizzle, jizzle, jizzle. Yeah, you play the fucking jizz flute. Jizzle bells. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azvkw4T_8bc&t=337.0s)]
*  Why aren't... That's why I said Christmas. I think we're there now. Jizzle bells. Deck the balls with balls of cocky. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azvkw4T_8bc&t=343.0s)]
*  So nice. Oh, Nick Swarton. Yeah, I'm back. Good to see you, dude. He's my fucking dude. Love you very much. Love you too, man. Missed you. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azvkw4T_8bc&t=353.0s)]
*  I'll tell you my New Orleans story really quick. When I was first there, and this, like, as somebody that drinks, the drunkest I've ever been, New Orleans, and I call it Le Barf, where I walked down Bourbon Street and I threw up into my hands. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azvkw4T_8bc&t=360.0s)]
*  No reason why I did that. Hands like this? Yep. Praise. And I vomited and then threw it in the air. And I've never done that before, since. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azvkw4T_8bc&t=377.0s)]
*  But like, 19, 20 years old, I was like, yeah, this sounds like... And like, when LeBron throws powder, you know, before the game, but I threw barf and I was like, and I call it the Le Barf. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azvkw4T_8bc&t=387.0s)]
*  I don't recommend it, but you know, you've been down there. Who dat? Who dat? [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azvkw4T_8bc&t=399.0s)]
*  Oh, I've seen it, bro. Well, a lot of times, if you... Yeah, and you can even... There's a couple brothers down there, you give them a couple dollars, he'll backflip right through the vomit away. There's a lot of, like, there's backflipping brothers will roll up on you there. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azvkw4T_8bc&t=404.0s)]
*  A backflip vomit? Give me three dollars, I'll fucking backflip through a... Yeah, what up, motherfucker? Yeah, through a vomit or a stream or through some asbestos or something. Yeah. They got those hard hitters down there. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azvkw4T_8bc&t=416.0s)]
*  Yeah, game on. Asbestos fucking shots? Yeah. Good God. Asbestos bombs. Shots, shots, shots, shots. It's just... Don't do it. They're just playing that? Don't do it. At like Chinese construction sites? [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azvkw4T_8bc&t=427.0s)]
*  Yeah, of course. Shots, shots, shots, shots, shots, shots. Yeah, and then everyone's dead. Everybody, everybody suck me up. Suck me. Suck me up. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azvkw4T_8bc&t=440.0s)]
*  The thing I wanted to tell you, I'm really bummed out about it. Just let me just vent, please. Okay. I thought of a movie and it was already made. Oh, yeah. And it was a movie for us. And I thought it was like in the vein of Chardonnay-do or whatever the fuck. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azvkw4T_8bc&t=452.0s)]
*  Chardonnay-do? Yeah. That's not that wives thing where it's a big glass of wine chasing them or whatever. I mean, it could be. But I thought of a movie called Llamageddon. And it was you and me Armageddon with llamas. And it's already been made. And I was really bummed out because I tried to find the spelling today. And they were like, yeah, that movie has been made. And I'm like, me and Theo, Llamageddon, kill Spade off immediately. David Spade done early. First Spade fucking made. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azvkw4T_8bc&t=468.0s)]
*  It's easy to also need to just sit him on a chair that is a centimeter uneven. And his spine is a centimeter uneven. A couple phone books. He brings his own chair. Yeah, he does. People don't know that, by the way. David Spade. God bless him. Rest in peace. Yeah, that part. Yeah, he passed. But he has a bad spine. BYOC, dude. That dude will bring his own fucking chair anywhere. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azvkw4T_8bc&t=498.0s)]
*  And the problem here is what it is. The chair doesn't match the other chairs. That's the problem. It doesn't match at all. He has like a metal folding chair. It's like a cafeteria chair from the war or something. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azvkw4T_8bc&t=526.0s)]
*  It looks like the roaring 20s or like something like. Yeah, we don't. Yeah, it looks horrifying, but it suits his back. There he is right there looking at him with his own chair. Oh my God. Go to my chair. What a gypsy. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azvkw4T_8bc&t=536.0s)]
*  Oh, go to my chair in that shot. Just show me. Look at my chair. That is Joe Derrick. Regular chair and he brings his fucking homemade chair. Dude, it's something he made it like church camp or something he said. Yeah, I think it was like in like a petting zoo or something. What are you going to do? The guy's a petting zoo. The guy's a BLM activist, you know? Yeah, we praise him. Oh, we praise him. Good to see you, dude. That was the drunkest you'd ever been there. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azvkw4T_8bc&t=553.0s)]
*  In New Orleans. That was the drunkest where I was like, I mean, I've never vomited into my hands and threw it in the air. Yeah, I don't even know what I was accomplishing there. Like what am I celebrating? Not dying? I think it's yeah. Like, you know, Nolens. Yeah. New Orleans. Yeah, Nolens, bro. They say Nolens, baby. And then somebody like, oh, we from New Orleans. And then they get like hardcore about it. We from New Orleans, bro. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azvkw4T_8bc&t=582.0s)]
*  And then you'll have somebody like, man, and they'll just give you an oyster and then shoot you in the head. And then they fucking fire hose your vomit. And they're like, all right. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azvkw4T_8bc&t=612.0s)]
*  All right. Litter on a bag. Eat my swamp pussy lips. The crazy thing about New Orleans is like, if you if something bad happens to you during a during like Mardi Gras or in a parade or if you have a stroke or have a child or something, you are both whatever you're doing. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azvkw4T_8bc&t=624.0s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. A child that has a stroke. Yeah. Whatever. Whatever. You're going through it yourself. An ambulance cannot get to you. So you are fucking you're fucking dead. You are either dead or somebody's alive. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azvkw4T_8bc&t=643.0s)]
*  It's like it depends on if you're having the stroke or the child. But yeah, just like people, they'll start digging a grave. They're like, we can't even the ambulance is like 40 blocks away. Yeah, they're like, yeah, you're gone. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azvkw4T_8bc&t=658.0s)]
*  Say goodbye to your aunt. Well, I went on down your aunt. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azvkw4T_8bc&t=670.0s)]
*  You're like, I've got two abortions. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azvkw4T_8bc&t=673.0s)]
*  The hurricane. Bye bye bye. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azvkw4T_8bc&t=679.0s)]
*  And they're like, damn, the water doesn't work here. No shit. First of all, you were eight feet below sea level. The water was never supposed to work. It was never supposed to work. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azvkw4T_8bc&t=684.0s)]
*  I remember one of my favorite times I was at like fucking Jazz Fest or some nonsense, which is awesome. Yeah, Jazz Fest is awesome. But there was a police horse. I don't know if I ever told you this. There was a police horse and the horse had diarrhea on the wall of a hotel right off Bourbon Street. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azvkw4T_8bc&t=696.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah. Diarrhea on the wall. So I thought this long time ago, I thought it'd be appropriate to pull my pants down and pretend like I diarrhea. So I pulled in front of the cop. Oh, yeah. Shit tricks. Yeah. Shit tricks. You fucking know, man. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azvkw4T_8bc&t=715.0s)]
*  So I pulled down a shit trick and the cop. I remember my friend at a Polaroid. That's how back far back it was. Took a shot of me. Diarrhea on the horse wall. And the cop just looked at me and he just went, no, no. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azvkw4T_8bc&t=732.0s)]
*  And I'm like, yeah, but it's funny, right? He's like, yeah, I get it. Just fucking move along, man. It's just like, patient zero. It's like, no, I'm not. Move along. I'm not entertaining this. I'm not. He didn't arrest me. Thank fucking God. But it was just like, yeah, that's not your diarrhea. Yeah, that's a horse. Yeah, you're copying his diarrhea. Yeah, that's copywritten basically, too, as well. I think it's just shotty written. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azvkw4T_8bc&t=749.0s)]
*  The craziest thing is that's New Orleans. You'll be eating in a fine dining restaurant and then a horse just bowel blasts. Fucking one of the pains of window glass out because everybody right outside of the restaurant is just drinking hand grenades, drinking each other's blood. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azvkw4T_8bc&t=780.0s)]
*  Yeah, they're having caviar and then all of a sudden fucking splatty comes out the fucking window. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azvkw4T_8bc&t=797.0s)]
*  Oh, man. Can you praise him? The baby God. And he's with us. What was I going to fucking say to you? Good to see you, dude. I love you. I had a series of times in New Orleans I would get drunk and go. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azvkw4T_8bc&t=803.0s)]
*  Me and my friend would go, we would get too drunk and then we would just go start. We'd get under like one of the overpasses of the bridge there and we'd start vomiting together. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azvkw4T_8bc&t=829.0s)]
*  But in between vomits, we would like just dab each other on New Orleans in between vomiting like we would because we would go through profuse bouts of vomiting because like, you know, some of the alcohol, it's just like they made it at home. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azvkw4T_8bc&t=839.0s)]
*  Some of the alcohol is like, right. New Orleans is it's like hair filtered, like hair filtered pubic hair. It's pubics. It's pubics cubes. Yeah. Yeah. New Orleans is like it's one of the cities where I'm like horrified where I'm like, oh God, like what? [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azvkw4T_8bc&t=852.0s)]
*  Like Vegas I can deal with fine, but there's certain cities where I'm like, oh God, how is this going to fucking play out? Yeah. You know what I mean? Where they just pull you into their fucking magic fucking voodoo. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azvkw4T_8bc&t=872.0s)]
*  Well, it's a lot of big titties, a lot of gout, a lot of undiagnosed sunburn, a lot of mosquito bites, malaria, good food. Now that's one thing. Ebola. Yeah, some. Yeah. Quarter cup. Yeah. Maybe a shot. Quarter cup. But it's one of those cities where there's just so much going on. But there's music going on. You know? [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azvkw4T_8bc&t=885.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's the thing. It's like the bar in Star Wars where it's like, oh, yeah, I can drink a vase of alcohol. It's not even like casual drinking.

You know what I'm talking about? Right. I get it. But it's like they could invite them. Yeah. Maybe just have a margarita. Yeah. And enjoy your life. Wham. Yeah.

*  Or young Filipino woman who has tagged. [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azvkw4T_8bc&t=2762.6800000000003s)]

*  And they put a sketch in this. [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azvkw4T_8bc&t=2769.44s)]
*  And it's kind of calling him out I guess. [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azvkw4T_8bc&t=2770.68s)]
*  And they put a heartbroken emoji right. [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azvkw4T_8bc&t=2772.68s)]
*  So first of all what does it mean. [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azvkw4T_8bc&t=2775.08s)]
*  Why was he why are you not a fan now. [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azvkw4T_8bc&t=2777.28s)]
*  He didn't have to he doesn't owe you that like he had to tell you. [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azvkw4T_8bc&t=2780.28s)]
*  That he had gay activity or he had only fans. [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azvkw4T_8bc&t=2783.48s)]

*  Or it might just be a noun but it's missing. [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azvkw4T_8bc&t=2808.2799999999997s)]
*  That doesn't. [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azvkw4T_8bc&t=2809.7599999999998s)]

*  It means an adverb. [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azvkw4T_8bc&t=2813.04s)]
*  Then. [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azvkw4T_8bc&t=2814.6s)]
*  After that they came. [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azvkw4T_8bc&t=2816.72s)]
*  So far you would think they come to the defense of sketch. [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azvkw4T_8bc&t=2818.96s)]
*  Because they say go lose weight you fucking fat fuck. [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azvkw4T_8bc&t=2822.2799999999997s)]

*  So they go back to the hotel and she starts getting like super belligerent [[01:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azvkw4T_8bc&t=5027.34s)]

*  The girl handcuffs the guy to a bed, starts giving him like a BJ [[01:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azvkw4T_8bc&t=5066.54s)]
*  and she passes out. [[01:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azvkw4T_8bc&t=5072.860000000001s)]

*  And he turns around and says just joking across the bat. [[01:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azvkw4T_8bc&t=5768.64s)]
*  It's like, oh. [[01:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azvkw4T_8bc&t=5771.52s)]

*  The mentally challenged guy and they catch him. [[01:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azvkw4T_8bc&t=5782.639999999999s)]
*  They accuse him of being a child predator. [[01:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azvkw4T_8bc&t=5785.2s)]
*  And then they make him wear a shirt that said, [[01:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azvkw4T_8bc&t=5787.12s)]
*  I went to meet up with a child and all I got was this stupid shirt. [[01:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azvkw4T_8bc&t=5789.36s)]
