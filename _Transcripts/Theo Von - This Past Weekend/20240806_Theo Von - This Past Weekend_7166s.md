*  medium, large. So what is it? Does it feel, cause it almost looks like right there, like it's almost [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLFvJ7OvVP4&t=687.76s)]
*  like a guy, like you're a God over this little tree. It's like, that's what it looks like right [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLFvJ7OvVP4&t=692.24s)]
*  there. Cause I never realized how it looks like a whole big tree, just compact, huh? Yeah. That's [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLFvJ7OvVP4&t=696.72s)]
*  basically what it is. I mean, people go up into the mountains and they'll dig out, you know, 20, [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLFvJ7OvVP4&t=701.76s)]
*  30, 40, 50 year old trees and bring them back, cut them down, cut them all back and put them in a [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLFvJ7OvVP4&t=708.72s)]
*  small pot and just kind of start over. And that's years and years of work. Really? Yeah. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLFvJ7OvVP4&t=716.4s)]
*  So it takes a lot of work to get a bonsai to really grow? Yeah. To look, looking like that, [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLFvJ7OvVP4&t=723.28s)]
*  a lot of years. Wow. Yeah. So it's kind of, yeah, you're right. It's, it's a project and you're, [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLFvJ7OvVP4&t=729.4399999999999s)]
*  it's, it's, you're calling it Godlike, but like it's, you know, you're putting in a ton of love [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLFvJ7OvVP4&t=736.4s)]
*  and your time and everything into this tree that you're, you know, it's like a person almost. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLFvJ7OvVP4&t=744.96s)]
*  Oh yeah, I bet. So there's a lot, there's a lot more gratification from just it being a tree. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLFvJ7OvVP4&t=750.5600000000001s)]
*  Yeah. For me, like I just love all that, man. Really? I got like, I think I'm at around 43 [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLFvJ7OvVP4&t=757.9200000000001s)]
*  trees now. Like it's, I'm fucking obsessed. Damn. Yes. You're an addict really. Yeah, I'm an addict. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLFvJ7OvVP4&t=765.12s)]

*  Like when the sun goes down. Damn, bro. But most trees, people, that's the first thing people, [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLFvJ7OvVP4&t=778.4000000000001s)]
*  the mistake they make, you know, I don't know if you're driving around, you see the guy by the [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLFvJ7OvVP4&t=784.96s)]
*  side of the road in a van selling those little bonsais. You ever see that, that shit driving [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLFvJ7OvVP4&t=789.0400000000001s)]
*  to the beach or something? Oh yeah. If you're heading towards Malibu or something on PCH. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLFvJ7OvVP4&t=793.6800000000001s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. Well, people, the first thing people do is go like, oh yeah, I gotta get one. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLFvJ7OvVP4&t=796.88s)]
*  I want a bonsai. And they put it inside and they fucking, they kill all the trees. That's the dude. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLFvJ7OvVP4&t=803.12s)]
*  These are like, dude, these are junipers and pines and shit like that. They don't grow indoors. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLFvJ7OvVP4&t=814.32s)]
*  These guys don't tell people that. I mean, there's very few that will grow inside. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLFvJ7OvVP4&t=820.96s)]
*  Some of the ficus and, but that very few, most, most bonsai trees, specimens go outside. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLFvJ7OvVP4&t=825.9200000000001s)]
*  So it says right here, the practice of bonsai development incorporates a number of techniques, [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLFvJ7OvVP4&t=838.24s)]
*  either unique to bonzo or using other forms of cultivation. Like, so you trim the leaves, [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLFvJ7OvVP4&t=841.44s)]
*  like, yeah, what all of the things you do to them? Yeah. You, well, I mean, you're constantly pruning, [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLFvJ7OvVP4&t=846.32s)]
*  trimming, fertilizing, wiring. Like you take different gauge wire and you're telling the [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLFvJ7OvVP4&t=851.2s)]
*  branches where to go, you know, styling the tree all out with, it's, you know, you're, [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLFvJ7OvVP4&t=861.12s)]
*  you're sort of dictating how this thing's gonna, you know, your vision of how the tree [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLFvJ7OvVP4&t=870.4000000000001s)]
*  will, you know, look its best. And is there a certain time when you go do it, Tommy, or is [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLFvJ7OvVP4&t=876.88s)]
*  it just kind of like, you're like, you know, I'm feeling this would be something to do today. Like, [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLFvJ7OvVP4&t=882.64s)]
*  how much of a responsibility is it as an owner? It's daily, man. It's like, it's like, [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLFvJ7OvVP4&t=886.9599999999999s)]
*  it's like, it's just part of the program. I mean, I'll wake up and like, [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLFvJ7OvVP4&t=895.6s)]
*  like rip some coffees and cigarettes. And then I go out and talk to the trees and chill out for [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLFvJ7OvVP4&t=899.84s)]
*  a while. Get the day started right, man. Oh, for sure. You're a grower and a show-er, dude. That's [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLFvJ7OvVP4&t=907.9200000000001s)]
*  what's crazy, bro. I can't even believe that. Wow. That's fascinating. You'd love it, man. I [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLFvJ7OvVP4&t=915.6800000000001s)]
*  don't know if you like tripping out and just creating shit, but if you like trees and you like [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLFvJ7OvVP4&t=923.84s)]
*  creating. I love being creative. And the wild thing is once life gets busy, it's hard to be [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLFvJ7OvVP4&t=930.8000000000001s)]
*  as creative. It's hard to like do as much. It's hard to be as creative. I feel like. Did you ever [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLFvJ7OvVP4&t=936.96s)]
*  feel like that with touring and stuff? It's like, cause I can only imagine for you guys, I mean, [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLFvJ7OvVP4&t=941.2800000000001s)]
*  it seemed like it was kind of, once you like launched, it was just like a brush fire, huh? [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLFvJ7OvVP4&t=946.64s)]
*  With your band. Yeah. Yeah. Like, fuck man. Kind of nonstop. Yeah. Since, you know, I mean, [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLFvJ7OvVP4&t=956.24s)]
*  you're always fucking doing something. If you're not touring, you're in the studio making the music. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLFvJ7OvVP4&t=966.96s)]
*  If you're not making the music, you're taking a break to start a new record or the like, [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLFvJ7OvVP4&t=973.2s)]
*  you know, you're always doing shit. So. Was there choices? I don't know what the fuck I'm [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLFvJ7OvVP4&t=979.76s)]
*  getting at, but. It's all right. I don't even know what the fuck I'm talking about. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLFvJ7OvVP4&t=987.76s)]
*  It's okay, man. What's one of the hardest parts about being about success as a group? Did you [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLFvJ7OvVP4&t=991.5200000000001s)]
*  find kind of, cause success as an individual kind of like you have partners and you have teammates [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLFvJ7OvVP4&t=998.4s)]
*  and people that support you. But like as a group, it's like there's, it's almost like you divided by [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLFvJ7OvVP4&t=1003.52s)]
*  four. So, or like, or, you know, by how many people are in your band. So it's like, fuck, [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLFvJ7OvVP4&t=1008.48s)]
*  it just seems like it'd be so hard to navigate, to keep everything going, to maintain the success. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLFvJ7OvVP4&t=1013.52s)]
*  That, yeah, that's, um, you're, you're 100% right, man. Like anytime there's more people other than [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLFvJ7OvVP4&t=1019.36s)]
*  yourself involved balancing, you know, four, three other guys and making that work is really rare, [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLFvJ7OvVP4&t=1028.6399999999999s)]
*  man. Really, really rare and it's not easy. And somehow we've managed to fucking keep it together. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLFvJ7OvVP4&t=1038.24s)]
*  Like there's only, there's only a handful of bands that, uh, that are, that are still doing it. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLFvJ7OvVP4&t=1047.28s)]
*  Oh, yeah. Shit, all of our, our peers just fell off here, fell off there. And like, [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLFvJ7OvVP4&t=1055.44s)]
*  that's what I was saying. I'm like, just really grateful because it, uh, that's kind of shit [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLFvJ7OvVP4&t=1062.24s)]
*  doesn't really happen all the time. I don't really know how to explain it. I'm just, [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLFvJ7OvVP4&t=1067.6s)]
*  were you kind of the glue in it? Do you feel like were you kind of the peacekeeper? Like what was [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLFvJ7OvVP4&t=1072.3999999999999s)]
*  your kind of role do you feel like? Or were you more like part of the problem or, you know, [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLFvJ7OvVP4&t=1076.24s)]
*  or you know what I'm saying? Like, cause you can be one or the other and it's some days, [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLFvJ7OvVP4&t=1081.04s)]
*  it's day to day. It's like some days I know it's like, okay, today I'm part of the solution and [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLFvJ7OvVP4&t=1084.16s)]
*  today I'm part of the problem. Yeah, dude. I'm absolutely both absolutely both, but you gotta [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLFvJ7OvVP4&t=1088.16s)]
*  have that, right? I guess. I don't know. Some people are good at just being part of the solution. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLFvJ7OvVP4&t=1092.56s)]
*  I feel like, yeah, that's true. That's probably the better way. Yeah. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLFvJ7OvVP4&t=1096.72s)]
*  I just don't know if yeah. And I think that's kind of boring though. Uh, yeah. Oh yeah. For sure. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLFvJ7OvVP4&t=1106.24s)]
*  Yeah. I just, yeah. I can't imagine that you guys survived that much because so many bands just [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLFvJ7OvVP4&t=1110.96s)]
*  disappeared. So many of them people, singers died. Like, um, yeah, even like stone table pot, [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLFvJ7OvVP4&t=1116.32s)]
*  like Scott Weiland, you know, like when I was growing up, like that was a crazy dude. Yes. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLFvJ7OvVP4&t=1121.44s)]

*  and herbs, mainly fennel and anise and a type of warm wood called Artemisia absinthium. Um, [[01:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLFvJ7OvVP4&t=6316.719999999999s)]

*  the fucking sounds, you know, like now it's like, you don't have to make the sounds anymore. The [[01:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLFvJ7OvVP4&t=6344.72s)]
*  sounds are all programmed or whatever. You guys had to actually fucking go out there and make them, [[01:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLFvJ7OvVP4&t=6349.360000000001s)]
*  you know, make them record them. Yeah. Do you look at band? I mean, you look at insane or like [[01:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLFvJ7OvVP4&t=6354.4800000000005s)]

*  it's like, you're fortunate at the time you got to be in. Do you ever get jealous of the time that [[01:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLFvJ7OvVP4&t=6374.72s)]
*  people have like, you know, not that you're still not making a lot of music and that, but it's like, [[01:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLFvJ7OvVP4&t=6378.64s)]

*  yeah, I, you know what, dude, I guess the good thing is I'm such a fan of so many styles of music [[01:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLFvJ7OvVP4&t=6387.92s)]
*  that I enjoy all of it. So whether you make it raw and live off the floor or make beats, [[01:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLFvJ7OvVP4&t=6396.0s)]
*  you know, or play, you know, record in the box and the computer and edit, I've done it all different [[01:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLFvJ7OvVP4&t=6404.72s)]
*  ways. So I really, I just like good music. I don't really care how it was made. So yeah, [[01:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLFvJ7OvVP4&t=6411.52s)]
*  it doesn't really, it doesn't bug me. You know, like I don't go like, ah, this shit today sucks. [[01:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLFvJ7OvVP4&t=6421.040000000001s)]
*  Yeah. Because there's some really great stuff and yeah, there's some shitty stuff. But I do like so [[01:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLFvJ7OvVP4&t=6426.080000000001s)]

*  question to. Cause I don't know. Are there things that you missed about the rise of things like [[01:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLFvJ7OvVP4&t=6436.4800000000005s)]
*  when things were starting? Cause sometimes you don't realize when things are popping, [[01:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLFvJ7OvVP4&t=6441.44s)]
*  like in the beginning that that's, that's the moment, you know? [[01:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLFvJ7OvVP4&t=6444.0s)]
*  You know what I miss more than anything, dude, I miss the fucking mystery, man. I miss the, [[01:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLFvJ7OvVP4&t=6448.24s)]

*  they're always changing. The guys like Prince never did fucking interviews. You always wonder [[01:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLFvJ7OvVP4&t=6466.16s)]
*  like, what's that guy do? The, the, the mystique. I miss that. Now we're just like, we know everything [[01:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLFvJ7OvVP4&t=6471.76s)]

*  fucking mystery, man. And that's a big part, I think of, of any art is the, the mystery of it. [[01:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLFvJ7OvVP4&t=6489.44s)]
*  You know, like, what are they fucking, what does that motherfucker eat in the morning? Or like, what, [[01:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLFvJ7OvVP4&t=6497.28s)]
*  you know, just like what the, all the, all the question marks are gone. And, and you don't see [[01:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLFvJ7OvVP4&t=6503.12s)]
*  that in new music. There's no, you know, I'm not sitting here going like, fuck, I gotta, I gotta [[01:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLFvJ7OvVP4&t=6509.919999999999s)]

*  God. Oh, that was so true. It was like, well, even looking back on those magazines and stuff, [[01:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLFvJ7OvVP4&t=6524.72s)]
*  like that's how we knew little pieces of shit. That's how you, it was like Sebastian Bach's head [[01:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLFvJ7OvVP4&t=6529.68s)]
*  was fucking bleeding. You had no idea why the picture was. And they told you to blur yet, [[01:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLFvJ7OvVP4&t=6534.32s)]
*  but you're like, fuck dude. And it's a still picture. It's not a video documentary on the [[01:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLFvJ7OvVP4&t=6541.2s)]
*  whole thing. Like fuck dude, we gotta see him when he comes here. You know, we're like, what is going [[01:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLFvJ7OvVP4&t=6546.72s)]
*  on? And then you start making shit up in your head. And that's where that's where it creation [[01:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLFvJ7OvVP4&t=6551.12s)]
*  came from, where creativity came from. Yes. You, you came up with how it may have happened, dude, [[01:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLFvJ7OvVP4&t=6556.16s)]
*  in waiting outside to get like tickets to something, dude, whether like it was to go see the crew, [[01:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLFvJ7OvVP4&t=6562.16s)]
*  whether it was to go see guns and roses, um, uh, Dio lock up the walls, like whether it was to go [[01:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLFvJ7OvVP4&t=6567.84s)]
*  see fucking 3 11. Like you'd have to wait out all night. Right. And thankfully some kid would [[01:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLFvJ7OvVP4&t=6574.32s)]
*  bring like his 11 year old brother and people would get them fucked up for the first time in [[01:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLFvJ7OvVP4&t=6580.88s)]
*  the parking lot. Yeah. You just be watching this fucking like little fat kid fucking like [[01:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLFvJ7OvVP4&t=6584.5599999999995s)]
*  take off his shirt and fucking eat bugs and shit. Oh my God. That would get you from two to four. [[01:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLFvJ7OvVP4&t=6590.639999999999s)]
*  And then somebody would go to the donut place and then it would be six and nine. Yes. Hold the line, [[01:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLFvJ7OvVP4&t=6596.48s)]
*  dude. And there was still only five people out there and it'd have been fine if you came at nine [[01:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLFvJ7OvVP4&t=6602.08s)]
*  AM. But now motherfucker, we waited all night for tickets. That was something to be said. It was [[01:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLFvJ7OvVP4&t=6606.88s)]
*  like a badge of honor. Yes. And you didn't know what happened. Like even when I saw, uh, man, [[01:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLFvJ7OvVP4&t=6611.2s)]
*  and Twiggy Ramirez, I think one of them, he cut the other guy's stomach or open with a bottle. [[01:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLFvJ7OvVP4&t=6616.96s)]
*  The ambulances came, took the guy out of there. What just happened, dude? Yeah. I remember being [[01:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLFvJ7OvVP4&t=6621.5199999999995s)]
*  in the bathroom. I was like 14 years old. Some guy goes, how old are these kids in here? And [[01:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLFvJ7OvVP4&t=6628.0s)]
*  somebody goes, I don't know. They look like they're about 14 and somebody's like, somebody's going to [[01:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLFvJ7OvVP4&t=6632.4s)]

*  But they took, they took the, the, the, whoever he caught with the box and we have, we had no idea [[01:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLFvJ7OvVP4&t=6642.4s)]
*  what happened. That's just your imagination. Like where the fuck is he? You know? Yes, dude, I, that [[01:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLFvJ7OvVP4&t=6648.08s)]

*  must, maybe, maybe it's the opposite. Maybe there's the thrill of that hunt of trying to find [[01:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLFvJ7OvVP4&t=6715.04s)]
*  something in the barrage that you're like, dude, I found this out there. Yeah. You know, maybe, [[01:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLFvJ7OvVP4&t=6720.72s)]
