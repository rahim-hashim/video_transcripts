*  I mean you want to climb in her throat and just start a family. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=50.900000000000006s)]
*  Or knit an American flag, you just want to dang just Betsy Ross around her tonsils baby. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=55.9s)]
*  She's just... I mean she has a timeless voice. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=61.86s)]
*  It sounds like it just comes out of the core of the earth. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=66.86s)]
*  And just, I mean it's just like a beautiful train just rolling through years. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=71.86s)]
*  She's got it. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=78.86s)]
*  She won the Female Vocalist of the Year at the 2022 Country Music Awards. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=80.86s)]

*  Today's guest is Lainey Wilson. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=98.82s)]
*  I love this stuff. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=111.82s)]
*  So when things get busy, it's interesting how they get. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=129.82s)]
*  You don't know who you're talking to, you don't know what you just did a line or four. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=132.82s)]
*  You don't know what's going on. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=136.82s)]
*  I always thought people were kind of full of it when they're like, [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=139.78s)]
*  I didn't know what city I was in, I didn't know what day it was. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=142.78s)]
*  It's true. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=145.78s)]
*  Sometimes I'll be halfway through the statement. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=147.78s)]
*  What's up? And I will have to check in my head. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=150.78s)]
*  Do you know what this is? [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=153.78s)]
*  There's times where all day long I'm like, all right, I'm in Salt Lake. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=155.78s)]
*  I get up there and I'm like, where am I? [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=159.78s)]
*  It can be kind of challenging. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=165.74s)]
*  Just because of how quick things happen and how busy you can get. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=168.74s)]
*  Can you move this a little bit in and down? [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=172.74s)]
*  But you can also move it if you feel like it. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=175.74s)]
*  Oh look, if you want to let loose. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=178.74s)]
*  I can unscrew it. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=181.74s)]
*  I love it. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=183.74s)]
*  I love your voice. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=185.74s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=187.74s)]
*  It's really nice. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=188.74s)]
*  It's a gift, I feel like, to the whole world. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=190.74s)]
*  I'm sure a lot of people feel that way. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=192.74s)]
*  I feel like when you're singing, somebody's singing from the past. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=195.70000000000002s)]
*  Really? [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=200.70000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, I just feel like it's coming from another... [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=202.70000000000002s)]
*  I'll take that, thank you. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=206.70000000000002s)]
*  ...plane or something. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=208.70000000000002s)]
*  Sometimes I feel like I was born in the wrong decade. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=210.70000000000002s)]
*  Really? [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=213.70000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, who knows what I was doing in a previous life. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=215.70000000000002s)]
*  I kind of have some weird feelings like that too. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=218.70000000000002s)]
*  Yeah? [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=221.70000000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=222.70000000000002s)]
*  Do you think of a time, do you feel like there's a time... [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=224.66s)]
*  Do you get a sense of what is going on around you at that time, [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=227.66s)]
*  if it was a past? [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=230.66s)]
*  I don't know what it was. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=232.66s)]
*  But I do feel like a little bit of an old soul. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=235.66s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=239.66s)]
*  Which I have some family members and stuff who I think kind of feel the same way. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=241.66s)]
*  So maybe it's just something like a little thing kind of passed down. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=245.66s)]
*  But yeah, I wonder who I was. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=248.66s)]
*  Who was I? [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=250.66s)]
*  Who were you? [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=253.62s)]
*  Oh, I know who you could have been. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=255.62s)]
*  You could have been like a train conductor, but before they had a whistle. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=257.62s)]
*  So you had to also be the whistle. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=260.62s)]
*  So you had to be like, whoo, whoo. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=262.62s)]
*  Like you had to really belt it out, you know? [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=264.62s)]
*  I'm just trying to think of something where you'd also have to be like real verbose [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=266.62s)]
*  and like let them know, you know? [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=269.62s)]
*  Toot toot. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=271.62s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=273.62s)]
*  And what if people would have come... [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=275.62s)]
*  Or what if somebody else was a conductor and you were the horn? [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=277.62s)]
*  No, I was a caboose. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=280.62s)]
*  I have seen some videos on TikTok. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=283.58s)]
*  You were probably the caboose. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=285.58s)]
*  You were probably the caboose. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=287.58s)]
*  When I tell you, I can't even get on TikTok without... [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=289.58s)]
*  People really coming for that romp, huh? [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=291.58s)]
*  Coming for the romp. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=293.58s)]
*  I've been in Nashville for 12 years trying to do music. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=295.58s)]
*  And here we are, the butt goes viral. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=298.58s)]
*  I mean, they find the music through the butt and they plan on sticking around. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=300.58s)]
*  But it's... [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=304.58s)]
*  I'm trying to embrace it. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=306.58s)]
*  Yeah, nothing will keep a man around like some butt, I think. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=308.58s)]
*  That's right. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=312.53999999999996s)]
*  I'm like, whatever makes them listen to the music. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=313.53999999999996s)]
*  Yeah, hey, look, sometimes they start with the bass section, you know, before they get to the treble, you know? [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=315.53999999999996s)]
*  That's it. That's exactly it. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=319.53999999999996s)]
*  I think that's all it is. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=321.53999999999996s)]
*  I think that's all it is too. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=322.53999999999996s)]
*  I mean, I didn't know how to feel about it in the beginning. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=324.53999999999996s)]
*  I was like... [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=326.53999999999996s)]
*  I thought it was going to be just this little tiny viral thing. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=328.53999999999996s)]
*  And next thing I know, weeks later, I'm still seeing big old butts. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=331.53999999999996s)]
*  Yeah, what was that? Can you pull that up, Ben? [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=335.53999999999996s)]
*  If you find that TikTok? [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=338.53999999999996s)]
*  I just remember seeing that and it was like... [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=341.5s)]
*  Yeah, it was like a side angle of you on a stage. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=343.5s)]
*  With the leopard pants. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=347.5s)]
*  Now, that'll probably do it too. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=349.5s)]
*  That was like an optical illusion. I don't think my butt's really that big. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=351.5s)]
*  I think it was the leopard. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=353.5s)]
*  I mean, maybe the leopard had a big butt. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=355.5s)]
*  Oh my... [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=357.5s)]
*  See, that was a good day. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=359.5s)]
*  Also, this is a widescreen. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=361.5s)]
*  Let's be honest. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=363.5s)]
*  I'm just saying... [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=365.5s)]
*  Y'all doing me dirty. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=367.5s)]
*  I think whatever that is, that thing is... [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=370.46s)]
*  You got that silver screen rear. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=372.46s)]
*  Dang, that thing is... [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=374.46s)]
*  It's out there. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=376.46s)]

*  You could have a sip of [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=628.14s)]
*  the local hose and you [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=630.14s)]

*  that get lodged in you. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=634.14s)]
*  It's definitely, it's in the world there. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=636.14s)]
*  How did that kind of start for you? [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=638.14s)]
*  Did your mother or father play? [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=640.14s)]

*  the loudest in church. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=650.14s)]

*  He's looking down like, that's of the devil. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=654.14s)]
*  That's of the devil. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=656.14s)]
*  But she loves music. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=658.14s)]
*  She loves to dance. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=660.14s)]
*  On both sides of my family, I have people [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=662.14s)]
*  who play musical instruments and stuff. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=664.14s)]
*  But in Basque, and I mean [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=666.14s)]
*  country music is more than just a genre. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=668.14s)]
*  It is truly a way of life. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=670.14s)]
*  And so growing up, you know, [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=672.14s)]
*  listening to a lot of 90s country, I just, [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=674.14s)]
*  we eat, sleep, and breathe it. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=676.14s)]
*  We talk about music. We'd sit around. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=678.14s)]
*  If I was riding the tractor with Daddy, [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=680.14s)]
*  that's what we were listening to. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=682.14s)]
*  And it was really a soundtrack [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=684.14s)]
*  to our lives. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=686.14s)]
*  And so I didn't even realize as a little girl [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=688.14s)]
*  that country music was like a genre of music. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=690.14s)]
*  I thought it was just, you know. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=692.14s)]
*  That's music. That's just it. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=694.14s)]
*  Wow. That's interesting. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=696.14s)]
*  And what about for you down there? [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=698.14s)]
*  Well, what, I'm trying to think [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=700.14s)]
*  of the first song I ever even heard, [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=702.14s)]
*  I think was Bon Jovi. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=704.14s)]
*  And I was lit, like, [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=706.14s)]
*  this babysitter was giving me a ride [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=708.14s)]
*  to YMCA camp. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=710.14s)]
*  And she played it. And I'd never been [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=712.14s)]
*  in a car with a woman before. That wasn't my mother. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=714.14s)]
*  And so I think it, [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=716.14s)]
*  like, everything seems so, [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=718.14s)]
*  like, real. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=720.14s)]
*  So my memories were, like, very alive. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=722.14s)]
*  And so I just remember being there. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=724.14s)]
*  And she let me put her [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=726.14s)]
*  seatbelt on. I remember it was. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=728.14s)]
*  Oh my gosh. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=730.14s)]
*  Because I think I was like, you know, [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=732.14s)]
*  we gotta be safe. You gotta be safe in here. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=734.14s)]
*  Let me buckle you up. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=736.14s)]
*  So I think she put mine on. And I was like, oh, let me put yours on. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=738.14s)]
*  So I took mine off. And then when I put hers on, [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=740.14s)]
*  I was kind of close to her body. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=742.14s)]
*  And so I remember, like, oh, man. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=744.14s)]
*  So then I was like, let's put yours on again. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=746.14s)]
*  I remember I kept, like, putting. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=748.14s)]
*  Let's unbuckle. We didn't do this the right way. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=750.14s)]
*  Let's do it again. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=752.14s)]
*  So I put her seatbelt on like seven times. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=754.14s)]
*  And then finally she, [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=756.14s)]
*  we start driving. And she put on Bon Jovi. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=758.14s)]
*  And I just remember hearing that was like the first song [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=760.14s)]
*  I ever heard. Really? [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=762.14s)]
*  The first time I ever heard [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=764.14s)]
*  a woman sing that I remember, [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=766.14s)]

*  And they had, I'm sure I heard stuff on the radio, but [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=770.14s)]
*  some girl in our talent show at school [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=774.14s)]

*  Oh, yeah. And when I got home, I literally, I [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=972.14s)]
*  remember laying down. It was the first time I ever just [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=974.14s)]
*  and then just woke up the next day. It was like, [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=976.14s)]
*  Oh, you were tired. I was tired. Yeah. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=978.14s)]
*  Yeah, it was nice. I know. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=980.14s)]
*  We used to, like during the summers [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=982.14s)]
*  when I was too little to actually help do [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=984.14s)]
*  anything, daddy would never let me plant [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=986.14s)]
*  because he knew I'd mess that up, but he would let [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=988.14s)]
*  me disc up the fields and stuff like that. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=990.14s)]
*  But we would take [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=992.14s)]
*  food out to the field and let the tailgate [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=994.14s)]
*  down and kind of that would be our little picnic [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=996.14s)]
*  table and have all the farmers come out. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=998.14s)]
*  It's a [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=1000.14s)]
*  good childhood memory. Yeah, I bet. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=1002.14s)]
*  Yeah. Do you remember [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=1004.14s)]
*  like having like a [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=1008.14s)]
*  real [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=1010.14s)]
*  connection to any female [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=1014.14s)]
*  singers when you were young? Like was there anybody [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=1016.14s)]
*  that really was like? Oh, yeah. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=1018.14s)]
*  I mean Dolly Parton. Oh, yeah. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=1020.14s)]
*  Everything about the woman. I mean [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=1022.14s)]
*  just the way that she carries [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=1024.1399999999999s)]
*  herself. I feel like she don't let [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=1026.1399999999999s)]
*  anybody run over her. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=1028.1399999999999s)]
*  She kind of tells it how it is with [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=1030.1399999999999s)]
*  like a little bow wrapped on top, you know? [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=1032.1399999999999s)]
*  Yeah. She's just incredible. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=1034.1399999999999s)]
*  Singer, songwriter. I've actually never [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=1036.1399999999999s)]
*  even met her. Really? But [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=1038.1399999999999s)]
*  I think I could, I've learned [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=1040.1399999999999s)]
*  a lot from her by not meeting her. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=1042.1399999999999s)]
*  So I can't imagine how much I would actually learn [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=1044.1399999999999s)]
*  from her if I sat down with her and [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=1046.1399999999999s)]
*  got some advice. I mean that would be [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=1048.1399999999999s)]
*  absolutely insane. But yeah, her [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=1050.14s)]

*  I was in sixth grade and [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=1078.14s)]
*  my teacher came in [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=1080.14s)]
*  with a little boombox on her shoulder and she [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=1082.14s)]
*  played it. And [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=1084.14s)]
*  even in the sixth grade, I remember how [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=1086.14s)]
*  that song made me feel. And I was like [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=1088.14s)]
*  whatever this [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=1090.14s)]
*  feeling is, like I want to make other people feel [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=1092.14s)]
*  that way. Wow. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=1094.14s)]
*  That song. Yeah. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=1096.14s)]
*  Music's so wild like that. I [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=1098.14s)]
*  realized that in the past year that a lot of music [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=1100.14s)]
*  it's like [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=1102.14s)]
*  sometimes you can't put into words what you're [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=1104.14s)]
*  trying to say, right? And a song [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=1106.14s)]
*  will do that. It's like [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=1108.14s)]
*  it's just such a gift because [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=1110.14s)]
*  it'll do that for you. It's crazy. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=1112.14s)]
*  I mean I have a hard time completing [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=1114.14s)]
*  full sentences. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=1116.14s)]
*  But I can write a dang song like [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=1118.14s)]
*  But I bet you, I don't know if out of [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=1120.14s)]
*  basket, if everybody would have got together [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=1122.14s)]
*  in a meeting if y'all could have put a sentence together. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=1124.14s)]
*  No judgment. I don't know. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=1126.14s)]
*  I'm just saying Louisiana, dude. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=1128.14s)]
*  You know how it is. Oh, bro. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=1130.14s)]
*  You will see. I mean there was, I remember [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=1132.14s)]
*  one kid turned in a paper and had no [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=1134.14s)]
*  punctuation in it one time in our class. That sounds [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=1136.14s)]
*  about right. And the teacher even showed it to [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=1138.14s)]
*  everybody. She's like, I've just never seen anything like [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=1140.14s)]

*  And for some of the North Louisiana folks [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=1188.14s)]
*  it's that way. But there's also a little bit of that [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=1190.14s)]
*  like, we're going to act like it ain't happening [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=1192.14s)]

*  The Lord, he did it. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=1206.14s)]
*  He spoke to me. Yep. [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=1208.14s)]
*  I've been there. [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=1210.14s)]
*  Yeah, I'm trying to think of [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=1212.14s)]
*  do you remember going [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=1214.14s)]
*  so if you went to like a high school dance, where [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=1216.14s)]
*  did you go to that at? [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=1218.14s)]
*  At the school. [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=1220.14s)]
*  At the, I mean. Were you guys at like Winsboro [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=1222.14s)]
*  or something? Where were you guys? In Winsboro. [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=1224.14s)]
*  Winsboro? Winsboro, that's where I went to school. [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=1226.14s)]
*  We used to go, I think to a grain elevator [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=1228.14s)]
*  there. I'm trying to think of what did we do there? We went. [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=1230.14s)]
*  Oh yeah, there was grain elevators. Was there? [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=1232.14s)]
*  Oh, yep. Yeah, I think when I was [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=1234.14s)]
*  working on that farm we would go up there [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=1236.14s)]
*  to drive. Maybe it was to [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=1238.14s)]
*  work, something like that. [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=1240.14s)]
*  We'd go to Winsboro. There's a big old grain elevator right [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=1242.14s)]
*  there in the middle of town across from the Walmart. [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=1244.14s)]
*  Oh, gang. Yep. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=1246.14s)]
*  Deer Park, where else would we go to? I don't remember. [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=1248.14s)]
*  Not many people know [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=1250.14s)]
*  Winsboro, so I'm surprised that that's [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=1252.14s)]
*  why I didn't even say. Oh yeah? Yeah. [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=1254.14s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, that's wild. [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=1256.14s)]
*  Well, we'd go up there, yeah, sometimes like [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=1258.14s)]

*  Oh, yeah. I think there's so much like [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=1562.14s)]
*  I'm losing [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=1564.14s)]
*  all my words today. But there's like [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=1566.14s)]
*  a lot of stuff is kind of romanticized. So it's [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=1568.14s)]
*  like, you know, we got to do this. It's us against the world. [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=1570.14s)]
*  I got a tiger by the tail. Let's go. [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=1572.14s)]

*  yeah. It was [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=1576.14s)]
*  but high school for me was [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=1578.14s)]
*  it was fun. [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=1580.14s)]
*  I will say that I'm not friends with [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=1582.14s)]
*  hardly any of the people that I graduated [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=1584.14s)]
*  with just because we're living completely [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=1586.14s)]
*  different lives. I might [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=1588.14s)]
*  there might be another person out of my [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=1590.14s)]
*  graduating class that's not married with kids. [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=1592.14s)]

*  And [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=1602.14s)]
*  but man, just like we were talking about earlier, like [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=1604.14s)]
*  people change, things change. [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=1606.14s)]
*  And sometimes you [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=1608.14s)]
*  figure out who people really are [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=1610.14s)]

*  Yeah, everybody's trying to be a Cyrus. [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=1900.14s)]
*  I feel like a lot of this could be a lot of faux Cyrus's [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=1902.14s)]
*  going. [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=1904.14s)]
*  I did a lot of like [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=1906.14s)]
*  I'll say whenever I first moved to Nashville [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=1908.14s)]
*  when I was living in my [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=1910.14s)]
*  camper trailer. [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=1912.14s)]
*  Were you living in there with a man? You were living in there by yourself? [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=1914.14s)]
*  By myself. Oh, dang. [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=1916.14s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. You have a security animal? [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=1918.14s)]
*  Yeah. Uh-uh. [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=1920.14s)]
*  So, long story short, [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=1922.14s)]
*  there was a guy from Baskin [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=1924.14s)]
*  who wanted to move to Nashville [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=1926.14s)]
*  and do music and he ended up [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=1928.14s)]
*  becoming a songwriter producer [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=1930.14s)]
*  and had some success like [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=1932.14s)]
*  in the 90s. [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=1934.14s)]
*  Okay. But he wanted to move [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=1936.14s)]
*  in the late 70s and [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=1938.14s)]
*  my grandfather on my daddy's side [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=1940.14s)]
*  he gave him just like a few hundred dollars to kind of [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=1942.14s)]
*  help him move to Nashville and get started. [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=1944.14s)]
*  So, as a favor in return, [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=1946.14s)]
*  he was my mentor kind of growing up. [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=1948.14s)]
*  He'd stop by my house whenever he came home to Baskin [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=1950.14s)]
*  and stuff. Okay. [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=1952.14s)]
*  He let me live in his studio [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=1954.14s)]
*  parking lot out in Bellevue [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=1956.14s)]
*  for free [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=1958.14s)]
*  for three years. So I hooked up the trailer [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=1960.14s)]
*  to the water, the Wi-Fi, [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=1962.14s)]
*  the electricity. I mean I flooded [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=1964.14s)]
*  the thing. I was having [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=1966.14s)]
*  plumbing issues and [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=1968.14s)]
*  nobody wanted to [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=1970.14s)]
*  help me work on the thing. So, you know, [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=1972.14s)]
*  I've got my daddy on the other line and he's like, [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=1974.14s)]
*  well, do this. Close off your valves. Fill up your tank. [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=1976.14s)]
*  Then, you know, let it run for [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=1978.14s)]
*  a while. Undo it and let it kind of flush out [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=1980.14s)]
*  while I fell asleep. [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=1982.14s)]
*  And the entire [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=1984.14s)]
*  Dane Camper trailer flooded. [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=1986.14s)]
*  It's, I mean, the floor [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=1988.14s)]
*  eventually started rotting out. You know, you [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=1990.14s)]
*  just had to be careful where you were stepping. [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=1992.14s)]
*  Jump over the other part to get to the bathroom, [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=1994.14s)]
*  you know. Oh, yeah. It's like Dance Dance [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=1996.14s)]

*  especially in a bad trailer. When they [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=2000.14s)]
*  start to go, they start to go. That's right. Yeah. [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=2002.14s)]

*  redone. And I [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=2006.14s)]

*  Gonzales and she had such a [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=2100.14s)]
*  positive attitude. Like one day she sends me a picture [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=2102.14s)]
*  of there's a branch through their kitchen, right? [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=2104.14s)]

*  I mean, obviously, with your career growing, [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=2140.14s)]
*  it's crazy how quick you can get to [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=2142.14s)]
*  places where you're like, okay, I [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=2144.14s)]
*  could maybe work with Miley Cyrus or I could maybe [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=2146.14s)]
*  work with Dolly Parton. Like it's probably, like [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=2148.14s)]
*  it's kind of like. It's crazy. That's wild. [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=2150.14s)]
*  It is wild. And [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=2152.14s)]
*  Mandolin and I, I mean, we've been working [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=2154.14s)]
*  together, which is my manager for [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=2156.14s)]
*  everybody listening. [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=2158.14s)]
*  We've been working together for [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=2160.14s)]
*  eight years. [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=2162.14s)]
*  Oh my gosh. We have, yeah. [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=2164.14s)]
*  And I mean, she was [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=2166.14s)]
*  setting me up, co-writing stuff when [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=2168.14s)]
*  I mean, nobody would give me [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=2170.14s)]
*  the time of day. She's like, y'all got to listen [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=2172.14s)]
*  to her. And everybody's like, who? No, sorry. [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=2174.14s)]
*  But we [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=2176.14s)]
*  have, we've been like, I mean, we're best [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=2178.14s)]
*  friends. We work very closely together. [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=2180.14s)]
*  And we've dreamed [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=2182.14s)]
*  up a lot of these things. I mean, everything we put on [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=2184.14s)]
*  our list for last year, we've accomplished [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=2186.14s)]
*  that and then then some. So [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=2188.14s)]
*  we were talking the other day, it's really cool [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=2190.14s)]
*  to be able to dream [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=2192.14s)]
*  a little bit bigger. It's like, my gosh, [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=2194.14s)]
*  like, it's really not that far fetch. [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=2196.14s)]
*  I mean, we got on a tour bus [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=2198.14s)]
*  last June. I've been [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=2200.14s)]
*  traveling in a flatbed truck for [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=2202.14s)]
*  10 years, you know, and [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=2204.14s)]
*  that seemed far fetch. [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=2206.14s)]
*  And now here we are. I mean, the wheels are turning [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=2208.14s)]
*  and we're [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=2210.14s)]
*  going to do it. We're going to accomplish everything on our list [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=2212.14s)]
*  this year. Wow. Yeah. [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=2214.14s)]
*  I love that. I don't even think we've made a list, [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=2216.14s)]
*  but we're going to make a list. She's made the list. [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=2218.14s)]
*  Well, it's scary. Yeah, she [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=2220.14s)]
*  probably has. That's good. It's scary. Like, [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=2222.14s)]
*  yeah, making a list and realizing that you can actually [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=2224.14s)]
*  like when you start to achieve some of your dreams, it's kind of [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=2226.14s)]
*  scary, kind of. It is. [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=2228.14s)]
*  And I'll say, you know, [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=2230.14s)]
*  I think I'm prepared [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=2232.14s)]
*  for what's going on, [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=2234.14s)]
*  but there's absolutely another level [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=2236.14s)]
*  of pressure to look good, [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=2238.14s)]
*  sound good, be good, be on, be prepared [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=2240.14s)]
*  for everything. Yeah, be fancy [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=2242.14s)]
*  enough. Yeah. I mean. [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=2244.14s)]
*  Seem the right way. But [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=2246.14s)]
*  some of that I think is also a trap, I think, [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=2248.14s)]
*  especially I feel like with country [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=2250.14s)]
*  music. I feel like people come [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=2252.14s)]
*  there because they want. I love [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=2254.14s)]
*  stories, right? And so that's why I think [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=2256.14s)]
*  I love a lot of country and singer-songwriter [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=2258.14s)]
*  stuff is because I [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=2260.14s)]
*  want to know the start. I just want to hear the story [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=2262.14s)]
*  a lot of times. That's right. [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=2264.14s)]
*  So I feel like it's [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=2266.14s)]
*  at least a genre where, in a [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=2268.14s)]
*  universe where you can be a little bit [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=2270.14s)]
*  more. You can. Normal. [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=2272.14s)]
*  Yeah. You don't have to look like [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=2274.14s)]
*  you got it all together. Yeah. [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=2276.14s)]
*  I don't, I'll tell you that. I do not. [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=2278.14s)]
*  And. Yeah, the less you have together, [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=2280.14s)]
*  the better. I mean, look Morgan's an example, right? [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=2282.14s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? Morgan is like. He's [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=2284.14s)]
*  relatable and. Yeah, he stays. [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=2286.14s)]
*  I mean, hell, he [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=2288.14s)]
*  lived, he lived [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=2290.14s)]
*  in like a, like a duplex. [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=2292.14s)]
*  I was like, how do you live here? Like you can't. [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=2294.14s)]
*  Yeah. You're too popular to [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=2296.14s)]
*  live here. Yeah. Right. Yeah. [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=2298.14s)]
*  But he tries to stay [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=2300.14s)]
*  as relatable as possible. Yeah. [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=2302.14s)]
*  He does a good job without. A lot of those guys [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=2304.14s)]
*  do now, you know. I know. Party, John [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=2306.14s)]
*  Party's kind of the same way. He's out there feeding his [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=2308.14s)]
*  animals. I know. He's screwing around. I think. I think you gotta do [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=2310.14s)]
*  things like that to, I mean, [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=2312.14s)]
*  if we're gonna write about it, we gotta do it. [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=2314.14s)]
*  Yeah, I've had some experience [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=2316.14s)]
*  with it, I think, you know. That's right. [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=2318.14s)]
*  But that gets scary as your life gets bigger and [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=2320.14s)]
*  busier. It's like you don't have [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=2322.14s)]
*  some of those same exact moments, you know. [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=2324.14s)]
*  For sure. I did just buy [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=2326.14s)]
*  me some land here [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=2328.14s)]
*  around Nashville that I'm excited to, [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=2330.14s)]
*  you know, kind of get back to some of that because [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=2332.14s)]
*  when I first got here, [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=2334.14s)]
*  I mean, [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=2336.14s)]
*  you just can't afford to have animals [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=2338.14s)]
*  and you can't afford to. [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=2340.14s)]
*  Oh, yeah. It's expensive. [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=2342.14s)]
*  Yeah, having an animal. [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=2344.14s)]
*  Yeah, I'm trying to think [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=2346.14s)]
*  of what kind of animal you would get. [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=2348.14s)]
*  I want to get me some horses. You do? [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=2350.14s)]
*  I grew up on a horse and. Can you [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=2352.14s)]
*  be on a horse easily? Oh, yeah. [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=2354.14s)]
*  Oh, really? Oh, yeah. [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=2356.14s)]
*  I definitely, I mean, we rodeo'd a little [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=2358.14s)]
*  bit. Me and my sister, we were [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=2360.14s)]
*  PRCA rodeo flag girls. [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=2362.14s)]
*  Oh, what is it? That big old butt stayed [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=2364.14s)]
*  in the saddle, you know what I'm talking about? [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=2366.14s)]
*  Oh, really? Now, is your [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=2368.14s)]
*  sister pretty cheeked up? Oh, she's pretty cheeked up. [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=2370.14s)]
*  It ain't as far out, but [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=2372.14s)]
*  it's definitely as far this way. [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=2374.14s)]
*  Okay, okay. Yeah, I like that. [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=2376.14s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. So she ain't going nowhere in the saddle [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=2378.14s)]
*  either. She got that J in the tray, [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=2380.14s)]
*  baby. That's what I like. Yeah, and her [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=2382.14s)]
*  name is Jana. Is it? [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=2384.14s)]
*  Jana. Jana. And does she have [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=2386.14s)]
*  a couple children or not? She does. Oh, yeah. [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=2388.14s)]

*  Oh, wow. And they are [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=2392.14s)]
*  bad. Yeah? They're cute, [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=2394.14s)]
*  but they're bad. They live in Louisiana? They live in [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=2396.14s)]
*  Louisiana. Oh, God, they sound like damn train [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=2398.14s)]
*  robbers. Uh-huh. They probably will be. [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=2400.14s)]
*  I know. [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=2402.14s)]
*  They probably will be. I love [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=2404.14s)]
*  them to death, and they [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=2406.14s)]
*  got to come to a show. I was [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=2408.14s)]
*  doing with Luke Combs out in Oklahoma City. That was [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=2410.14s)]
*  the first show that the boys got to see. [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=2412.14s)]
*  I think they were like, they had a little [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=2414.14s)]
*  bit of an idea what Aunt Wainy [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=2416.14s)]
*  does, but not really [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=2418.14s)]

*  And then I saw, you know, Jimmy [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=2710.14s)]
*  Allen. And then I saw Frank [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=2712.14s)]
*  Ray. He's an ex-Mexican cop. [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=2714.14s)]
*  And then I saw who [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=2716.14s)]
*  else was it? He said it just looked like a halfway [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=2718.14s)]
*  house. He said, and I said, this is [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=2720.14s)]
*  the place for me. [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=2722.14s)]
*  I'm like perfect. I'll take that. [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=2724.14s)]
*  He's the best, man. [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=2726.14s)]
*  A bunch of misfits. People love him. [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=2728.14s)]
*  He's so, I mean, [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=2730.14s)]
*  there ain't nobody like him. Nope. [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=2732.14s)]

*  stories. Yeah. [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=2742.14s)]
*  And you get, you want to, and you [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=2744.14s)]
*  love him. Like the music obviously is great [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=2746.14s)]
*  and he's had a, he's even had a number one. [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=2748.14s)]
*  I mean, how far did his son of a [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=2750.14s)]
*  center go? It's so good. It did go [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=2752.14s)]
*  number one. [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=2754.14s)]
*  It's so good. [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=2756.14s)]
*  Yep. Sorry. [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=2758.14s)]
*  But yeah, [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=2760.14s)]
*  there's just something about him and he's got so many great stories. [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=2762.14s)]
*  He just, just everything about him. [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=2764.14s)]
*  I know. It's like, even if the music wasn't good, you'd still want to [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=2766.14s)]
*  root for him. But it's just a plus that the music [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=2768.14s)]
*  is good. Right. [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=2770.14s)]
*  Yeah, I think there's just, yeah, [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=2772.14s)]
*  you just love him so much. I think that's [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=2774.14s)]
*  the, I feel like there's two [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=2776.14s)]
*  types of artists in almost any genre. [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=2778.14s)]
*  I think you're, or in any [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=2780.14s)]
*  like template of art, [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=2782.14s)]
*  you're either like, people [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=2784.14s)]
*  are there for you or they're there for [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=2786.14s)]
*  the art. That's right. And sometimes [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=2788.14s)]
*  it's both. And sometimes, yeah, you're [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=2790.14s)]
*  right. But some guys, it's like you get, [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=2792.14s)]
*  or your reason you get into them [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=2794.14s)]
*  is one or the other. I know. [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=2796.14s)]
*  I mean, it's just, yeah. Because sometimes it's [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=2798.14s)]
*  like, I like the person so much, I almost [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=2800.14s)]
*  don't care what they make. [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=2802.14s)]
*  I agree. I mean, I got some [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=2804.14s)]
*  buddies, so I'm like, ooh, [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=2806.14s)]
*  that is, [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=2808.14s)]
*  but I love you. [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=2810.14s)]
*  But I love you. [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=2812.14s)]
*  Yeah, but I'm going to get some oysters, [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=2814.14s)]
*  actually. So I'm excited about that, I think. [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=2816.14s)]
*  But oysters [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=2818.14s)]
*  are so weird. Oysters are like, [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=2820.14s)]
*  I think they're supposed to not be eating. [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=2822.14s)]
*  Here's the thing. For me, it [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=2826.14s)]
*  like depends on the day. And I'm kind of the same way [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=2828.14s)]
*  with sushi, too. It just depends on [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=2830.14s)]
*  the day whether I can actually do them raw or not. [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=2832.14s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=2834.14s)]
*  I will say, if you haven't been, in Hendersonville, [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=2836.14s)]
*  there's a place called Moby Dickies. [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=2838.14s)]
*  It's on the water. [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=2840.14s)]
*  And I wouldn't normally like eat [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=2842.14s)]
*  oysters around here, but [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=2844.14s)]
*  they have some really good [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=2846.14s)]
*  oysters. But why wouldn't you eat them around here? [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=2848.14s)]
*  I don't know. I mean, I just feel like [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=2850.14s)]
*  eating them in South Louisiana is probably a little bit better. [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=2852.14s)]
*  That's true. Yeah, it seemed like [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=2854.14s)]
*  how'd they get up here, you know? Did they uber [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=2856.14s)]
*  or were they trained up here? Yeah, I think they ubered. [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=2858.14s)]
*  I don't know, they might have lift. [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=2860.14s)]
*  They usually lift, for sure. Yeah, oysters seem like they usually lift. [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=2862.14s)]
*  Yeah, they definitely lift them. Because oysters aren't [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=2864.14s)]
*  supposed to be eaten. First of all, who would [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=2866.14s)]
*  eat if you, [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=2868.14s)]
*  I can't imagine [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=2870.14s)]
*  you'd have to be, I feel like [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=2872.14s)]
*  some type of pedophile or something, to open [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=2874.14s)]
*  something that small and put your dang tongue in. [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=2876.14s)]
*  You know, you're right. It's a little bit [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=2878.14s)]
*  It's a little bit weird. [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=2880.14s)]
*  Yeah, I think we all might be a little weird. [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=2882.14s)]
*  It's a little, I mean, it's like, cause [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=2884.14s)]
*  it's just so small, I just, [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=2886.14s)]
*  I don't know, every time I open them, I feel bad. [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=2888.14s)]
*  But I tell you what, I feel like [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=2890.14s)]
*  I'm from Louisiana every time I do it. I'm like, [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=2892.14s)]
*  I'm doing this cause I'm from Louisiana. [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=2894.14s)]
*  You know? [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=2896.14s)]
*  Crawfish though? [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=2898.14s)]
*  I mean, I'll make a special trip home [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=2900.14s)]
*  just to go get me some crawfish. [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=2902.14s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah, but that oyster, [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=2904.14s)]
*  every time I open it, I feel like its parents aren't home, you know? [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=2906.14s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. I just feel like [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=2908.14s)]
*  sneaky. I just feel bad. [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=2910.14s)]
*  Just nasty. I mean, [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=2912.14s)]
*  I won't say nasty, but I feel [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=2914.14s)]
*  nasty. I feel a little bit like a creep, kinda. [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=2916.14s)]
*  Yeah, I agree. [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=2918.14s)]
*  So you got into some acting, right? [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=2920.14s)]
*  Yep. [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=2922.14s)]

*  music video that he was doing with Uncle Cracker. [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=2964.14s)]

*  I wish it wouldn't have been that way. [[01:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=4772.14s)]
*  I mean [[01:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=4774.14s)]
*  I mean even it's weird [[01:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=4776.14s)]
*  because I'm experiencing [[01:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=4778.14s)]
*  really great things with my career [[01:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=4780.14s)]
*  right now. Even when I was filming Yellowstone, I was [[01:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=4782.14s)]
*  going through, like we were losing my daddy. [[01:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=4784.14s)]
*  He ended up surviving [[01:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=4786.14s)]
*  but he spent two months in [[01:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=4788.14s)]
*  ICU and I was having [[01:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=4790.14s)]
*  actually a few of those scenes right there. [[01:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=4792.14s)]
*  I would go over to the corner and cry [[01:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=4794.14s)]
*  and then come back and then shoot it again. [[01:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=4796.14s)]
*  It just seems [[01:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=4798.14s)]
*  sometimes I'm like, man, [[01:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=4800.14s)]
*  am I supposed to go through these things [[01:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=4802.14s)]
*  so I can be more [[01:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=4804.14s)]
*  relatable to people and be [[01:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=4806.14s)]
*  more understanding and be able to write the kind [[01:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=4808.14s)]
*  of music that people are really going to [[01:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=4810.14s)]
*  connect to and listen to and that's [[01:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=4812.14s)]
*  kind of what I chalk it up to sometimes because [[01:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=4814.14s)]
*  I mean life ain't easy. [[01:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=4816.14s)]
*  It is what it is. [[01:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=4818.14s)]
*  You just got to keep rolling. Yeah and sometimes [[01:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=4820.14s)]
*  it's like, I don't know, I feel like [[01:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=4822.14s)]
*  sometimes like God [[01:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=4824.14s)]
*  has a way of reaching people, right? And not [[01:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=4826.14s)]
*  like religious or anything but it's like sometimes you're just [[01:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=4828.14s)]
*  part of that way. That's right. [[01:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=4830.14s)]
*  You know and it's not even [[01:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=4832.14s)]
*  yet you have talents and stuff [[01:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=4834.14s)]
*  but it's like sometimes some things they're [[01:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=4836.14s)]
*  so, especially with music, [[01:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=4838.14s)]
*  it's like man this thing is [[01:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=4840.14s)]
*  and so many people have written and you know there's [[01:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=4842.14s)]
*  other people playing and it's like really to make [[01:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=4844.14s)]
*  this thing, it's like it takes a [[01:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=4846.14s)]
*  a village. It does take a village. [[01:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=4848.14s)]
*  You know? I like the best [[01:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=4850.14s)]
*  way for me to explain it to people who [[01:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=4852.14s)]
*  ask about the industry. I just say it's like [[01:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=4854.14s)]
*  the artist is like at the center of the wheel [[01:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=4856.14s)]
*  and there's a million different [[01:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=4858.14s)]
*  spokes. I mean you got your label, [[01:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=4860.14s)]
*  you got your management, you got your business manager, [[01:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=4862.14s)]
*  you got your tour manager, you got your band, [[01:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=4864.14s)]
*  you got publicity, [[01:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=4866.14s)]
*  you got publishing. [[01:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=4868.14s)]
*  So many different spokes to the wheel [[01:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=4870.14s)]
*  and all of them have to be turning [[01:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=4872.14s)]
*  fluid. You know they all have [[01:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=4874.14s)]
*  to be lining up. And if [[01:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=4876.14s)]
*  one little thing is off, [[01:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=4878.14s)]
*  you in a ditch. Yeah you in a ditch. [[01:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=4880.14s)]
*  You're on a unicycle [[01:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=4882.14s)]
*  in a dang ditch. That is it. [[01:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=4884.14s)]
*  That is, that's the best way to explain it. [[01:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=4886.14s)]
*  With crab in your hair boo. [[01:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=4888.14s)]
*  Uh huh. Um, what happened [[01:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=4890.14s)]
*  with your father? He was sick? Yes [[01:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=4892.14s)]
*  it was actually a fungal infection. [[01:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=4894.14s)]
*  Oh dang. That um, [[01:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=4896.14s)]
*  kind of took out the left side of the [[01:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=4898.14s)]
*  inside of his face. So [[01:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=4900.14s)]
*  anything that this fungus touched [[01:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=4902.14s)]
*  just it turned to [[01:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=4904.14s)]
*  dirt. It's like the most like [[01:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=4906.14s)]
*  aggressive type of fungus there is. How do you [[01:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=4908.14s)]
*  get it? Um, I [[01:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=4910.14s)]
*  mean it could have been from the farm, it could have [[01:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=4912.14s)]
*  been from the barn, anything [[01:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=4914.14s)]
*  like that. Super rare. Super rare. [[01:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=4916.14s)]
*  And he's actually the [[01:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=4918.14s)]
*  with the people who were kind of like leading the case and stuff [[01:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=4920.14s)]
*  he's the second person to ever survive it [[01:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=4922.14s)]
*  that they've worked with. And with a few of [[01:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=4924.14s)]
*  the doctors he's the first one [[01:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=4926.14s)]
*  to ever survive it. But he had [[01:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=4928.14s)]
*  nine surgeries in a [[01:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=4930.14s)]
*  month and a half. They kept going in to remove [[01:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=4932.14s)]
*  the fungus and then he had a stroke on [[01:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=4934.14s)]
*  top of all that. Oh man [[01:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=4936.14s)]
*  that must have been heartbreaking. [[01:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=4938.14s)]
*  It was and he still [[01:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=4940.14s)]
*  got a little ways to go. But actually [[01:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=4942.14s)]
*  this [[01:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=4944.14s)]
*  past week a big [[01:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=4946.14s)]
*  old praise report he went back to work [[01:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=4948.14s)]
*  several, just for like a couple hours [[01:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=4950.14s)]
*  just to go up there and kind of bullshit with some of his friends. [[01:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=4952.14s)]
*  But that right there. That's work in Louisiana. [[01:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=4954.14s)]
*  That's work and that's also [[01:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=4956.14s)]
*  just, that's a big old step. [[01:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=4958.14s)]
*  So. Wow [[01:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=4960.14s)]
*  that must have felt awesome for him. [[01:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=4962.14s)]
*  Yup. I'm ready for him to be able to [[01:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=4964.14s)]
*  I mean he's still driving the tractor and he's doing [[01:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=4966.14s)]
*  stuff like that. But ready [[01:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=4968.14s)]
*  for him to start having some more interactions [[01:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=4970.14s)]
*  with people. Because I think just interacting [[01:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=4972.14s)]
*  with people is healing [[01:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=4974.14s)]
*  in general. Yeah. You've healed me today. [[01:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=4976.14s)]
*  Oh. Well thanks. [[01:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=4978.14s)]
*  Back at you. Yeah I've just felt so [[01:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=4980.14s)]
*  off my, I don't even know what's going on [[01:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=4982.14s)]
*  today. I get it. You do? [[01:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=4984.14s)]
*  I get it. Well you're moving right now. [[01:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=4986.14s)]
*  No I [[01:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=4988.14s)]
*  trust me. For me it's like [[01:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=4990.14s)]
*  it's just like that mojo [[01:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=4992.14s)]
*  that you find right before you go on stage. [[01:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=4994.14s)]
*  Sometimes it's hard to find that. [[01:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=4996.14s)]
*  Like impossible. [[01:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=4998.14s)]
*  Impossible. Yeah. [[01:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=5000.14s)]
*  Is it, are there [[01:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=5002.14s)]
*  shows and obviously I'm sure all your [[01:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=5004.14s)]
*  shows are great. Are there shows and moments [[01:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=5006.14s)]
*  where it's like, are there some [[01:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=5008.14s)]
*  shows where for some reason you're [[01:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=5010.14s)]
*  able to hit another gear? [[01:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=5012.14s)]
*  I find that with comedy. Yes. I don't know if it's like that [[01:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=5014.14s)]
*  with music at all. Oh it absolutely [[01:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=5016.14s)]
*  is. I feed off the crowd. [[01:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=5018.14s)]
*  And you probably do the same exact [[01:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=5020.14s)]
*  thing. I feel like it's like an energy exchange. [[01:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=5022.14s)]
*  Like if their energy is up here, [[01:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=5024.14s)]
*  that's where I'm at. If their energy's down here [[01:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=5026.14s)]
*  that's kind of where I'm at too. [[01:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=5028.14s)]
*  I mean one little thing [[01:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=5030.14s)]
*  can throw the show all off. Like the other [[01:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=5032.14s)]
*  night I had somebody spit at me. [[01:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=5034.14s)]
*  I'm like why are you going to pay for a ticket [[01:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=5036.14s)]
*  then spit at me? Like I ain't trying [[01:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=5038.14s)]
*  to fight nobody tonight. And I had [[01:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=5040.14s)]
*  that in my brain the whole night. [[01:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=5042.14s)]
*  You know? [[01:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=5044.14s)]
*  And then it kind of, you can go down rabbit holes [[01:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=5046.14s)]
*  of why are they spitting at me, don't they? [[01:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=5048.14s)]
*  Yeah. Who's spitting? [[01:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=5050.14s)]
*  Yeah. And you see somebody just spitting like dip [[01:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=5052.14s)]
*  and you're like fuck him. [[01:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=5054.14s)]
*  You just start losing on anybody. [[01:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=5056.14s)]
*  There he is. That's him right there. Get him out. [[01:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=5058.14s)]
*  Some guys drool and some guys like [[01:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=5060.14s)]
*  he has like a Bell's palsy. [[01:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=5062.14s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That's him. He did it. [[01:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=5064.14s)]
*  Oh we had a show the other [[01:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=5066.14s)]
*  night. Some girl was just what [[01:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=5068.14s)]
*  and usually for comedy [[01:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=5070.14s)]
*  you want people to be quiet. Yeah. [[01:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=5072.14s)]
*  So oddly it's kind of the opposite. [[01:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=5074.14s)]
*  You want it to be silent because [[01:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=5076.14s)]
*  you'll use the silence to kind of create the next [[01:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=5078.14s)]
*  moment for the joke. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. [[01:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=5080.14s)]
*  So you want them to laugh when they're, you know, when it's [[01:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=5082.14s)]
*  funny but you want them to otherwise kind of [[01:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=5084.14s)]
*  and people want to yell out stuff, you know, [[01:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=5086.14s)]
*  and just yell out cocaine and all kind of shit [[01:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=5088.14s)]
*  sometimes. Yeah. I know. When everybody on the crowd [[01:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=5090.14s)]
*  is saying free bird. Yeah. Free bird. And I'm like [[01:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=5092.14s)]
*  the amount of times I've heard that. [[01:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=5094.14s)]
*  Yeah. So. Yeah. It's like the other [[01:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=5096.14s)]
*  night the show is just it threw everything off so [[01:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=5098.14s)]
*  much in the beginning that it was just kind of a bad show [[01:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=5100.14s)]
*  I felt like. I know. I get that. [[01:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=5102.14s)]
*  And it's hard to kind of come back from [[01:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=5104.14s)]
*  it. Yeah. It's hard to [[01:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=5106.14s)]
*  bounce. Yeah. Sometimes it's hard to bounce back. It's just [[01:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=5108.14s)]
*  and sometimes you just got to chalk it up [[01:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=5110.14s)]
*  to that's just how the night went. The crowd [[01:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=5112.14s)]
*  sometimes doesn't even know. I know. [[01:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=5114.14s)]
*  Yeah. They have no clue because there's times [[01:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=5116.14s)]
*  where I'll get off stage and [[01:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=5118.14s)]
*  I'll tell my band like oh my [[01:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=5120.14s)]
*  gosh I was like struggling tonight. [[01:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=5122.14s)]
*  I could not find that that [[01:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=5124.14s)]
*  thing or I was like I was searching [[01:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=5126.14s)]
*  for that certain feeling, you know? Yeah. [[01:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=5128.14s)]
*  And. That's what it is. [[01:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=5130.14s)]
*  And I didn't get that feeling so therefore I feel [[01:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=5132.14s)]
*  like I let myself down or let everybody else [[01:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=5134.14s)]
*  down and the band was like oh my gosh [[01:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=5136.14s)]
*  to me that was one of the best shows that we played yet [[01:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=5138.14s)]
*  and I'm like is [[01:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=5140.14s)]
*  something wrong with me? Yeah. [[01:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=5142.14s)]
*  And then there's times where they're like I did terrible [[01:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=5144.14s)]
*  tonight and I'm like this is the best show we've ever played [[01:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=5146.14s)]
*  because of that feeling. Yeah. [[01:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=5148.14s)]
*  That's exactly what it is. [[01:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=5150.14s)]
*  I'm looking it's almost selfish. I'm looking for some [[01:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=5152.14s)]
*  feeling that I think that that I usually [[01:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=5154.14s)]
*  get when the show feels good to me. [[01:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=5156.14s)]
*  Yes. And they might not [[01:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=5158.14s)]
*  have any clue. No. They're [[01:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=5160.14s)]
*  thinking that is the best thing I've ever seen. [[01:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=5162.14s)]
*  Yeah. That is the funniest thing I've ever seen. [[01:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=5164.14s)]
*  It's interesting. We had a, yeah [[01:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=5168.14s)]
*  usually it's a woman that gets crazy at a comedy [[01:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=5170.14s)]
*  show sometimes it's like a lot of times [[01:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=5172.14s)]
*  it's a woman that'll get outrageous kind of. [[01:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=5174.14s)]
*  Like a drunk woman or something. Yeah, yeah. A real drunk [[01:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=5176.14s)]
*  lady. She'll get drunk. [[01:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=5178.14s)]
*  How do you deal with that? We end up [[01:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=5180.14s)]
*  usually tossing them out. Yeah. [[01:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=5182.14s)]
*  Yeah. Because then it just sidetracks you [[01:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=5184.14s)]
*  completely. But then you have to deal with her husband or boyfriend and he's like [[01:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=5186.14s)]
*  you know Muffin [[01:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=5188.14s)]
*  never gets drunk and I'm like well first of all [[01:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=5190.14s)]
*  Muffin gets drunk. That's right and Muffin is drunk tonight [[01:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=5192.14s)]
*  and Muffin gotta go. [[01:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=5194.14s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. We need to put Muffin [[01:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=5196.14s)]
*  in the damn to-go box. I wanna meet Muffin [[01:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=5198.14s)]
*  though. She does sound like a good time. [[01:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=5200.14s)]
*  Um. [[01:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=5204.14s)]
*  I'm trying to think of what else. I mean obviously your career [[01:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=5206.14s)]
*  just really speaks for itself you know. [[01:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=5208.14s)]
*  I'm grateful that we got to sit and chat [[01:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=5210.14s)]
*  a little bit. Anything Ben that you wanted to bring up? [[01:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=5212.14s)]
*  For you do you have [[01:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=5214.14s)]
*  little pieces of the puzzle that help you [[01:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=5216.14s)]
*  start writing a song, finish a [[01:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=5218.14s)]
*  song? Yeah. What do you tell those writers listening to you right now? [[01:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=5220.14s)]
*  Yeah, I like that. [[01:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=5222.14s)]
*  What is it? [[01:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=5224.14s)]
*  What is it? [[01:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=5226.14s)]
*  That is a big old question. You're gonna have to [[01:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=5228.14s)]
*  repeat it again. Cause I barely know him. [[01:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=5230.14s)]
*  Okay basically like no here's the [[01:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=5232.14s)]
*  easy version. Um. [[01:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=5234.14s)]
*  What is like my songwriting process like? [[01:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=5236.14s)]
*  Because it's probably pretty dang similar to like [[01:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=5238.14s)]
*  the way that you write. [[01:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=5240.14s)]
*  Okay. You know. Um. For me [[01:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=5242.14s)]
*  the cool thing about songwriting is [[01:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=5244.14s)]
*  it's different every single time. [[01:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=5246.14s)]
*  I mean I sit down I mean I feel like some people [[01:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=5248.14s)]
*  you know they start with [[01:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=5250.14s)]
*  one thing pretty much all the time. [[01:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=5252.14s)]
*  But for me it could start with a melody. [[01:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=5254.14s)]
*  It could start with a guitar riff. [[01:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=5256.14s)]
*  Um. But no matter [[01:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=5258.14s)]
*  what it always starts with [[01:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=5260.14s)]
*  an idea for me. [[01:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=5262.14s)]
*  I keep this little list in my phone [[01:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=5264.14s)]
*  called my hook book. And that's where [[01:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=5266.14s)]
*  I just you know probably you probably do the same [[01:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=5268.14s)]
*  thing. You jot down stuff. Yeah mine's kind of [[01:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=5270.14s)]
*  seedy women. Yeah. [[01:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=5272.14s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So. [[01:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=5274.14s)]
*  Then I'll look through there. But at the end of the day [[01:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=5276.14s)]
*  I feel like I've been [[01:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=5278.14s)]
*  given the opportunity to write with so [[01:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=5280.14s)]
*  many incredible writers here in Nashville [[01:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=5282.14s)]
*  that they've kind of taught me how to [[01:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=5284.14s)]
*  put myself into the shoes of [[01:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=5286.14s)]
*  whatever it is that we're writing about. [[01:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=5288.14s)]
*  I mean if we wanted to write about this thing [[01:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=5290.14s)]
*  right here you know. Then [[01:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=5292.14s)]
*  they've kind of taught me how to like feel that for [[01:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=5294.14s)]
*  everything that it is. And write from that [[01:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=5296.14s)]
*  perspective which is pretty dang [[01:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=5298.14s)]
*  therapeutic. Um. [[01:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=5300.14s)]
*  Oh that's interesting. Yeah. So you find [[01:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=5302.14s)]
*  there's a lot of therapy in it really. It is. [[01:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=5304.14s)]
*  And sometimes I mean [[01:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=5306.14s)]
*  of course a lot of my songs I have and [[01:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=5308.14s)]
*  most of the songs I end up cutting [[01:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=5310.14s)]
*  are songs that are super personal [[01:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=5312.14s)]
*  to me. But there is something really cool [[01:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=5314.14s)]
*  about kind of just stepping [[01:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=5316.14s)]
*  outside of your shoes for a minute and putting [[01:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=5318.14s)]
*  yourself into somebody else's. [[01:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=5320.14s)]
*  And that is [[01:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=5322.14s)]
*  it's very freeing. [[01:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=5324.14s)]
*  I love it. [[01:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=5326.14s)]
*  I love song. I mean songwriting was my number one. [[01:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=5328.14s)]
*  I mean like I said [[01:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=5330.14s)]
*  wrote my first song at nine years old and when I moved [[01:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=5332.14s)]
*  here to Nashville [[01:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=5334.14s)]
*  that's what songwriting [[01:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=5336.14s)]
*  was the foot that I led with. [[01:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=5338.14s)]
*  I figured that was my strength and [[01:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=5340.14s)]
*  that's the only way that I could you know [[01:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=5342.14s)]
*  maybe get my foot in the door. [[01:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=5344.14s)]
*  Was through my songwriting so [[01:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=5346.14s)]
*  it serves a very [[01:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=5348.14s)]

*  to write country songs. I used to [[01:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=5358.14s)]
*  yeah sometimes when I was working on that [[01:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=5360.14s)]
*  tractor I would stop it and I would stand out [[01:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=5362.14s)]
*  on it and listen to like Top 40 Country. [[01:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=5364.14s)]

*  where you thought you would just be a songwriter? [[01:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=5380.14s)]
*  I always knew that [[01:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=5384.14s)]

*  that happen in artists like I just [[01:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=5388.14s)]
*  wonder like because sometimes with comedians right [[01:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=5390.14s)]

*  know if the dream ever goes away to [[01:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=5404.14s)]
*  just do comedy but sometimes life gets in the [[01:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=5406.14s)]
*  way you'll get a family or something. [[01:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=5408.14s)]
*  Yeah and things kind of have to shift. [[01:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=5410.14s)]
*  I'll say [[01:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=5412.14s)]
*  I didn't want to have to choose. [[01:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=5414.14s)]
*  I was like I can do both. I'm going to be [[01:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=5416.14s)]
*  a songwriter. I'm going to be an artist. I'm going to [[01:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=5418.14s)]

*  somebody who was [[01:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=5422.14s)]
*  who I was working with at the time [[01:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=5424.14s)]
*  who made me believe you can't be both. [[01:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=5426.14s)]
*  He was like [[01:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=5428.14s)]
*  you got to choose. Are you a songwriter or are you [[01:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=5430.14s)]
*  an artist? And I'm like I'm both. [[01:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=5432.14s)]
*  He's like no no no but you got to like you got to really [[01:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=5434.14s)]
*  and I'm like no. [[01:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=5436.14s)]

*  successful artists. [[01:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=5440.14s)]

*  for decades and decades for decades you know. [[01:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=5444.14s)]
*  They write their own stuff and they sing [[01:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=5446.14s)]
*  their own stuff and it doesn't mean that I'm [[01:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=5448.14s)]
*  opposed to you know cutting [[01:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=5450.14s)]
*  outside songs at the end of the day. Like I said [[01:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=5452.14s)]
*  the best idea and the best song wins. [[01:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=5454.14s)]

*  be scared to step outside of the box. And in my opinion [[01:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=5472.14s)]
*  that's not even really stepping outside of the box. It's just [[01:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=5474.14s)]
*  singing the stuff that you wrote. Yeah. [[01:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=5476.14s)]

*  You got AC and awards? [[01:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=5646.14s)]
*  AC like there were so many things that we had done [[01:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=5648.14s)]
*  but I still could barely sell a ticket. [[01:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=5650.14s)]
*  I sold like [[01:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=5652.14s)]
*  was it 100 or like 91 tickets or something [[01:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=5654.14s)]
*  like that and a lot of people [[01:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=5656.14s)]
*  there were family [[01:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=5658.14s)]
*  and it was like where [[01:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=5660.14s)]
*  like where is this not [[01:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=5662.14s)]
*  connecting you know like I feel like [[01:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=5664.14s)]
*  we won some awards we got some number [[01:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=5666.14s)]
*  ones but still at that time I was [[01:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=5668.14s)]
*  pretty faceless. I think [[01:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=5670.14s)]
*  that's what happens with a lot of [[01:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=5672.14s)]
*  artists. So explain that to me when you say faceless [[01:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=5674.14s)]
*  because this is interesting. Yeah. I think a lot of people [[01:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=5676.14s)]
*  know songs on the radio. [[01:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=5678.14s)]
*  I think during that time if you would have [[01:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=5680.14s)]
*  asked anybody who listens to country music like [[01:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=5682.14s)]
*  you know that song Things A Man [[01:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=5684.14s)]
*  ought to know. They all would have said [[01:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=5686.14s)]
*  yes but they did not [[01:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=5688.14s)]
*  know me. [[01:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=5690.14s)]
*  And that's where the disconnect [[01:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=5692.14s)]
*  is and I think that's really where [[01:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=5694.14s)]
*  Yellowstone has been [[01:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=5696.14s)]
*  so beneficial because [[01:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=5698.14s)]
*  you know they see your name up on the screen [[01:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=5700.14s)]
*  and stuff and then they [[01:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=5702.14s)]
*  finally just like see your face and [[01:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=5704.14s)]
*  they're like oh okay and then they [[01:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=5706.14s)]
*  have to see it a million other times [[01:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=5708.14s)]
*  for it to really really connect. [[01:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=5710.14s)]
*  How many times they say you got a [[01:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=5712.14s)]
*  Yeah you have to have like 12 to 15 [[01:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alB59LAu9w8&t=5718.14s)]
