*  Today's guest is an award-winning country musician and songwriter. He's out [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=0.0s)]
*  of North Carolina and has gone on to become one of the biggest names in [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=6.62s)]
*  entertainment. He has a new album, Fathers and Sons, which is coming out [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=11.58s)]
*  just before Father's Day and I'm thankful to sit with him today. My new [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=16.38s)]
*  friend, Mr. Luke Cone. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=21.44s)]
*  I'll spin and tell you my stories. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=30.0s)]
*  Shine on me. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=34.0s)]
*  And I will find a song I will sing. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=38.0s)]
*  That's galvanized, isn't it? [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=50.0s)]
*  It is. Yeah, you can just, you can really hear the nails go across it. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=52.0s)]
*  That's how you know it's got rivets inside of it, you know? [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=56.0s)]
*  That's like redneck ASMR. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=61.0s)]
*  You know there's just some dude who woke up in his trailer and he's just trying to quietly eat the leftovers without his wife here. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=64.0s)]
*  Hold on, there is a guy, dude, and don't ask me how this comes across my feed. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=72.0s)]
*  But it's like, day 600 of me spraying dog medicine on my hands until I can strike a match off my knuckles. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=77.0s)]
*  And I'm like, why do I care so much about this guy striking a match off his knuckles? [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=84.0s)]
*  But dude, and at the end of every video, dude, it's him. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=89.0s)]
*  And at the beginning he'll go, now there's a sensory nightmare at the end of this video and it's him going, [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=92.0s)]
*  and it's like his sandpaper ass hands like going in the mic, dude. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=97.0s)]
*  It's worth it. Here it is, dude. We've got it up. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=101.0s)]
*  Here it is, dude. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=106.0s)]
*  We got one, huh? [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=108.0s)]
*  Here it is. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=110.0s)]
*  Wow, he's good at it. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=112.0s)]
*  Dude, he's sand in the wood with his hands, dude. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=121.0s)]
*  Oh wow. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=124.0s)]
*  My guy is for real, dude. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=125.0s)]
*  He's real. He's an instrument of the Lord, brother. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=127.0s)]
*  Here's my question is, what's the end thing? [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=130.0s)]
*  Like what happens at the end? [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=135.0s)]
*  Like halfway is there a two? Here it is, dude. Dog medicine. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=137.0s)]
*  Oh wow. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=140.0s)]
*  Now what is the dog medicine? What do you think the real function of that medicine is? [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=141.0s)]
*  Here it is. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=145.0s)]
*  Get some, can we get some audio on this guy's hands, dude? [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=146.0s)]
*  Jack us in, brother. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=149.0s)]
*  Jack us into some of this guy's hands. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=150.0s)]
*  Oh wow. So this is a gentleman you can't see him at home, guys. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=153.0s)]
*  This is sort of a Ruben-esque gentleman who is making his hands rougher and then... [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=157.0s)]
*  The sound is hands. It really is, dude. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=163.0s)]
*  And then he just rubs them together. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=166.0s)]
*  He just rubs them together, dude. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=168.0s)]
*  Dude, he will probably be the president in two terms. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=170.0s)]
*  Here he is. He's trying to strike a match, dude. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=174.0s)]
*  And here he is striking a match on his knuckles. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=177.0s)]
*  Now he can strike a match on his feet, which is a feat in and of itself. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=180.0s)]
*  No pun intended. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=186.0s)]
*  That's the start, man. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=187.0s)]
*  It's wild. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=188.0s)]
*  God. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=190.0s)]
*  We had a guy one night that came to his show and he's like, [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=191.0s)]
*  hey man, me and my cousin, we love you and look at him. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=196.0s)]
*  And he goes, he's missing 70% of his skull, right? [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=200.0s)]
*  And the dude had a cool thing though, where if he like put his finger in his mouth and went... [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=203.0s)]
*  Then the other part of his head would kind of show up. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=207.0s)]
*  That happened. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=211.0s)]
*  Yeah, dude. On my Pikeville, Kentucky, brother. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=213.0s)]
*  That is wild, dude. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=216.0s)]
*  You need all your skull to party over there. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=218.0s)]
*  That is wild, dude. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=220.0s)]
*  Dude, people are fascinating, dude. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=222.0s)]
*  Oh, we had a guy, we used to have a really great, I don't want to say homeless guy, [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=224.0s)]
*  but a guy who just kind of hadn't been home probably in a decent amount of time. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=228.0s)]
*  Unhoused. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=234.0s)]
*  Yeah, I would say unhoused. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=235.0s)]
*  I think that's the... Right, yeah. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=236.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=238.0s)]
*  But when he's smiling, he had a couple of his teeth in his hand, [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=240.0s)]
*  I guess they'd fallen out or something. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=242.0s)]
*  And if he was smiling, he would still make the shape and he would show you the teeth. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=244.0s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=248.0s)]
*  So he just had them. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=250.0s)]
*  That was kind of his party trick. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=252.0s)]
*  He's helped me out. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=254.0s)]
*  Like, do you think he's like need money for veneers? [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=256.0s)]
*  Oh, I don't know. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=260.0s)]
*  Now that's the thing. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=262.0s)]
*  Here's the teeth that I need. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=264.0s)]
*  Just for proof. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=266.0s)]
*  I'm actually missing these teeth. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=268.0s)]
*  Just check my work here. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=270.0s)]
*  The people are just interesting. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=272.0s)]
*  I mean, dude, even like the places you'll stay, like I stayed at a place, [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=274.0s)]
*  like sometimes we'll stay at some pretty nice spots and sometimes, you know, it's just... [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=278.0s)]
*  Like an outdoor... When the doors are on the outside, you know that you've arrived at a certain level of establishment. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=283.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's true. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=290.0s)]
*  And there's nowhere to go but down from that. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=291.0s)]
*  That's the top level of that. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=293.0s)]
*  Yes, when there's doors inside. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=295.0s)]
*  And then as the doors get more and more open, [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=297.0s)]
*  I went to... We checked in one. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=301.0s)]
*  It's... God, this had to be six years ago. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=303.0s)]
*  And we just like, you know, we played a show somewhere, Columbia, South Carolina. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=306.0s)]
*  And then we had a show in the Outer Banks the next day. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=310.0s)]
*  This is like van and trailer, no manager. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=313.0s)]
*  It's just me and the band. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=315.0s)]
*  Like, I'm trying to check into the rooms and stuff. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=317.0s)]
*  So we drove from Columbia. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=319.0s)]
*  We were supposed to play a tailgate at Clemson the next morning. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=321.0s)]
*  So we're trying to like get that in, make extra like $800, me and my guitar player, [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=324.0s)]
*  and then get in the van and go play our show. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=328.0s)]
*  So we drive from Columbia to Clemson, a couple hours. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=330.0s)]
*  You know, the show is over at like 11 or 12. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=333.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=335.0s)]
*  So then we get to the damn hotel. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=336.0s)]
*  It's, you know, two in the morning. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=338.0s)]
*  Check in all the rooms. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=340.0s)]
*  I get all the bangers in the rooms. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=342.0s)]
*  And it's one of these doors on the outside. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=344.0s)]
*  And I go to my door. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=346.0s)]
*  Door's open, dude. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=348.0s)]
*  It's already open. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=349.0s)]
*  It's already cracked a little bit. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=351.0s)]
*  This door is already talking shit. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=353.0s)]
*  And the lights are on in the room. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=355.0s)]
*  And I'm like, man, this, this is probably good. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=357.0s)]
*  So pop in that room, dude. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=360.0s)]
*  And there must have, it looked like the cicadas came out of the room. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=362.0s)]
*  Really? [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=366.0s)]
*  It wasn't cicadas. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=367.0s)]
*  It was every bug known to me. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=368.0s)]
*  Because the doors are on the outside. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=370.0s)]
*  It's been open for, since checkout, which is at least 12 hours, dude, [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=372.0s)]
*  with all the lights in the room on. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=378.0s)]
*  Go to the desk and I'm like, hey, I'm an easy guy. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=380.0s)]
*  Yeah, hate to complain. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=384.0s)]
*  But I can't sleep in a room full of bugs. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=385.0s)]
*  And they were like, ooh, we don't have any other rooms. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=388.0s)]
*  That was the last, that's the last room. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=391.0s)]
*  But there's nobody in the parking lot. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=393.0s)]
*  No, there's nobody there. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=395.0s)]
*  Well, it's more of a extended type. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=397.0s)]
*  Oh, I see what you're saying. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=399.0s)]
*  Stay, I would imagine. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=400.0s)]
*  Yeah, if they have a blender in there, that's extended stay. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=402.0s)]
*  When there's anything to cook with, you've reached another level. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=405.0s)]
*  Yeah, another level of hotel. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=409.0s)]
*  Yeah, some hotels, there's one time I remember I called down to the front desk. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=411.0s)]
*  I was like, hey, do you guys have internet? [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=416.0s)]
*  And the guy's like, let me check. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=419.0s)]
*  And I'm like, what? [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=421.0s)]
*  Check? [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=423.0s)]
*  Let me see. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=425.0s)]
*  Hold on, I haven't heard of that. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=426.0s)]
*  I'll get back to you. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=427.0s)]
*  But then I hear him. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=428.0s)]
*  He's actually clicking it up on the computer. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=430.0s)]
*  He goes to Google, do we have internet? [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=432.0s)]
*  Google search. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=435.0s)]
*  It just, dude, one time we stopped in Lexington and I went in to check in and it was kind of during the pandemic. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=436.0s)]
*  So people were kind of on their wits end here and there. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=442.0s)]
*  And you'd see people wearing neck braces for no reason, all types of stuff. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=445.0s)]
*  People didn't know what was going on. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=449.0s)]
*  Yeah, assorted medical devices. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=451.0s)]
*  Yeah, it was very assorted medical. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=453.0s)]
*  And this dude, I go in there and it took him forever, bro. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=455.0s)]
*  He just found out there's a room. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=459.0s)]
*  And I was like, is there anything I can do to expedite this? [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=460.0s)]
*  And he's like, I'm sorry, sir. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=464.0s)]
*  And then he goes, you know, I used to be in a wheelchair. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=466.0s)]
*  And I was like, cool. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=469.0s)]
*  He used to be. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=472.0s)]
*  Well, that's the thing. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=474.0s)]
*  He's not currently in it. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=475.0s)]
*  No. And it wasn't like I was just out of a wheelchair. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=477.0s)]
*  Like work with me here. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=479.0s)]
*  You know, it was just like throwing something from the past. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=481.0s)]
*  Yeah, I had a broken arm at one time. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=484.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's not currently broken, but it was. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=486.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=488.0s)]
*  Excuse me. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=489.0s)]
*  Did he give you any kind of it? [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=490.0s)]
*  So he's making an excuse for just you trying to hurry him up. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=492.0s)]
*  There's no reason to hurry things here. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=497.0s)]
*  He's like, hey, man, give me a fucking break. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=498.0s)]
*  I used to be in a wheelchair. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=500.0s)]
*  I used to be in a wheelchair. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=502.0s)]
*  I used to be in the fifth grade. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=503.0s)]
*  We can't just. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=505.0s)]
*  It doesn't really matter that you used to be. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=508.0s)]
*  Yeah. And keep the chair. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=511.0s)]
*  If you still are in a wheelchair, like if I notice see somebody wheelchair, I'm going to be like, what can I, you know, I'm going to work with you here. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=512.0s)]
*  I'll even, you know, I'll even take a ride with you or whatever. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=518.0s)]
*  But like if there's somebody who's like, yeah, I used to be or, you know, but anyway, nice to see you, man. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=521.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=529.0s)]
*  We fired right into the dog medicine hands guy fast, dude. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=530.0s)]
*  Dude, yeah. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=534.0s)]
*  That's some of that though, stay in different places. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=535.0s)]
*  I mean, it's. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=537.0s)]
*  It's it gets it gets easier to it's easier to rough it when you're younger. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=538.0s)]
*  Dude, for sure. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=544.0s)]
*  Well, once you haven't not roughed it. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=545.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=548.0s)]
*  Like when that's when roughing it is the only experience, which was that's what it was forever, dude. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=549.0s)]
*  I mean, in the van, you know, the 15 passenger van, it's like, oh, yeah, that long ball. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=555.0s)]
*  And the long. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=559.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=560.0s)]
*  Because that's but when we had back roads out and it's all the gear. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=561.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=564.0s)]
*  So it's less than 15 seats. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=565.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=566.0s)]
*  But there's like six guys in there. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=567.0s)]
*  All these amps, guitars like it was a mess, dude. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=569.0s)]
*  It was truly a mess. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=573.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=575.0s)]
*  It's so bad for some people now, though, like I think of like, let's say you're a new artist and you let's say you have a song that blows up on the Internet or whatever. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=576.0s)]
*  And then you're just thrust into like this really like official version of yourself, even if you're maybe not like ready for that. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=585.0s)]
*  Oh, I see what you're saying. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=594.0s)]
*  Even if you just have one or two songs like you can have something blow up so hard online that you have to get a label and all this stuff. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=595.0s)]
*  And you it's not that that's sick, dude. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=602.0s)]
*  I think people have the capability to like to achieve that for themselves now, because that was something that wasn't really achievable up until like maybe seven or eight years ago, I think. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=605.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=615.0s)]
*  You miss so much of like all those good memories from like the road and like when it sucked and like playing bars and nobody's there and all my like favorite stories, man, from like my music career. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=616.0s)]
*  A lot of them are from that time. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=628.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=630.0s)]
*  Like unofficial days, you know what I mean? [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=631.0s)]
*  There's no like an unofficial biography, dude. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=633.0s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=638.0s)]
*  It's like those are the days. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=639.0s)]
*  But I feel like people are missing that a little bit. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=641.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=643.0s)]
*  If you just go right on the tour bus, like there's no strife. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=644.0s)]
*  Like that's all you know. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=647.0s)]
*  It's a good point. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=648.0s)]
*  It's kind of like catch one hit or one like melody that really like catches fire on social media. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=649.0s)]
*  And then you can be opening up for someone. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=655.0s)]
*  For sure. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=658.0s)]
*  And then you go that's your first experience being on the road is I'm in a bus and I play in arenas, which, dude, that would be super sick. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=659.0s)]
*  But still it could set you up for some reality. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=667.0s)]
*  What happens when you start way up here? [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=670.0s)]
*  And not that that's all the way at the top, but if you kick past people that have been doing it for 10 years and then all of a sudden you're because like in country, there's a lot of these like guitar pools and stuff where you like, like let's say there's three or four of us up here. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=674.0s)]
*  We're all new artists. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=687.0s)]
*  We're all playing for this radio station thing, whatever. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=688.0s)]
*  It's like, let's say one of those guys makes it to the thing. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=691.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=694.0s)]
*  Well, let me let me just paint an example of what could happen. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=695.0s)]
*  You're a new guy or gal and you have a song that blows up and that's sick, dude. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=698.0s)]
*  I'm pumped for anybody that that happens to. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=703.0s)]
*  But all of a sudden you're at the same level of let's say in in the vacuum of this story, the new artist that you're up there with is Chris Stapleton. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=705.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=715.0s)]
*  And then you're sitting up there. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=716.0s)]
*  You've maybe have never met anybody you're playing with. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=717.0s)]
*  And they're like, all right, man, this Chris guy's going to go first and then you'll play a song after him, dude. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=720.0s)]
*  And he fires into just the most singing ass guitar playing ass thing you've ever heard. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=725.0s)]
*  The guys played a thousand shows, dude. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=731.0s)]
*  And you're up there going, I got to play after this. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=734.0s)]
*  And I have to do it five more times in front of all these people. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=739.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=742.0s)]
*  And he's going to just blow the doors off. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=743.0s)]
*  It's like you've entered your Honda Civic that won a race in your neighborhood against the guy driving a NASCAR. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=745.0s)]
*  It's like it's so hard to compete against that. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=752.0s)]
*  Yeah, dude. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=755.0s)]
*  Oh, no doubt. And your song has a dance that goes with it. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=756.0s)]
*  And it's acoustic. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=760.0s)]
*  So the version where the dance is cool is not even the one you get to play because it's just you and like some guy that plays guitar. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=761.0s)]
*  You met at a coffee shop. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=768.0s)]
*  But do you think, though, it could be a sign of like the way that things will will be? [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=770.0s)]
*  I remember when like because they're started. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=776.0s)]
*  I remember when vloggers came out, right? [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=778.0s)]
*  Yep. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=780.0s)]
*  And there were people vlogging, not even know what was going on and people and it was like people were trashing it. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=781.0s)]
*  Yeah, people would. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=786.0s)]
*  People would trash it for sure. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=787.0s)]
*  But you know, but those guys would sell out. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=788.0s)]
*  The vloggers would sell out comedy clubs like around the country, like people would come and they would do some kind of Q&A with their fans. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=791.0s)]
*  And so that kind of came out of nowhere. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=798.0s)]
*  And then I just wonder, like if the future is more. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=801.0s)]
*  You know, right. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=807.0s)]
*  Like instant success. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=808.0s)]
*  Right. And no judgment of it. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=809.0s)]
*  No, I mean, it's just the sign of the times. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=811.0s)]
*  I think just from, you know, maybe in 30 years or whatever, that's like you're saying, that's the only way it happens. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=813.0s)]
*  Right. That's what I'm wondering. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=820.0s)]
*  I wonder if things just evolve where that's the only way. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=821.0s)]
*  But eventually, like that thing will be monopolized by somebody like somebody will figure that out. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=823.0s)]
*  That's it's probably already happening in some ways, either the powers that be, whatever you call it. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=830.0s)]
*  We'll figure out some way to make this thing. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=836.0s)]
*  OK, here's the formula for how you do this and how you break this. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=839.0s)]
*  That's probably already happening a lot, to be honest. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=842.0s)]
*  And here's how we do. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=844.0s)]
*  We got a new guy. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=846.0s)]
*  He looks fucking really cool. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=847.0s)]
*  So here's this cool song and then go sing this cool song and that's cool. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=849.0s)]
*  And then they're like, great. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=854.0s)]
*  And that guy's already signed his deal. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=855.0s)]
*  Yeah. And everybody thinks, you know, what's the thing that people with the conspiracy theories? [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=857.0s)]
*  Oh, that guy's an industry plan. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=861.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah, that's like that's not a big thing. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=863.0s)]
*  I don't think, dude, like I don't think that's a thing, especially in like if you're like in a look at like real country culture, like industry people would notice anybody that can button the button. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=866.0s)]
*  They're sure to correct first. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=878.0s)]
*  They'd be like, this guy is something. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=881.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah. Yeah. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=883.0s)]
*  Oh, dude, is our neighborhood. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=884.0s)]
*  Yeah. If somebody had gasoline, people like, look at this. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=885.0s)]
*  They're like, look at this guy with his car over here. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=890.0s)]
*  It's like, oh, you're working for the cops. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=893.0s)]
*  That was the biggest thing when I was growing up was always accusing people of being narcs. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=895.0s)]
*  Somebody would get a new pair of shoes and be like, yeah, Ronnie's a fucking narc. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=898.0s)]
*  He's working with the man. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=903.0s)]
*  He's obviously an informant. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=905.0s)]
*  This guy, but the man, it's definitely going to be. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=907.0s)]
*  But then it's like, where does it always wonder where does it progress from there? [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=913.0s)]
*  Like, where do you like when that's the new thing? [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=916.0s)]
*  What's the next new thing? [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=919.0s)]
*  There'll always be another like version of like what's the way to your path to like, right, achieving your music dreams or or your comedy dreams or whatever it may be. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=920.0s)]
*  Like the path is ever evolving. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=932.0s)]
*  Yeah. Like I think really the first the first guy that in country music that use social media to his advantage was like Kane Brown and like probably me. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=933.0s)]
*  Yeah. Like the first guys that like came to Nashville, we had kind of our own fans going on, like the Internet helped us get fans. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=946.0s)]
*  And then we came to town. It was like, well, these guys already got stuff going on. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=954.0s)]
*  So I'm in no way like shaming anybody that does that because I was the first one of the first guys that like and I didn't even know I was doing it. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=957.0s)]
*  Like I was now people are probably smart enough to like they're doing that because they're smart. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=966.0s)]
*  I was just doing it because I was like, oh, well, this will kind of like I was like, you know what I'm going to do is get all these followers and sell them my songs. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=971.0s)]
*  Like there was never that. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=980.0s)]
*  Well, you started on Vine, right? [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=981.0s)]
*  You started was at the social media platform. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=982.0s)]
*  Yeah. And that's the thing, too. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=984.0s)]
*  It's like, yeah, you don't know where the next social media platform is going to come. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=985.0s)]
*  This is a crazy thing. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=988.0s)]
*  There's a lot of artists out there like, man, maybe I don't find my way with this social media platform, but there could be one about to be invented. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=990.0s)]
*  That's going to be the one that's the next. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=997.0s)]
*  There's always something because what does it start with? [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=999.0s)]
*  It starts with my space, right? [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=1001.0s)]
*  My space, Facebook, Instagram. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=1004.0s)]
*  Do you remember they also had like friends to that some other weird things that know tick tock? [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=1007.0s)]
*  No, tick tock wasn't it musical Kali musically. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=1011.0s)]
*  It was before only where people would like lip sync to songs. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=1015.0s)]
*  That was the only thing I remember seeing. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=1019.0s)]
*  And I was like, man, this is a weird platform. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=1021.0s)]
*  And they rebranded and it was the hugest thing ever. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=1024.0s)]
*  Oh, wait, was that where people do duets together? [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=1027.0s)]
*  Yeah, no way. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=1029.0s)]
*  That was tick tock. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=1030.0s)]
*  That was the original version of tick tock was that thing. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=1031.0s)]
*  I think I had like a secret account there, like a fence account or whatever. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=1035.0s)]
*  And I would go and do these duets with these Japanese people. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=1038.0s)]
*  It's a lot of Asian singers on there and they would do it. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=1041.0s)]
*  There was always duets you can do at any time of the day with people from around the world. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=1045.0s)]
*  Yep. Yep. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=1050.0s)]
*  I mean, that's invaluable. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=1051.0s)]
*  Yeah. Music musical dot L Y musically. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=1053.0s)]
*  Oh, that's a horrible name. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=1056.0s)]
*  So they so they so they merged. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=1057.0s)]
*  So tick tock was another I guess its own company. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=1060.0s)]
*  Yeah. When you have a B flat or whatever that is in your word of your name, that's I'm out. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=1064.0s)]
*  Yeah. Not great marketing there, dude. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=1071.0s)]
*  You know, I didn't know that was. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=1074.0s)]
*  Yeah. Because I remember when it counts like, man, this is like brutal, dude. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=1077.0s)]
*  This is not going to be they figured something out, dude. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=1080.0s)]
*  For anybody who had the app already musically, it just became tick tock. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=1083.0s)]
*  Like, I remember it was an old app on my phone. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=1087.0s)]
*  He had it, dude. He was ripping. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=1089.0s)]
*  You were ripping duets, dude. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=1092.0s)]
*  Pull up some of your duets. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=1094.0s)]
*  This guy's been vaping all day. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=1096.0s)]
*  Let's get those. Let's be popcorn long in there, dude. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=1098.0s)]
*  He's. Well, now is it hard to make more? [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=1101.0s)]
*  Is it hard? Like once you've had you've had you've been real fortunate and had a great career, right? [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=1110.0s)]
*  The luckiest dude ever. Yeah. Yeah. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=1115.0s)]
*  And I mean like that. I feel I feel that way. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=1117.0s)]
*  Anybody who gets. Yeah. It's like you get obviously there's a lot of good fortune is going your way. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=1121.0s)]
*  But I've dude, I've thought this a million times. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=1125.0s)]
*  I thought before my last record come out before the one before that came out, I'm like, dude, this is like the best I'll ever be, dude. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=1127.0s)]
*  And like everything I do from here on, it's just going to be bad. Yeah. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=1135.0s)]
*  And it's like, I don't know why. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=1138.0s)]
*  Like it's human nature to some extent. Maybe. Yeah, I think so. Yeah, that seems normal. [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=1140.0s)]
*  Like because then like when I put my last record out and then fast car thing happened, like that was so unexpected. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=1145.0s)]
*  Like it was not never in a million years. [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=1151.0s)]
*  And I think what will be the biggest song of your whole career? [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=1153.0s)]
*  Definitely wouldn't have cover a fast car would not have been on the list. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=1156.0s)]
*  Yeah, not because I didn't love that song, but like I really recorded it on kind of a whim because we had some extra time in the studio. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=1160.0s)]
*  Yeah. And so sometimes those decisions can be the best decisions, you know. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=1166.0s)]
*  But I do think I'm like, man, well, you know, I mean, I'm sitting here right now and I could tell you that today I've at some point molded over my what's what happens next for what's my next thing. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=1171.0s)]
*  And God's like, nobody cares, dude. [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=1182.0s)]
*  And if I don't do this thing, then nobody's going to listen. [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=1184.0s)]
*  And I was like, bro, I'm going to be playing for one hundred and twenty thousand people this weekend. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=1187.0s)]
*  And I'm still going. Well, nobody cares, dude. [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=1192.0s)]
*  Nobody wants to do any see me or anything. [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=1195.0s)]
*  And it's just like I have to like remind myself all the time of like if I try to have this conversation with myself is if if I had the thought processes that I go over with myself in my head now, if I had them. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=1198.0s)]
*  So if I had them with myself 10 years ago, what would myself 10 years ago say? [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=1210.0s)]
*  Because this will be my 10th year in Nashville in September. [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=1216.0s)]
*  I see. And so I go, man, well, I, you know, nobody, nobody cares if I post this Instagram story and it only gets only one hundred and ninety thousand people. [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=1219.0s)]
*  And fifty thousand people liked it, which is insane. [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=1228.0s)]
*  And it's insane thought process. Oh, yeah. [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=1231.0s)]

*  And I'm like, and if you feel like it wasn't, then suddenly you're 10 years ago, one hundred and fifty thousand people had never even heard of me before. [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=1241.0s)]

*  I remember I went to oh, Marilyn Manson was the first show that I ever went to. [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=1331.0s)]
*  What was that like? It was scary, dude. How old were you? [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=1338.0s)]
*  I was 16. They played in a bar. Oh, maybe I was 15, 15 or 16 around there. [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=1343.0s)]
*  You say they like the band or yeah, like is there a band? Is it like oh, is Marilyn Manson? [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=1348.0s)]
*  Is it just him? No, it's he has. So there's a band and stuff like I've never like I've never seen the show. [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=1354.0s)]
*  Yeah. Is there a band? Yeah. Like you can't really think of like somebody being behind that guy with a trumpet. [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=1358.0s)]
*  Right. Like like a march, like a drum line. Yeah. Yeah. Interesting. Who'd they have? They had Twiggy Ramirez. [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=1365.0s)]
*  They I don't know who's still in it. Oh, so this is like there's a whole there's kind of a persona to the band as well. [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=1371.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah. The whole band was I think semi-deceased or whatever is what they were going for. [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=1380.0s)]
*  Semi-deceased. Another great band. By the way, we got to trademark all these, dude. Semi-deceased. Open for chainmail, chainmail children. [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=1385.0s)]
*  Oh, that happens, dude. And there's mosh pit training if you show up a half hour early, bro. [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=1393.0s)]
*  That was the best. Safety training. How to stay safe in the mosh pit. [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=1400.0s)]
*  Dude, my buddy used to referee mosh pits and he would give him like 50 bucks a night or something. [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=1404.0s)]
*  Wait. So is there a penalties? Like, is there laundry on the field? Like, is he like beep beep beep? [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=1409.0s)]
*  But hold on, dude. You hit that guy improperly. Improper. Is it like a bouncer situation? [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=1417.0s)]
*  Yeah, he's just like he was the guy that's like but he wasn't like, don't hurt this guy. He was like, just don't call on the stage. [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=1424.0s)]
*  No, he was away from the state. No, he was like once the mosh pit got going, he would kind of cruise in and out of it. [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=1432.0s)]
*  Kind of like keeping things cool. Whistle. Sometimes a little flashlight. [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=1438.0s)]
*  It'd be sick to have a guy in there that's just like you get a couple like lesser known UFC guys and you just kind of put them in the crowd. [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=1443.0s)]
*  And you're like, dude, just wreck people. You know, I'm like if some guys out of hand, just just just flatline this dude. [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=1452.0s)]
*  Right. Yeah. Everybody. Everyone's like, man, we should chill a little bit. [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=1459.0s)]
*  You know, just make you just become your own policeman. Yeah, this is it. [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=1462.0s)]
*  Okay. That guy didn't like some of the other guys behavior. [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=1466.0s)]
*  So that guy was in theory what your friend was what I just said. Yep. [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=1469.0s)]
*  You go in and just jaw guy and make an example of somebody. I love that dude. What a gig dude. [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=1474.0s)]
*  Fifty dollars. That seems underpaid. I think yeah, we probably they might have been some some fiscal discrepancies. [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=1480.0s)]
*  You know, I've had some bad habits and I've tried to kick them and some some sometimes I'll go a few weeks and I'm doing well and sometimes I have a setback. [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=1490.0s)]
*  You know, and it's it's true that 73 percent of Americans have a bad habit or behavior that that they find unhealthy. [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=1499.0s)]
*  Well, fortunately, there is fume. That's right. [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=1509.0s)]
*  That's right. Fume works through a passive diffusion system that uses no electronics, vapor or combustion, just natural oils. [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=1513.0s)]
*  So you can use it outdoors and indoors as well. I like my fume. [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=1522.0s)]
*  It kind of occupies my mind, occupies my time, helps me get over cravings. [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=1528.0s)]
*  It's really good if you're a nervous fidgeter because it comes with a calming anxiety magnet sort of contraption that just takes your mind off of things for a second. [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=1533.0s)]
*  It looks pretty awesome, too. It's kind of timeless looking, kind of old and new. [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=1542.0s)]
*  It's free of toxins. It's totally safe and has no nicotine in it. [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=1547.0s)]
*  That's right. Fume is not a vape. No vapor. You can use it anywhere. [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=1551.0s)]
*  No nicotine. It's not addictive. Non toxic flavors. [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=1555.0s)]
*  It's a guilt free alternative. It's its own thing. [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=1559.0s)]
*  And it's given me the best chance at battling my bad habits. [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=1563.0s)]
*  So to start your journey with the good habit and get a free gift with your journey pack, which includes a fume device, three core flavors of your choice and a cleaning kit, go to try fume. [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=1568.0s)]

*  Yeah, that's wild. [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=1678.0s)]
*  It's crazy to like, for the sake of what it is, not having really talked about it at all really. [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=1680.0s)]
*  When you put out a new album, how tough is it to like, because you know what your fans like, [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=1689.0s)]
*  kind of are people that come to see you have a general idea. [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=1697.0s)]
*  And then is it spooky to like try and change that, but also evolve for yourself? [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=1700.0s)]
*  And then like, who am I even becoming? Like that sort of thing? [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=1705.0s)]
*  Yeah, man. I think about that a lot, you know, going back to when we were talking a little bit ago, [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=1708.0s)]
*  like what do you think about yourself or your career? What's next? [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=1712.0s)]
*  And it's I've always I've always said this to myself was like, I want to like grow up with my fan base. [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=1716.0s)]
*  Like, you know, somebody that listened to me that's been a fan of me. [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=1723.0s)]
*  Well, maybe it's been 10 years, dude. I mean, I'm 34. [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=1726.0s)]
*  So when I was 24, I just moved to Nashville. I did have some fans, not a lot, but some. [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=1729.0s)]
*  And I meet people like, dude, I was a fan, been a fan since the Vine days, dude. [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=1734.0s)]
*  You know, like I still meet people that say that. [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=1737.0s)]
*  And so if you were a fan of mine, then let's say you were even if you were 18. [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=1740.0s)]
*  So you were six years younger than me. Well, now you're you're not 18 anymore. [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=1745.0s)]
*  You're 28. You know, you could be 28. You could be married with kids, whatever it is like, you know. [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=1750.0s)]
*  And there's a huge part of me that that I worry like, well, will I age myself out? [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=1755.0s)]
*  Like, am I does anybody even want to hear songs about being a dad or whatever? [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=1761.0s)]
*  And it's like. I hope so. [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=1766.0s)]
*  But like, I also I don't want to, you know, I feel like I could go get with, you know, [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=1769.0s)]
*  I'm not the world's best writer, but I'm lucky to be friends with a lot of guys that are, I feel like. [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=1776.0s)]
*  And so I could go get in a room with them and write, you know, something like Bearer Broke My Heart or, [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=1781.0s)]
*  you know, When It Rains It Pours. [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=1787.0s)]
*  Like, I could try to recreate that time and time again. [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=1789.0s)]
*  And I sometimes I like I want to do that because I selfishly I'm like, well, that would make me this [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=1792.0s)]
*  or that would give me another big song or whatever. [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=1799.0s)]
*  But it's like I've just been, you know, like I said, I've got I've got two boys that are under two years old, man. [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=1802.0s)]
*  So like my life is dominated by the thoughts of like being there for them. [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=1808.0s)]
*  And like, you know, I want to be their dad first. [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=1814.0s)]
*  And so I had to like write this. [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=1817.0s)]
*  I had to do this project because it's the only thing that's been on my mind. [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=1821.0s)]
*  Like when I go get in the writing room and someone's like, man, let's write something fun, dude. [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=1824.0s)]
*  And I'm like, I'm going to be writing this up tempo thing. [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=1830.0s)]
*  And it's like it's hard to like get in that mindset because all the things I'm doing is like, dude, like grilling dogs and like, yeah, like playing in the kiddie pool. [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=1833.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=1842.0s)]
*  But it's hard to like get in that like the mindset of like, you know, yeah, you can't have tickled that kiddo and have it be, you know, [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=1843.0s)]
*  Chainmail children. [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=1851.0s)]
*  That's one of their songs. [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=1852.0s)]
*  Look, yeah. [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=1853.0s)]
*  And this is going to turn into fundraiser for kids who have been abused. [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=1854.0s)]
*  But it's funny that you say some of that because I sat one one day I was sitting with this guy owns a management company for comedians. [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=1859.0s)]
*  They own probably the biggest management company. [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=1868.0s)]
*  And he was saying, well, you want to grow up with your fan base, you know, you have to because they're going to evolve. [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=1870.0s)]
*  You just stay like this, like not stay, but if you're kind of a, you know, they, they, if you fail to evolve, then you're just, you're not going to become stale. [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=1876.0s)]
*  Yeah. It's like it just becomes, okay, man, well, I've, you know, I mean, except for the one guy that's eating 10,000 Big Macs or whatever it is, you can't eat it every meal, dude. [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=1887.0s)]
*  I mean, not that they're not good. [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=1897.0s)]
*  Yeah. But you want a little something like the menus got to expand a little bit. [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=1899.0s)]
*  Yeah. And not that you can't come back to the classics at some point. [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=1903.0s)]
*  Oh yeah. My mother would always get a McFish. I remember McFish and it, it always is that the pre-Falaya fish. [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=1907.0s)]
*  The second she ordered it. I was like, I don't even know her anymore. [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=1916.0s)]
*  McFish. [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=1919.0s)]
*  Isn't that crazy? Yeah. I didn't know they had it. She did it to kind of be like, she was evolving with her fan base. [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=1920.0s)]
*  She was like, we were learning new stuff. [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=1926.0s)]
*  Yeah. You're learning new, you know, flavor of the week dude. He's a McFish guy. You know what I mean? [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=1931.0s)]
*  But she would like get us to be quiet and then she would order the McFish and I'll be like, nobody cares if we're loud while you order it. [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=1937.0s)]
*  It's not going to make us any not poor. [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=1947.0s)]
*  It's not going to make us. [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=1950.0s)]
*  The people at the window will think we have class if you guys aren't screaming while I order this McFish. You know what I mean? [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=1952.0s)]
*  That right there, Luke, that is exactly who my mother is. That is exactly who she is. I've never been able to put it into words. [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=1958.0s)]
*  You damn kid shut the hell up. Let me work McFish right now. And it's like little. [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=1966.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=1971.0s)]
*  Little Theodore will have a, he'll have a junior children's meal. [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=1972.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=1977.0s)]
*  And I'll have, she would get everybody. [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=1978.0s)]
*  She's definitely not a shit ass who stole a bike last week for sure. [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=1981.0s)]
*  And I'll have a McFish. [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=1985.0s)]
*  Like that was the class. [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=1988.0s)]
*  They're like, now is that wild caught or is it farm raised? [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=1991.0s)]
*  I'll take blackened, the blackened McFish. [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=1996.0s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. Blackened. [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=2000.0s)]
*  Oh, it's wild caught dude. It says no chance dude. [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=2004.0s)]
*  That it's wild. [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=2010.0s)]
*  There is no chance. [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=2012.0s)]
*  Well, Luke, now give them their chance. [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=2014.0s)]
*  Look, Luke, this is probably legitimate information. They have a JPEG with it. [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=2017.0s)]
*  Our fish sandwich recipe features a crispy fish filet patty. [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=2021.0s)]
*  That's the interest. [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=2026.0s)]
*  Filet patty is a weird term. [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=2027.0s)]
*  Filet patty, complete contradiction dude right there. [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=2029.0s)]
*  That's like saying, dude, this ribeye steak, that's now a hamburger though. [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=2033.0s)]
*  But it was a ribeye steak at one point. [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=2037.0s)]
*  Yeah, this filet McNugget is really up to no good. [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=2040.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=2044.0s)]
*  It says wild caught Alaskan pollock on melty American cheese and it's topped with creamy McDonald's tartar sauce. [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=2045.0s)]
*  Wow. [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=2051.0s)]
*  Next guest for the show needs to be a guy that works on the McDonald's fishing vessel. [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=2052.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=2057.0s)]
*  How do like because we need a little bit of the McCaptain. [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=2058.0s)]
*  The McSkipper dude. [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=2061.0s)]
*  We need the McSkipper. [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=2064.0s)]
*  We should get to the bottom of. [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=2066.0s)]
*  Is it really like, can we find the guy that caught my filet fish dude, my McFish? [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=2071.0s)]
*  He's out there dude. [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=2077.0s)]
*  He's out there. He's in Alaska right now, dude. [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=2079.0s)]
*  I don't know if he's in Alaska. [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=2082.0s)]
*  The salty dog dude that caught that McFish dude is out there. [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=2083.0s)]
*  I don't believe that the guy's ever been to Alaska. [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=2088.0s)]
*  Wild caught dude, wild caught though. [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=2092.0s)]
*  That's the part I'm not sure of. [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=2096.0s)]
*  I don't even know what we've talked about so far. [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=2097.0s)]
*  But it's about father and son. [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=2099.0s)]
*  I know you have some new children, right? [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=2100.0s)]
*  Yep. [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=2102.0s)]
*  And I know your family moved here. [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=2103.0s)]
*  I remember hearing you talk before on Joe Rogan that your family had moved to Nashville. [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=2109.0s)]
*  To town. [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=2114.0s)]
*  How's that been? [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=2115.0s)]
*  It's been awesome. [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=2116.0s)]
*  I mean it's been an adjustment for them. [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=2117.0s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=2119.0s)]
*  Most of my life lived in Asheville, North Carolina. [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=2120.0s)]
*  It's fun with the Orange Peel. [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=2124.0s)]
*  We played there before. [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=2125.0s)]
*  Love the Orange Peel man. [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=2126.0s)]
*  It's a great place. [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=2127.0s)]
*  That whole town is just, and also the hillside. [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=2128.0s)]
*  You could like just roll off of a building and end up in a damn different county almost. [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=2130.0s)]
*  Yeah, you could dude. [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=2135.0s)]
*  But it was an adjustment period for especially my dad. [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=2137.0s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=2141.0s)]
*  Like I mean all his buddies live there. [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=2142.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=2144.0s)]
*  You know but it's, I remember a buddy of mine telling me, you know I think it's just, you [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=2145.0s)]
*  know it's the, like this whole dad's project is just all these different thought processes [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=2151.0s)]
*  that happen with, you know excuse me, the way my dad sees things and the way that I [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=2156.0s)]
*  see things now and the way I see things maybe what was his perspective when he was doing [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=2163.0s)]
*  this with me or you know what are my kids going to think about me or how am I going [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=2168.0s)]
*  to be remembered by them? [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=2173.0s)]
*  And I remember a friend of mine who wrote on this project with me, he was telling me [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=2174.0s)]
*  it was his dad's 70th birthday recently and he called his dad and he was like well you [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=2179.0s)]
*  know man how's it feel? [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=2186.0s)]
*  You know and he said well ain't no way around it pal, this is the ninth inning. [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=2187.0s)]
*  And I just remember being like God, like what a thought, like what a like. [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=2192.0s)]
*  Damn. [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=2197.0s)]
*  And it was just like I remember like ever, I've never forgot that quote because you know [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=2198.0s)]
*  I think that a lot of the struggles that you know my dad had to come in here or it was [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=2204.0s)]
*  a combination of like okay well he's moving on from, you know they lived in Asheville [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=2211.0s)]
*  for 25 some years dude in the same house. [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=2215.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=2217.0s)]
*  And all these memories that are left behind and friends that are left behind and everything [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=2218.0s)]
*  that you know has changed and then also coming to terms with the fact that you yourself are [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=2223.0s)]
*  aging and kind of like maybe that fear of what's next or you know how long do you have, [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=2229.0s)]
*  like I can't imagine what that process is like but that quote stuck with me. [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=2235.0s)]
*  Did your relationship with your dad change after you had boys, you have two boys? [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=2239.0s)]
*  I have two boys, yeah. [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=2243.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=2244.0s)]
*  And yeah man it became, you know I had a lot more, I had a lot more understanding and [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=2245.0s)]
*  grace for you know decisions that he made or you know things that maybe I did that I [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=2252.0s)]
*  didn't understand well why is he upset about this thing or why would this make him upset. [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=2259.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=2264.0s)]
*  You know and I've had friends in the last couple years that have lost their dads and [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=2265.0s)]
*  watching them go through that and it's just all, it's just this constant theme of like [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=2269.0s)]
*  that's where we are in life like we're at this weird like kind of turnover point where [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=2273.0s)]
*  like people begin to lose their parents and then you are, like soon you will be the oldest [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=2278.0s)]
*  man in your family. [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=2284.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=2286.0s)]
*  Which is a scary thought even though I'm only 34 but like you're like okay well if I'm [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=2287.0s)]
*  40 am I like, I'm the oldest generation of maybe man that my children will know? [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=2293.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=2299.0s)]
*  Hopefully. [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=2300.0s)]
*  It's a weird thought. [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=2301.0s)]
*  You know it's just like it's a strange. [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=2302.0s)]
*  Oh yeah dude. [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=2304.0s)]
*  It's a strange time for sure in a good way but it's just. [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=2305.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=2308.0s)]
*  Yeah there's so many little phases you go through like you know you could be a son, [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=2309.0s)]
*  a brother, an uncle, a dad, a grandpa you know there's all like these little roles and [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=2313.0s)]
*  stuff that you have. [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=2319.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=2320.0s)]
*  And yeah getting older like almost all my friends have children except me I was like [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=2321.0s)]
*  I got to get some damn children but you can't just be yelling that off your back porch you [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=2325.0s)]
*  know. [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=2329.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=2330.0s)]
*  And you can't actually have a game plan too and get a spouse. [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=2331.0s)]
*  That would be a good strategy for sure. [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=2334.0s)]
*  It would be a good start for sure you know. [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=2336.0s)]
*  It would be a good start. [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=2339.0s)]
*  Good jumping off point I think you know. [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=2341.0s)]
*  What were some of the songs I listened to? [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=2344.0s)]
*  Front Door Famous. [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=2346.0s)]
*  That's awesome. [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=2347.0s)]
*  Yeah I love that. [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=2348.0s)]
*  That one made me really like feel something you know. [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=2349.0s)]
*  Yeah I love the whole thing man. [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=2352.0s)]
*  It turned out we could you know I cut the record live so it was just like we just cut [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=2354.0s)]
*  it on the floor like me two different sessions one evening we cut five songs the other evening [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=2359.0s)]
*  we cut seven. [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=2364.0s)]
*  And so when you say cut it live like what does that term mean? [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=2365.0s)]
*  So like we would just like well let's say we're in a room like this and it's almost [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=2367.0s)]
*  set up like a show in the studio and then they just hit record and play the whole thing [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=2372.0s)]
*  down and like that's what you're hearing. [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=2377.0s)]
*  We did that twice for each song and then they went okay well this one's better than the [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=2379.0s)]
*  other one so that's the one we're using. [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=2383.0s)]
*  That's it. [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=2385.0s)]
*  There's no like when we normally make a record you know it's not it's more of a timed. [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=2386.0s)]
*  So like I think you'd have to fact check me on this but like I don't think in some ways [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=2392.0s)]
*  that Stapleton gets the credit he deserves because he records all of his records like [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=2397.0s)]
*  that. [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=2401.0s)]
*  Wow. [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=2402.0s)]
*  And it's so hard to do that dude like you have to be the artist has to be so dialed [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=2403.0s)]
*  in. [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=2408.0s)]
*  Obviously the musicians are unbelievable anyways. [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=2409.0s)]
*  Like those guys. [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=2411.0s)]
*  It's just one take that's it. [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=2412.0s)]
*  Or and if you mess up it's like well we got to do another take now. [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=2414.0s)]
*  It's not like right. [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=2417.0s)]
*  There's no stopping and starting. [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=2418.0s)]
*  There's no mixing and matching. [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=2419.0s)]
*  There's no mixing and matching. [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=2421.0s)]
*  It's all just top to bottom like you know and I would do every record if I could like [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=2422.0s)]
*  that. [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=2428.0s)]
*  I enjoyed that process so much because like the stakes feel high you know. [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=2429.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=2432.0s)]
*  Feels like it means something. [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=2433.0s)]
*  Like hey man like I got to like bring something to this take dude like it's not another sing [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=2434.0s)]
*  this line six times and then if you. [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=2439.0s)]
*  Package it together. [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=2441.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=2442.0s)]
*  It separates and a lot dude and I'm not I mean with the Stapletons of the world like [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=2443.0s)]
*  it separates the you know the strong from the weak like if every record had to be recorded [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=2446.44s)]
*  like that a lot of your favorite artists would not be recorded. [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=2452.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=2455.48s)]
*  You know what I'm saying. [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=2456.48s)]
*  Like it just it takes such a level of talent and I'm not saying that I have that. [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=2457.48s)]
*  I don't want to sound like that. [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=2461.8s)]
*  But when you look at the other world and the other people that do that and I mean the studio [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=2463.04s)]
*  musicians deserve so much credit dude. [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=2468.04s)]
*  I mean those guys are wicked dude. [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=2470.24s)]
*  I mean it is unreal how good those guys are man. [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=2471.96s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=2474.68s)]
*  Such an appreciated. [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=2475.68s)]
*  I've never been a studio musician but it looks insanely hard. [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=2476.68s)]
*  It's really it's a lot of the best people in the world really. [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=2480.4s)]
*  I would say yeah a lot of the best musicians in the world live in Nashville. [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=2483.96s)]
*  I mean without a doubt and not just country singers we're talking bass players guitar [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=2488.28s)]
*  players drummers and it's like a lot of them are guys that unless you live in that super [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=2492.52s)]
*  niche community like you've never heard of. [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=2497.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=2500.4s)]
*  The best drummers in the world you've never heard of them but they play on every record [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=2501.84s)]
*  that you've ever listened to. [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=2504.44s)]
*  I know it's kind of wild. [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=2505.6s)]
*  It's really kind of wild the limitedness that we usually know about like the people on stage [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=2507.36s)]
*  a lot of times. [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=2511.7200000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=2512.7200000000003s)]
*  Like the behind the scenes guys dude and even like my guys in my band like they're not even [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=2513.7200000000003s)]
*  the guys playing on the record. [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=2516.96s)]
*  What? [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=2518.92s)]
*  Oh because you use a different group to session players are a whole different thing than the [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=2519.92s)]
*  studio guys. [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=2525.2400000000002s)]
*  Not that those guys couldn't be both. [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=2526.2400000000002s)]
*  Right. [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=2527.8s)]
*  But most of the best session players are just session players. [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=2529.0800000000004s)]
*  I mean they go into there I'm talking you would just blow your mind like your favorite [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=2532.0s)]
*  drummer's favorite drummer is a session player. [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=2537.92s)]
*  Your favorite bass player's favorite bass player is a session player like and those [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=2541.44s)]
*  guys are just under thought of like if you go looked at the credits of any country album [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=2545.32s)]
*  for the last 10 years like who's playing fiddle or who's playing dobro it's the same three [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=2550.44s)]
*  four cats any instrument. [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=2556.2s)]
*  I mean there's three four guys of any instrument that's like that's the guy you call or that's [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=2559.04s)]
*  the girl you call. [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=2562.16s)]
*  There was probably year round doing it huh. [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=2563.16s)]
*  Every day they're doing it every day. [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=2565.04s)]
*  God. [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=2566.8799999999997s)]
*  I mean we should have gotten into a different trade. [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=2567.8799999999997s)]
*  Those guys are there. [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=2571.3999999999996s)]
*  They're wild man. [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=2572.68s)]
*  That's what I'm thinking about. [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=2573.68s)]
*  So good dude. [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=2574.7599999999998s)]
*  Yes. [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=2575.7599999999998s)]
*  Yeah I guess being like a parent it's like you get to see like where all your parents [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=2576.7599999999998s)]
*  like just things that they didn't do or that they couldn't do it makes a lot more sense. [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=2580.7999999999997s)]
*  Yeah I mean there's so many things where you go you know you think when you're a kid right [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=2584.48s)]
*  or my mom or my dad did this thing and I would never do that. [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=2589.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=2592.6800000000003s)]
*  I wouldn't ever do that to my kids or whatever and you know sometimes those things end up [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=2593.6800000000003s)]
*  being like yeah man I still would never do that. [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=2598.0800000000004s)]
*  Sometimes you go oh now I get. [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=2600.32s)]
*  While we had to do that. [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=2602.6400000000003s)]
*  Why they did that thing it makes a lot of sense now like it to me it unlocks this some [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=2603.6400000000003s)]
*  at least for me it did you know it unlocks some part of your brain that's inaccessible [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=2610.24s)]
*  in some ways. [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=2614.92s)]
*  Like once the kid that's happened dude it's this whole new level of like caring about [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=2616.56s)]
*  something or loving something that's like you know it's not the same way you love your [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=2622.12s)]
*  wife or your husband or whoever you love. [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=2626.4s)]
*  It's a different kind of thing. [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=2628.44s)]
*  And you were shocked it was that new huh. [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=2630.92s)]
*  Yes dude it was just like you know because you hear like a whole new chord or something. [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=2632.92s)]
*  Yeah like all those cliches dude about well you wait to how fast it goes and you know [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=2636.7599999999998s)]
*  yes you're going to find out like all that cheesy shit. [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=2642.68s)]
*  It's so true. [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=2646.48s)]
*  It's all true dude like all that stuff makes so much sense like when all their cliches [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=2647.48s)]
*  because they people say all the time because they're true. [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=2653.92s)]
*  And it really is it's really been a wild experience. [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=2657.2799999999997s)]
*  The juxtaposition too is weird like because I'm on this tour right now and you know people [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=2659.84s)]
*  are like and it's no fault to anybody but they a lot of people don't really know what [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=2664.36s)]
*  touring is like so they kind of assume like what is it. [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=2670.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=2675.4s)]
*  You ever see your kids you must be gone all the time and I'm home more days a week than [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=2676.4s)]
*  I'm gone or the same amount. [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=2681.4s)]
*  Right. [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=2683.48s)]
*  Like I'm home like three and a half days a week I'm gone like three and a half days a [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=2684.48s)]
*  week. [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=2686.8s)]
*  So that's more than most people that work 40 hours a day get to spend. [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=2687.8s)]
*  That's a good point. [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=2691.92s)]
*  At home with their kids. [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=2692.92s)]
*  So like I get to but it's such a weird juxtaposition to go from you go out let's say fly to you [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=2694.08s)]
*  know Phoenix or wherever and you play two nights in the same stadium dude and the next [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=2701.36s)]
*  day you're home dude and you're just dad and there's nobody there. [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=2707.16s)]
*  I mean we live in a two bedroom two bathroom house that's 2100 square foot. [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=2710.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=2714.76s)]
*  And the kids are what general admission. [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=2715.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=2716.76s)]
*  They're G.A. they don't. [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=2717.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=2718.76s)]
*  Well there's no they should get them free kids eat free. [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=2719.76s)]
*  So they just come in and just take the place over. [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=2721.1600000000003s)]
*  Dude that would be the best tour you could have if you had a kid to eat free tour. [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=2724.0s)]
*  But dude sponsored by Ryan's Buffet or Golden Crowe either one. [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=2728.92s)]
*  Oh yeah that would be the best and they should have a contest too. [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=2733.32s)]
*  What's the farthest somebody can hum a McNugget and another kid can't. [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=2736.4s)]
*  Like a like a beer Olympics but it's Buffet Olympics. [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=2743.8s)]
*  Just a McNugget. [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=2746.7000000000003s)]
*  There's something so American about seeing a McNugget go through the air. [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=2748.06s)]
*  McNugget cannon. [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=2751.06s)]
*  If you could jam like a hundred in a t-shirt cannon and just blast McNuggets out into [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=2752.06s)]
*  the crowd. [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=2758.2999999999997s)]
*  Oh lord. [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=2759.2999999999997s)]
*  Everybody's just catching them on their. [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=2760.2999999999997s)]
*  It'd be some good slow mo shots. [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=2763.2999999999997s)]
*  It's like that kiss cam with a McNugget. [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=2765.14s)]
*  But dude that's how it's going to get I think if people if it gets so bad where people can't [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=2769.3399999999997s)]
*  afford to eat or whatever then they're going to be like. [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=2772.98s)]
*  Two concerts will be events. [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=2776.1s)]
*  Food will be how to get people to events. [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=2778.7s)]
*  Got it. [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=2780.46s)]
*  100 percent man. [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=2781.46s)]
*  That's the thing you're going to need. [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=2782.46s)]
*  Pay for the show stay for the food. [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=2785.02s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=2786.74s)]
*  You know what I mean. [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=2787.74s)]
*  Can you even imagine what a huge buffet would be like at a freaking. [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=2790.74s)]
*  In a stadium. [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=2794.74s)]

*  What did we do dude we got a. [[00:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=3436.58s)]
*  Well my first car was eighty four Ford Escort. [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=3438.8199999999997s)]
*  And somebody had. [[00:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=3442.46s)]
*  Oh it was beautiful. [[00:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=3444.46s)]

*  And yeah. [[00:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=3447.46s)]
*  Some and somebody had stole the passenger seat out of it right. [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=3448.2599999999998s)]
*  See like this happened while you owned it or when you got it it had already been. [[00:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=3451.58s)]
*  Thieved. [[00:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=3455.3799999999997s)]
*  When I got the vehicle I had it for like three days and somebody stole it. [[00:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=3456.8999999999996s)]
*  I think it was the guy I think he didn't want to sell the whole car. [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=3460.22s)]
*  So he fenced it he fenced the seat. [[00:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=3462.8599999999997s)]
*  Yeah he came in it was like you know what. [[00:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=3465.5s)]
*  I'm taking this back. [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=3468.14s)]
*  I didn't mean to sell you the whole car. [[00:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=3469.7s)]
*  I wanted that seat out of there dude. [[00:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=3471.7s)]
*  Yeah I forgot. [[00:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=3473.7799999999997s)]
*  Hey I forgot my wife told me. [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=3474.7s)]
*  Yeah hey we had our first kid on that seat and she told me not. [[00:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=3476.54s)]
*  But that was a memento. [[00:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=3481.2999999999997s)]
*  It was a. [[00:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=3482.8999999999996s)]
*  It was an eighty four Ford Escort baby and I got. [[00:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=3485.62s)]
*  God I paid six hundred large for that. [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=3488.02s)]
*  What color was it. [[00:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=3490.22s)]
*  Which one like what's the most accurate representation. [[00:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=3492.06s)]
*  Gray they only had I think of the eighty four hard top. [[00:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=3494.74s)]
*  Hard top dude. [[00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=3500.54s)]
*  Do you love how this too clean. [[00:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=3502.8999999999996s)]
*  Nineteen eighty four Ford Escort dude. [[00:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=3505.06s)]
*  I'm saying hard top like there was any other. [[00:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=3507.94s)]
*  Like a drop top. [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=3512.62s)]
*  Dude you got some coin now go buy an eighty four escort and chop the top off of it. [[00:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=3514.7s)]
*  Get a convertible top one. [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=3518.66s)]
*  No I think it's supposed to have the top on it so you can get safely to school. [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=3520.54s)]
*  That's what I did in it but somebody stole my passenger seat I had for three days. [[00:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=3525.54s)]
*  So then the crazy part was you go pick a girl up and they get in the car in the back. [[00:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=3530.18s)]
*  But they had to get in the back through the front like it only had. [[00:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=3533.7400000000002s)]
*  The front door. [[00:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=3537.02s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=3537.82s)]
*  So then just well at least you didn't have to flip the seat up. [[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=3538.26s)]
*  Yeah so that part was actually nice but then if somebody wanted to be right by that if this gets right on their knees. [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=3541.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=3547.1s)]
*  So they could just but that's like built in like lounger though kind of. [[00:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=3547.5s)]
*  That's true they want to sit in the back and chill for the girls like a king vibe. [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=3550.7s)]
*  For girls that girls didn't like it. [[00:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=3554.5s)]
*  Yeah I could see that. [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=3556.62s)]
*  Yeah girls like I don't know what's happening. [[00:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=3557.94s)]
*  They were like man this car is like really trashy and you're like no it's cool. [[00:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=3559.22s)]
*  I love it. [[00:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=3563.98s)]
*  I love this car. [[00:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=3564.66s)]
*  Dude and I and then one time it got t-boned outside of. [[00:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=3565.94s)]
*  Outside of it this I think I think place called is a doors or some symbols sandwich shop Iggy's or some smorgasbord. [[00:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=3571.78s)]
*  Yes smorgasbord. [[00:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=3580.06s)]
*  Yes smorgasbord fucking bird snacks baby. [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=3583.1s)]
*  But yeah so and I got t-boned and then after that I was dating this cute girl but every time I go to her house I would try to hide the car at an angle it was so banged up now. [[00:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=3586.62s)]
*  Where like almost the angle she walked and get in she would really be able to see all the damage. [[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=3596.86s)]
*  My neon used to when I would stop the radiator would leak a little bit. [[01:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=3602.34s)]
*  So like if I wasn't driving like the radiator like there was a lit it was like that. [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=3607.6600000000003s)]
*  Like kind of that rubberized like top or the on the radiator tube there and it had just the littlest crack in there. [[01:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=3611.7400000000002s)]
*  And me and my dad we tried to fix it a million times but it would get so hot. [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=3618.54s)]
*  Like no matter what you put over it wouldn't stick like all the best like lock type bond and stuff like the heat would get it. [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=3622.86s)]
*  So it would like spit stuff out of it and then that would get on like the engine block. [[01:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=3630.78s)]
*  And so anytime I would stop it would just smoke just a little bit dude. [[01:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=3636.86s)]

*  Like I want them to only thing they're worried about is like riding bikes and playing trucks and you know riding around on the players with mom and dad. [[01:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=4104.94s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=4113.139999999999s)]
*  I don't but there gets to a point like you know as soon as like school is looming like you know I've got some other artists buddies that have kids and they're like well you got to tell them or somebody else is going to tell them. [[01:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=4113.86s)]
*  It's almost like telling your kids there's no Santa or something like it's like the opposite of that it's like the opposite of that like telling your kids there is a Luke Holmes. [[01:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=4124.3s)]
*  Right. Yeah. And it's like you I don't want them to like ever I don't want my kids to ever think of me that way like sure I want them to be. [[01:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=4132.94s)]
*  Like that was good some of his early stuff I like better. [[01:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=4140.54s)]

*  He put a magic that happened to a kid where their dad's their sales weren't as good after they had children. [[01:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=4149.46s)]
*  And they were like we have the me and my buddies have the golf theory did. [[01:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=4156.54s)]
*  Once you start playing golf sick it's bad. [[01:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=4162.18s)]
*  No no well for sure I think for me at least but it's once like the great golfers once they have kids it gets harder to maintain like because they're not like practice and stuff that they have to do. [[01:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=4163.780000000001s)]
*  I mean I don't I know next to nothing about being a professional golfer by the way. [[01:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=4178.42s)]
*  This is just a guy who watches golf and like wishes that he could do. [[01:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=4182.3s)]

*  You're like sorry man I got to I got to go do something I got to go vote. [[01:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=4192.22s)]

*  Did you did you have if you played the Super Bowl yet. [[01:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=4218.62s)]

*  Long time. [[01:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=4227.82s)]
*  Who was the last one. [[01:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=4228.58s)]
*  It was a it was a big medley of people I believe it's Clint Black Travis Trich and I. [[01:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=4229.98s)]
*  Tanya Tucker. [[01:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=4237.259999999999s)]
*  Wow. [[01:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=4238.5s)]
*  It was like a bunch of country artists that did like a big medley thing I believe. [[01:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=4239.54s)]
*  Now there's been a bunch of artists that have done the anthem. [[01:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=4243.9s)]
*  Right. [[01:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=4246.78s)]
*  But as for the halftime show there hasn't been one since you have to look it up in the mid 90s. [[01:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=4247.22s)]
*  Reba Reba McIntyre coming up the anthem though. [[01:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=4253.740000000001s)]
*  Oh the anthem anthem you mean like the actual halftime show. [[01:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=4257.26s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=4259.820000000001s)]
*  It's been it only happened one time. [[01:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=4260.42s)]
*  Only one time ever. [[01:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=4263.38s)]
*  Yep. [[01:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=4264.58s)]
*  Wow. [[01:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=4266.22s)]
*  That seems unreal huh. [[01:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=4268.3s)]
*  So it's Shania Twain Gwen Stefani and Sting. [[01:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=4269.740000000001s)]
*  OK so Shania was different than the other medley thing. [[01:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=4274.06s)]
*  Right. [[01:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=4278.7s)]
*  So they had Shania. [[01:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=4279.58s)]
*  Twice. [[01:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=4280.9400000000005s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=4281.42s)]
*  So twice ever. [[01:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=4281.9s)]
*  I would imagine that at some point Taylor Swift has to do it. [[01:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=4282.9800000000005s)]
*  Oh it's a good point. [[01:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=4287.3s)]
*  But I don't know if that would still be considered a country artist now. [[01:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=4288.38s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=4293.62s)]
*  It's kind of universal. [[01:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=4294.3s)]
*  I'd like to think like a guy like Garth's never done it. [[01:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=4295.06s)]
*  I know. [[01:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=4298.06s)]
*  A guy like George Strait's never done it. [[01:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=4298.46s)]
*  You know like so many of these guys. [[01:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=4300.9s)]
*  Oh yeah I've watched Garth sing it. [[01:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=4302.66s)]
*  You know. [[01:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=4304.62s)]
*  Have you gotten to spend much time with Garth ever. [[01:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=4305.26s)]
*  I have not a ton of time but we've we've spoken many times like I took my band out to see his his show out in Vegas. [[01:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=4307.22s)]
*  I was out there I was playing like a private event and it didn't start to like eleven thirty or something like super late night. [[01:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=4318.66s)]
*  It's like a birthday party thing. [[01:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=4324.62s)]
*  And so you know we got to Vegas like. [[01:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=4327.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=4329.42s)]
*  So I'm like what what the hell do we do all day. [[01:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=4330.46s)]
*  So start looking stuff up and like oh my gosh Garth's playing and tonight is doing his show. [[01:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=4333.26s)]
*  Got to see it. [[01:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=4337.54s)]
*  So I'm like and the band like I told the band I was like I hit my manager up I was like hit up Garth's folks and see if we can maybe get some tickets and you know. [[01:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=4338.22s)]
*  So man yeah he came in. [[01:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=4348.34s)]
*  We got over there and did he came in and said hey to the band and like the band had no idea we were going to meet him at all because like some dude my band guys are like a couple of them from Oklahoma. [[01:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=4349.98s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=4359.94s)]
*  So I love him they probably love him. [[01:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=4360.46s)]
*  Drawings of him and so 100 percent they do. [[01:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=4362.54s)]
*  And but he came in and taught everybody got us great seats they let us come in like because you know those shows they're like no phones or whatever I think like a lot of the Vegas stuff you can have your phone or something. [[01:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=4365.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=4375.46s)]
*  So because they don't want to yeah I think they don't want anybody having their phone. [[01:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=4376.74s)]
*  To like see so they can't like record records. [[01:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=4379.86s)]
*  People sell it like stream right. [[01:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=4382.7s)]
*  Vietnam. [[01:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=4384.94s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=4386.18s)]
*  All kind of stuff. [[01:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=4386.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=4387.54s)]
*  So they let us come in like right when the lights went down they brought us in because like I was like hey man I want to come but there's no like those theaters there's not really like suites or like backstage. [[01:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=4388.22s)]
*  Right. [[01:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=4398.98s)]
*  You don't want to take away from his his attention. [[01:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=4399.22s)]
*  I'm like hey man I just want to like come in like just sit this thing and like not you know. [[01:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=4401.0199999999995s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=4406.0599999999995s)]
*  It's weird like I tell people like man I don't really like being the center of attention as weird as that is considering what I do. [[01:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=4406.54s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=4412.66s)]
*  It makes me like really uncomfortable like when people make like a big deal about me like being that stuff. [[01:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=4412.9800000000005s)]
*  Oh maybe yeah. [[01:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=4418.54s)]
*  And I'm just like oh gosh man like I don't I don't really try not to think about myself. [[01:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=4419.5s)]
*  Yeah well it's interesting yeah because if you start thinking about yourself that way I think it's almost better to try and purposely not think of yourself. [[01:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=4424.86s)]
*  Yeah for sure. [[01:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=4431.3s)]

*  You know I got this sire truck and that was being kind of a nightmare because it's fun to drive. [[01:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=4436.26s)]
*  But it's just too much attention you know. [[01:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=4440.700000000001s)]
*  I saw it. [[01:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=4442.9800000000005s)]
*  And then I'll be hiding in it and I'm just. [[01:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=4443.820000000001s)]

*  It's pixelated. [[01:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=4455.22s)]
*  Yeah it feels like you just travel like you're literally it feels like you'll put like you'll press the gas and you'll wake up in damn August dude. [[01:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=4456.54s)]

*  Yeah. [[01:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=4711.860000000001s)]
*  That's half the fun is like trying to get there and trying to figure out how to get there and doing everything it takes to get there is like a lot of the enjoyment of the process. [[01:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=4712.580000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=4721.1s)]

*  You're like dang. [[01:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=4728.38s)]
*  And I wish I would have bottled that up somehow. [[01:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=4729.74s)]
*  That's better. [[01:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=4732.1s)]
*  Or done that. [[01:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=4732.54s)]
*  Do you think though like do you look at because you've gotten to have a great trajectory just a great career you just you know you've worked hard and you've also been fortunate right. [[01:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=4734.1s)]
*  Yes very much so. [[01:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=4742.74s)]
*  How do does it get to be like well what else is there to shoot for kind of like does that kind of become a and not like in a net like a just curious. [[01:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=4744.42s)]
*  Like how do you find a motivation if you're do you feel like it could be a trap like oh I don't want to lose motivation here because things have gone so well. [[01:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=4755.26s)]
*  Yeah for sure man because you you know you kind of get to this place where you're like man I feel like I've done you know a lot of the stuff that I feel like I can do almost like as far as achievements go or whatever it may be. [[01:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=4763.1s)]
*  And yeah you think you know you have to do as much work or more work than you've ever done to stay in that place. [[01:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=4776.22s)]
*  I swear before if you're doing that amount of work you're constantly moving towards a goal. [[01:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=4785.06s)]
*  Right. [[01:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=4789.06s)]
*  Right. It's like if you work all this time to climb Mount Everest and it's say it's so hard you know to you've got to cross the crevasses and do all these different things to make it to the top. [[01:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=4789.620000000001s)]
*  Well it's like once you get there you need oxygen just to even breathe while you're up there. [[01:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=4802.860000000001s)]
*  And so it may take a higher toll on your body to stay at the top than it does to come back down or than it did to even get up there. [[01:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=4808.06s)]
*  And so it feels like it can have there's somewhat of like a hamster wheel feel to it like when you get to the certain level because you're like man I'm working so hard just to like. [[01:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=4815.9800000000005s)]
*  Right. [[01:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=4828.3s)]
*  Compete against the other guys that are up here too and all the other people that are coming up to the top as well. [[01:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=4828.62s)]
*  You're like you're doing all this work to stay. [[01:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=4838.18s)]
*  Well do I want to do I have to continually try to do you know compete with this guy and this guy and there's other people going we're coming to and we're ready to just this is part of your ass off the top of this thing if we get the chance. [[01:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=4840.34s)]
*  God. [[01:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=4853.74s)]
*  So there's. [[01:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=4854.66s)]
*  Scared. [[01:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=4855.46s)]
*  It's like there's there's always that next but that's again dude it comes back to to growing up with your fan base and just growing yourself is learning that nobody says at the top forever. [[01:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=4856.1s)]
*  And it's OK to not be at the top. [[01:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=4867.9400000000005s)]

*  So is it whenever you start a new album? Do you then have to go tour it after is that kind of how it goes? [[01:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=5766.08s)]
*  Or is it I think traditionally that's how a lot of folks do it this album [[01:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=5770.599999999999s)]
*  It feels like a lot of ways nontraditional in the sense of like it started out as just kind of this like [[01:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=5775.48s)]
*  you know [[01:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=5783.12s)]
*  wild idea of like I had written a couple of these dad songs that I really liked and [[01:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=5784.64s)]
*  I was like man. I feel like you know, these three of these songs are really great. I love them [[01:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=5789.5599999999995s)]
*  but I was like but I have to like choose one if I'm gonna do a record because like [[01:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=5794.4s)]
*  Can't put a record out and then it's like oh, there's like three or four dad sounds like we get it [[01:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=5798.5199999999995s)]
*  Right my god, and I was like, well would it make sense to like to do something that I don't want to say side project [[01:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=5803.24s)]
*  that's not the right term because it is me it is my stuff but like I [[01:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=5809.76s)]
*  Hate the word concept album because like it feels like that's too smart for something that I'm capable of doing right like someone that makes [[01:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=5813.6s)]
*  Yeah, concept album to me is like Martians or whatever super like genius level musician and I'm not that at all [[01:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=5820.2s)]
*  but it's like [[01:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=5827.08s)]
*  it's like [[01:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=5828.5199999999995s)]
*  Cornbread concept album. Okay, I mean like [[01:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=5830.0s)]
*  But it's just I was like well if I made a whole record of just these songs [[01:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=5833.4s)]
*  You know and then I got like like a lot of my buddies were all the same age [[01:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=5837.36s)]
*  So they're having kids so, you know, they're you know, they've got aging parents too [[01:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=5840.52s)]
*  And so all these themes are running through all of our lives [[01:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=5845.08s)]
*  Yeah, so they would start sending me little clips because you know, they knew I had kids or whatever [[01:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=5847.44s)]
*  And so they'd send me a star to something and I go god man. I really love that [[01:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=5852.1s)]
*  I'd love to like get together work on that or whatever and next thing [[01:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=5856.08s)]
*  You know, I end up with you know a whole record full of these songs and I was like [[01:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=5859.46s)]
*  We should just record these and like just do a project. That's just [[01:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=5863.18s)]
*  You know, so it's like [[01:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=5867.06s)]
*  It's my next record I guess but it also doesn't feel like my next record if that makes sense [[01:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=5868.94s)]
*  Like it's not like if you want to listen to all my other records. It's not [[01:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=5874.62s)]
*  Logically the next step from like where you would think that it would go [[01:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=5881.3s)]
*  It's just kind of like where my life has taken me like sonically it's very like I said we recorded it live [[01:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=5884.46s)]
*  So it's very like it's very traditional country sounding [[01:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=5890.1s)]
*  Stuff cuz all just live instrumentation. Yeah, there's a lot of fiddle. There's a lot of sounds really dobro [[01:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=5894.58s)]
*  Like it's it's very natural sounding [[01:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=5899.9400000000005s)]
*  And so, you know sounds groovy. I mean I'm willing to small maybe six or seven songs or something [[01:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=5902.58s)]
*  But it's definitely got its own vibe to it always leaving. What's that one? Oh [[01:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=5907.7s)]
*  Yeah, all I ever do is leave yeah [[01:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=5913.06s)]
*  God that songs that's as long as brutal do not haad moan eyes in my ass [[01:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=5917.46s)]

*  Sometimes I think it's easier for people to leave than stay man. Mm-hmm [[01:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=5928.5s)]
*  some people they just [[01:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=5932.900000000001s)]
*  They know they can't change themselves, right? And so they'd rather leave somebody [[01:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=5934.900000000001s)]
*  Yeah and eliminate themselves from the situation [[01:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=5939.38s)]
*  Dude, that's crazy. Yeah, that's for sure man happens all the time, dude [[01:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=5942.860000000001s)]

*  All of a sudden we started seeing buggies coming from all directions and we saw them all pulling into a lane there [[01:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=6717.44s)]
*  They sure looked handsome a lot of men in their Sunday best. They sure looked handsome [[01:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=6722.139999999999s)]
*  What an interesting blog here dude, they are a state of Amish youth culture Sunday evening singing [[01:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=6729.32s)]
*  This is often where teenagers meet their future mates make friends and just have some good clean fun [[01:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=6734.52s)]
*  Food is served pizza mates is like gross. Yeah sounds very like primal, you know [[01:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=6739.8s)]
*  Yeah future mates say like spouse or like but I remember doing when I was growing we grew up in a pretty small town [[01:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=6746.72s)]
*  So it was like you knew you were probably gonna have to marry somebody in town somebody in there [[01:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=6753.200000000001s)]
*  And they would even tell us that in school. I remember when we're like second grade [[01:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=6758.76s)]
*  You're probably gonna marry somebody yeah, they'd like look around the classroom. There's one other classroom as kids in it [[01:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=6762.12s)]
*  You can look at some of them, but you guys are kind of the talent. This is [[01:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=6767.16s)]
*  Yeah, kind of everything we got going you like this is bad [[01:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=6771.96s)]
*  This is pretty limited [[01:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=6780.04s)]
*  Do you manage your tours differently as time goes on where you're like, okay [[01:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=6784.320000000001s)]
*  I want to do just certain cities and just or do you choose that or how do you guys put that together? [[01:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=6787.92s)]
*  Yeah, I think you know, we've had we've always had a long strategy on how do we you know, how do we maximize? [[01:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=6792.68s)]
*  This or that, you know, we have certain goals, you know playing overseas was always big goal for us like [[01:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=6798.64s)]
*  consists playing overseas consistently to the point where we feel like [[01:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=6804.68s)]
*  We had really fostered a fan base [[01:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=6808.6s)]
*  that [[01:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=6811.68s)]
*  Could almost be self-sustaining in the sense of like, you know, you could go tour one year [[01:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=6812.8s)]
*  You could just go tour in Europe and then never plenty shows in the States [[01:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=6817.88s)]
*  You know like so as to not burn every market, right? Right if you go see me, you know if I play every [[01:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=6821.56s)]
*  summer in [[01:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=6830.08s)]
*  You know Tallahassee. Well, it's like if that happens five or six years in a row like eventually people [[01:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=6831.400000000001s)]
*  Everybody in that markets gonna be a while. I've seen that dude. Yeah, so the idea is if I play I [[01:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=6836.88s)]
*  Don't know why I picked Tallahassee such a [[01:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=6842.08s)]
*  Even though we never even played there before but I've been there [[01:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=6844.68s)]
*  I don't if like if you pick that city and we played there. Let's say I played there in [[01:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=6847.72s)]
*  2018 right and then let's say obviously that's a weird year because Cove it happens or whatever, but it's okay [[01:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=6852.92s)]
*  It's still a year. Yeah, let's say I play there in 2021 and then the next time I'm gonna play there is not till 2024 [[01:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=6860.26s)]
*  So in those three years so much will have happened in my career [[01:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=6867.64s)]
*  maybe I could have maybe two new albums a bunch more hit songs and [[01:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=6872.04s)]
*  Those people in that market. They'll have only had the opportunity to see me the time before right? [[01:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=6877.08s)]
*  They'll go well now I want to hear this song and this song in this song and like he never comes down here [[01:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=6883.08s)]
*  So I want to go like yeah [[01:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=6888.0s)]
*  I like I just want to be able to tour [[01:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=6889.2s)]
*  At a high level for a long time and I think to do that you have to have a really long play strategy [[01:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=6892.12s)]
*  It can't be about well [[01:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=6897.76s)]
*  How can I make the most money this show this weekend and charge my fans the most for tickets and do the most and sell? [[01:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=6899.6s)]
*  VIP things like I've never sold a meet-and-greet in my life [[01:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=6905.68s)]
*  Yeah, like that's a big point of revenue for a lot of artists is and nothing against anybody that does that by the way [[01:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=6908.360000000001s)]
*  I just always felt weird about it [[01:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=6915.200000000001s)]
*  The first meet-and-greets I ever did were $50 and we donated all the money to a camp in Georgia for children that have cancer [[01:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=6917.12s)]
*  oh, yeah ever since then we've never even charged for a meet-and-greet all you have to do is join the fan club and [[01:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=6923.44s)]
*  Have tickets to the show and you're entered into a lottery to win. Oh damn. That's a good way to do it [[01:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=6929.64s)]
*  Yeah, like so you join the fan club and then you just put in for whatever show you're going to and it's completely free [[01:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=6934.36s)]
*  Oh, that's cool. I come in the room like do a Q&A thing take pictures with everybody [[01:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=6940.599999999999s)]
*  Like and I just feel like there's so much to already like pay for yeah, there's so like there's t-shirts [[01:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=6946.4800000000005s)]
*  There's beer. There's food. There's parking. There's hotels. There's babysitters. There's tickets. There's [[01:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=6953.62s)]
*  Everything do you're charged at every turn? [[01:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=6959.12s)]
*  Yeah, and the whole experience and like I just want to meet people who came to the show man [[01:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=6961.2s)]
*  like whether it's their first show or their 15th show or whatever it is man like [[01:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=6966.7s)]
*  It's just a way for me to like I just want to say thank you to just regular folks who come to my show man [[01:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=6971.58s)]
*  Like because they are the only reason that we have shows. Yeah, like oh, it's crazy to think that you can't figure out a way [[01:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=6976.740000000001s)]
*  Just thank them all the time. It feels like you can never thank them enough dude [[01:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=6982.700000000001s)]
*  And like it really is like I think about all the times like, you know [[01:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=6986.06s)]
*  Sometimes I feel like the fan is the last person thought about in the music business [[01:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=6990.700000000001s)]
*  Wow, like and that to me is really sad. Well, they just started a [[01:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=6994.3s)]
*  They're finally bringing sanctions against Live Nation, I think you look that up I saw something about this recently [[01:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=6999.18s)]
*  They're finally bringing sanctions against him or ticket Matt one of them for yeah [[01:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=7005.54s)]
*  I saw something on the news like two three years ago, but I don't know enough about it [[01:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=7009.82s)]
*  But there's definitely you're definitely right here. I definitely just saw something about that. Yeah, the Justice Department is suing taking master and Live Nation [[01:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=7013.06s)]
*  What does that mean for concert goers? [[01:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=7019.68s)]
*  Is it for like the fees or something? [[01:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=7022.66s)]
*  I think the Justice Department on Thursday accused Live Nation of engaging in a slew of practices that have allowed it to maintain a stronghold over [[01:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=7025.700000000001s)]
*  The live music scene they accused of using long-term contracts to keep venues from choosing rival ticketers [[01:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=7031.740000000001s)]
*  Blocking venues from using multiple ticket sellers and threatening venues that they could lose money and fans if they didn't choose ticket master [[01:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=7037.22s)]
*  Which in then they can they can jack up the prices of tickets in so they own 70% of ticketing [[01:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=7045.900000000001s)]
*  That's unbelievable, that's a lot dude, how do you ever let that happen? It just seems like they wouldn't let that happen [[01:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=7053.0199999999995s)]
*  Did you ever go see widespread panic [[01:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=7061.099999999999s)]
*  Never did man might so my best friend heart the guy that jumped off then that's his like favorite band ever [[01:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5VM3aakJfY&t=7063.82s)]
