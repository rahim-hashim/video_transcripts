*  I'm sharp. Yeah, look at me. I'm in fucking monochrome. Is that what that print is? [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=105.36s)]

*  life. Oh, definitely. I mean, I've been involved in some like, it's not right. It's like the most [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=152.48000000000002s)]
*  racial of screens if it's monochrome, right? It's black and white kind of. It's the apartheid of [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=157.28000000000003s)]
*  print. Yeah. I scream it when I come monochrome because clerks was in black and white. Yeah. So [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=163.76s)]
*  everything ties back to clerks. Oh, only clerks. The only way I could come now is thinking of clerks. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=171.04s)]
*  Well, I love the mall rat shoes, man. Those are so that's I mean, that's really cool. Did we start? [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=177.76s)]

*  use bullshitting and all of a sudden, you're five minutes into a conversation. I'm like, oh, [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=201.6s)]
*  I bet you we started and shit. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Sometimes it's like, I think sometimes some [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=205.84s)]
*  places things are a little more formal. I don't know. Sometimes I feel like if you start, [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=210.95999999999998s)]
*  if I say start, then it doesn't go as I don't know. I mean, you're a director. What is that? [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=216.48s)]
*  Like if you say, well, it depends on you. I like to think of a director, but you go on the internet. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=221.36s)]

*  wait a second. Yeah, it's far. What? Why are we here? Like I thought you were a Nashville person. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=280.24s)]

*  we tape here. So you live in, do you live in Nashville? I live in Tennessee. Yeah, full time. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=290.0s)]
*  Where in Tennessee? I live just like right outside of the city. I live kind of by like Lipscomb high [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=294.88s)]

*  quite a bit. Like I was just in Kingsport because we did the Smokey Mountain Fan Fest and then like [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=303.84s)]
*  a month before that I was in Knoxville. Like anytime I go out and do shows, that's generally [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=307.84s)]
*  a place that I've always wound up. I was in, can I tell you a fucking story real quick? So I was in, [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=314.56s)]
*  recently I was in Kentucky. I went and did a show in Lexington. Lexington is awesome. Beautiful, [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=319.2s)]
*  right? So I'm, I, you know, when I'm, I'm vegan, I hate saying that because everyone's like, fuck [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=324.88s)]
*  you. Now I'm eating twice as much meat. I'm like, all right, that's on you. Yeah. People don't get [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=332.24s)]
*  tight, but I want vegan cause I almost being stomach gay or whatever. Hey, they, I, I, I, I had a heart [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=336.32s)]
*  attack six and a half years ago. So I wound up going vegan and it helped. Used to be happy. Now [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=343.44s)]
*  I'm fucking vegan. So it's just part of, you know, it's just what I do, but I don't try to push it on [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=347.52s)]
*  people and shit like that. Like when I started smoking weed back in the day, I was definitely [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=352.56s)]
*  like proselytizing for that. Like, oh my God, you should try this. Veganism I don't proselytize for [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=357.12s)]
*  because people get really triggered by the word. Now, if somebody's like, Hey man, how'd you lose [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=362.72s)]
*  that fucking way? Or, you know, some people have been like, you fucking Uzupic bitch. I'm like, no, [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=367.28000000000003s)]
*  fuck. I, I, I went vegan after my heart attack. That's how to weight went away. Not because like, [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=371.04s)]
*  you know, I necessarily tried, although I do now fucking walk over 10,000 steps a day, [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=376.96000000000004s)]
*  but you know, I was like, I, I don't want to die. So let me try this. And I thought I'd do it for a [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=382.08s)]
*  few months and then go back. And then I never went back. Being vegan. You mean? Yeah. Yeah. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=388.15999999999997s)]
*  Can you still have house plants if you're a vegan or is that like a weird? Absolutely. Number one, [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=392.79999999999995s)]
*  I, I, I'm sure I am on some left level, an ethical vegan who should think about that. Like I do love [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=397.59999999999997s)]
*  animals. So I'm sure that's some part of why it's easy for me to be vegan, but I was not one of those [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=405.35999999999996s)]
*  like I'm doing it because it's the right thing to do. I did it to save my fucking life and it [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=410.88s)]
*  worked out and shit. So even if I like, you know, it was like, fuck a house plant, but I'd, [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=415.44s)]
*  I'd still go vegan. Where are we going with that house plant thing? No. Oh, I just didn't know if [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=420.56s)]
*  you were like a plant, if you only eat, cause vegan means you can only eat plants. The idea that, [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=425.04s)]
*  well, I'm plant based. Okay. So it's the idea that if I can't have a plant base, cause I'm like, [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=429.44s)]
*  well, this is my friend, but I'm going to eat them. Well, it would just seem like. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=433.44s)]
*  Like having a fish tank and eating and being a person that he can be in a pescatarian. Yeah. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=437.6s)]
*  Yeah. I guess I was like, at some point they're going to catch on that. You know what I'm saying? [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=444.0s)]
*  They're going to be like, this guy's playing both sides of the net and the plants are going to [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=446.8s)]
*  start leaning for out and shit. Get defensive. That's where the Venus flytrap came from. A plant [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=449.52000000000004s)]
*  that was like, I must defend myself against a vegan. That was one of the first craziest movies [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=455.36s)]
*  that I ever heard when I was a kid. The little shop of whores. Yeah. Little shop of whores. It [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=459.44000000000005s)]
*  was like a weird musical about like a Venus flytrap. Yeah. Yeah. The Audrey two and had a [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=464.48s)]
*  plant that came from outer space though. Oh, that you didn't lose a lot of sleep over it. Did you? [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=470.56s)]
*  No, I didn't. I wasn't, I don't think it scared me. It was just interesting. It was like a little [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=475.44s)]
*  bit before my time. Like right. Like we didn't, I don't know if I've ever seen it, but I just [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=480.16s)]
*  remember off Broadway. Cause I grew up like on the East coast. So you saw the musical. Yeah. Like on [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=485.68s)]
*  stage and shit before it became this musical, which was awesome. Oh, before it became a movie. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=490.08000000000004s)]
*  Wow. So it was a big musical first. It was off Broadway hit. Um, you look at that. It was a big [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=494.8s)]
*  ass puppet, like on stage. Yeah. There's a picture of it right there. I guess. Well, yeah, kind of [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=500.88000000000005s)]
*  there's on stage, the ones to the, to the right. And that one picture that looks like the stage [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=506.48s)]
*  show. Oh, I forgot. Like again, modern podcast, you guys like have a screen and you spend an [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=511.44000000000005s)]
*  ordinary amount of time looking at images and videos and shit. That was something that never [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=517.6s)]
*  occurred to us in 2007. You just had to use your imagination. We just talked to each other. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=521.68s)]
*  And there was also no real video component. Like that was the attraction of doing the podcast. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=525.5999999999999s)]
*  It's like, I can just fucking do it. Dress like however I am. It's like voicing animation or [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=529.92s)]
*  something. Yeah. But y'all have gotten it down to fucking science. Like I, you know, when I went to [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=534.4799999999999s)]

*  Dick? Are you sucking to get that much Celsius? Oh dude. And what am I doing wrong? Theo. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=561.28s)]
*  It can be, you just don't swallow the meat. Okay. You put it in your mouth. You just don't swallow. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=569.04s)]
*  Um, I, why on earth can I get this fucking podcast thing down to a science? I'm doing it. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=574.64s)]
*  But you were one of the premier, I mean, you, you were one of the early guys in it. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=580.64s)]
*  Do you know what? Here's where I thought, and I've said this on other podcasts, so we'll do [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=584.48s)]
*  other things and shit and bond word. That's awesome. Um, like I thought I was so smart because I was [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=588.64s)]
*  like, oh, we'll do all these podcasts and we give them out for free. And then when I'm in their town [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=594.48s)]
*  doing a live show, that's when they'll buy a ticket because they've gotten all this free. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=599.12s)]
*  And that was how I was like, and that's how we'll make money on podcasting. So that was your [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=603.68s)]
*  strategy from the beginning. You're saying that was my generation. I mean, it wasn't even my [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=608.72s)]
*  strategy. It was just like, we really had just started cause I was like, this is fucking fun. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=612.08s)]
*  And we're me and Moser sitting around like goofing off and having a microphone on fun conversations [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=616.0s)]
*  appealed to me. We always take snapshots of people and whatnot. There are pictures to [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=621.28s)]
*  memorialize a moment, capture moment, but nobody ever really records a conversation and shit, [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=625.12s)]
*  a normal conversation. If you're on TV, sure. So that's why I loved podcasting the idea of [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=630.16s)]
*  doing that shit. And then one day we had a lot of people listening to podcasts and they were like, [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=634.56s)]
*  my business manager is like, uh, you got a bill for a thing called the server. And it was like [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=640.56s)]
*  really high. And I was like, what the fuck is this? And it turns out podcasting is free for [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=644.9599999999999s)]
*  everybody, but the fucking podcast, or particularly if people watch the podcast and shit. So we were [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=649.1999999999999s)]
*  hosting on our own server. So we had to figure out like, all right, what the fuck? How do we pay for [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=654.64s)]
*  this? And I was like, well, we could do it live. We could start doing live shows. But even before [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=658.64s)]
*  that, like, I remember like we were, it was, it was so primitive when we were reverse engineering [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=664.7199999999999s)]
*  going like, what did they do in the early days of TV? Like on 21, that game show, they had Geritol [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=669.6s)]
*  like as a sponsor, maybe we should get an advertiser. Like we've been watching TV our whole [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=676.3199999999999s)]
*  lives. But when we were doing the podcast, like it was, it was less going like perhaps someone [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=681.12s)]
*  will pay us to say things about their product. Like they did in the fifties. So the hard way [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=686.24s)]
*  of learning. It really was rudimentary. It got harder because the sponsor we reached out to, [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=691.6s)]
*  the first sponsor we had was fleshlight. Like, cause they had written me a letter after Zach [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=695.52s)]
*  and Mary Megaporno. Cause we had a whole fleshlight scene and they were like, uh, hey man, [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=699.84s)]
*  if you ever want to do a fleshlight, like fucking let us know. And I've still, one day I will do the [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=704.08s)]
*  Kevin Smith's mouth. Like fuck him in the mouth. My own fleshlight. Yeah. That, you know, a fan. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=709.68s)]
*  Well then people leaving angry comments can actually take it. You know what I'm saying? [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=715.12s)]
*  A fan and an enemy, somebody who hates your shit, fan and a hater could both enjoy that. Like fuck [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=718.64s)]
*  Kevin Smith or Kevin Smith. So they had written this really lovely letter and filed it away. Like, [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=723.12s)]
*  oh, that's cute. And then, fleshlight. And then when we needed to pay the server bill and shit, [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=729.3599999999999s)]
*  I said to Scott Mojure, I was like, man, what if we reached out to fleshlight? Like they, [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=736.0s)]
*  maybe they'll sponsor our few shows if we like, and so they were way into it. Like this was, [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=740.4s)]
*  this was so early in the game. We're talking like 2007, maybe on the cusp of 2000. Wow. And so, [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=747.28s)]
*  and so much so that Rogan called me like in 2010 going like, should I fucking use fleshlight? [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=753.52s)]
*  Yeah. And I was like, for your dick. And he goes, no, for the show. And I was like, oh, [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=760.8s)]
*  number one, use it for your dick. It's amazing. I said, number two, definitely use it for the show. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=764.24s)]
*  And so they started advertising on Joe's show and then they started selling way more fleshlights [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=768.4s)]
*  because they'd been with us for like two years and anybody who listened to us is like, we're [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=773.76s)]
*  fucking it already. Yeah. You know, it's its own market's got a glass ceiling. But once he went to [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=777.6800000000001s)]
*  Joe, they shattered the glass ceiling. Joe Rogan shattered the glass ceiling for fleshlight. There's [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=783.28s)]
*  your fucking headline. That's what you don't get credit for. So that's so we had to figure that [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=788.5600000000001s)]
*  shit out. And then like, I remember trying to take it out on a live show. Like I used to do [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=793.44s)]
*  Q and A's just me by myself, evening with Kevin Smith and shit like that. Yeah. Kind of close [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=798.32s)]
*  to comedy, but more, I guess now they call it crowd work where it's like, look, I need you to [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=802.5600000000001s)]
*  say something before I could be funny. And so I'd let the audience ask questions and then I'd go [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=807.5200000000001s)]
*  off and stuff like that. Cause I've seen you guys do live podcasts and over the years, I mean, [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=811.9200000000001s)]
*  obviously seen you do a lot of stuff, but just for the listeners, you don't know a server. It's like [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=815.9200000000001s)]
*  where you kind of host your podcast so that it can go out into the world. So we were just on the [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=819.6s)]
*  server that our files were on and the email. What is that for the office? It was the view skew.com [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=824.72s)]
*  server. So we hosted a website, right? Viewskew.com. So because of that, we already had a server up and [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=831.44s)]
*  running. So that's where we started hosting them. We didn't like now you feed them into [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=836.8000000000001s)]
*  apple podcasts. That shit necessarily didn't exist. Oh, that's true. That might not even have been [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=840.96s)]
*  there. So people had to get it. Like it was almost like a AM or like a CB radio. Like there were [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=845.52s)]
*  probably people listening on CB radio. We were fucking distributing podcasts via carrier pigeon [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=850.96s)]
*  at that point. Like we would roll up little things to their legs and set them off and people in other [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=855.84s)]
*  cities would be like, I get it. I get it. It was weird. It was going into a comedy club and going [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=860.0s)]
*  like, we want to do a podcast here. Like, cause you know, I toured so much by myself that when I [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=865.68s)]
*  asked my agent one point, I was like, Hey man, me and Mo's want to go out and do some podcasts [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=871.76s)]
*  in front of people. So can you hook it up? Like in any of the gigs I normally do, but all those [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=875.1999999999999s)]
*  places like didn't want to pay me what they normally pay me. They're like, what are you doing? [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=880.8s)]
*  And I'm like, well, I'm sitting next to my friend and we're talking to each other. And they're like, [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=885.92s)]
*  and you're not going to take questions. I was like, no, not I maybe I guess, but that's not [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=889.76s)]
*  really part of the show. They're like, I don't know. That sounds risky. And so we had to fucking do [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=894.4s)]
*  the show for like 70, 30 splits, like a very small clubs. Cause they were like, what do you mean a [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=899.36s)]
*  pod cast like that kind of shit. So after the first tour, like, and then we put the shows out, [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=905.84s)]
*  people are like, Oh shit, it's fun. And doing it with a live audience was this weird experience. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=911.44s)]
*  Cause we'd always done it in a room like this with nobody but each other entertaining each other. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=916.48s)]
*  And then suddenly do it in front of people. You know, it's a world of difference. Yeah. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=921.28s)]
*  I mean, podcast, the podcast, that was the N word of like, um, like whatever, you know, [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=924.8s)]
*  video audio communication or whatever for a while. Like you wouldn't even say it. Or if somebody said [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=933.28s)]
*  he were like, this guy's outlier or this guy's a, you know, a pervert or whatever, you know, [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=937.76s)]
*  I think this guy's a pedo. Yeah. Yeah. You're like, oh, Cass, is that what you fucking said? [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=943.92s)]
*  I remember when we did tough. Yeah. We're here to catch. Yeah. Have you seen all these videos? [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=948.7199999999999s)]
*  Every video now online is just like this guy's here to meet a 14 year old. You see those videos [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=952.24s)]
*  all the time. No, is that right? Yeah. Sorry. I mean, there's a TV show all about that. Yeah. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=957.92s)]
*  But they now it's like every, everybody's a vigilante. It's so rogue. There's an industry [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=963.4399999999999s)]
*  that does it. What's his name? Chris Hansen, which to be fair, you know, he's good at it, but, [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=970.3199999999999s)]
*  Oh, he was the Stanley of pedo busting. Chris Hansen. That's what it says. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=975.6s)]
*  Chiron and every TV appearance. Now it's Kevin. And now it's just, I mean, it's people, I mean, [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=982.0s)]
*  there's thousands of them that go up all the time. It just like constantly Tyrone came to meet a 13 [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=986.4s)]
*  year old girl. It's always at like a Walmart or something. But yeah, it's a big business now, [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=992.24s)]
*  right? Not, I shouldn't say that. It's not a big, but catching these people, baiting them online, [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=997.28s)]
*  yourself, people just to create a, you know, and then get views and stuff like that. It's a thing. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=1001.6s)]
*  It's a dark world. But I interrupted you, but yeah, that's so what I didn't even think. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=1007.36s)]
*  In Tusk, our main character was a podcaster and there were a bunch of, [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=1011.68s)]
*  Yeah, Haley and Justin Long was the guy who got turned into a Walrus. But like that when we put [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=1016.88s)]
*  the movie out there, there were some reviews that were like, he has a job I've never heard of before [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=1024.96s)]
*  and shit like that. Like now it feels like, well, I mean, like only murders in the buildings is [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=1030.16s)]
*  predicated on podcasting. Like podcasting has become absolutely massive. But yeah, I never [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=1036.96s)]
*  figured out how to make money from it. Certainly not enough to have a fucking Celsius fridge. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=1043.1200000000001s)]
*  Yeah. What is that all about? How does that happen? [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=1047.3600000000001s)]
*  Dude, they mailed it one day and the guy- [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=1050.0800000000002s)]
*  Who's they? I want details, Theo. You can't just fucking gloss over this. Like that's the [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=1052.0s)]
*  most impressive thing I've seen in a month. Lord Celsius. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=1057.1200000000001s)]
*  Is that who was? What is he like? You know what? That's bad to me. I'm assuming it's a guy. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=1060.64s)]
*  Could be a lady, but I assume you would have called her Lady Celsius. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=1065.8400000000001s)]
*  Yeah. Her majesty. Yeah. I don't know. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=1068.88s)]
*  Queen Celsius. The Empress Celsius. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=1071.2s)]
*  Yes. The Empress Celsius. That's who it is. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=1073.28s)]
*  Fuck all this fooling around. How did you get that free shit? Tell me right now. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=1075.52s)]
*  Yeah. We had a sponsorship with them and then they sent that at some point. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=1079.92s)]
*  And it's kind of like some of the guys have struggled, you know, some of the guys can't [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=1083.3600000000001s)]
*  turn their necks have had so much of it. It's fucking- [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=1087.04s)]
*  My kid introduced me to it because she's like, it's vegan. You can drink it. I was like, right on. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=1089.04s)]
*  Kids are drinking it? Yeah. Well, she's 25. I guess I don't [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=1092.48s)]
*  know if she counts as a kid anymore. But one day she came over and we were recording a podcast. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=1095.52s)]
*  We got a podcast that's dropping on iHeart. It's called Beardless Dickless Me. I got a free plug. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=1100.48s)]
*  But we were about to record and I cracked a Celsius and she was like, how many of those [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=1105.52s)]
*  you've had today? And I was like, this is the 10th. And she goes, what are you fucking nuts? [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=1109.68s)]
*  It's an energy drink. And I was like, you said it was vegan. She's like, those two things are [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=1113.44s)]
*  not mutually exclusive. You're a fucking heart attack victim. She's like, and then she went [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=1117.12s)]
*  online like the way you guys are like somebody's in another room fucking looking shit up. She [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=1121.36s)]
*  immediately went online. She was like, oh my God, you can't have more than fucking two a day. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=1125.28s)]
*  What are you nuts? Yeah, they're very strong. They're good. But they never felt that strong [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=1128.7199999999998s)]
*  to me. Like I never felt like hyped, but maybe you don't feel it. Maybe that's the thing about [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=1132.8s)]

*  sports. I don't know what that was. Were you too fat? Did they pull a scale out or how do they even do it? [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=1358.48s)]
*  The way I understand it years after the fact was because somebody was like, hey man, I work in the [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=1363.6799999999998s)]
*  industry. I think this is what happened because they never flat out told me. It was a packed [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=1369.28s)]
*  fucking flight. I wasn't even supposed to be on that flight. I was supposed to go to the next flight, [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=1374.56s)]
*  but they had rooms. I was like, oh, fuck it. I'll get on this. When I walked down the jetway, excuse [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=1378.56s)]
*  me, like the one guy was like, where are you going? And I was like, they gave me a ticket. I'm getting [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=1383.6s)]
*  on. And he's like, no, there's too many already. And I was like, well, the lady just gave me this. [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=1388.48s)]
*  And he's like, so I walked onto the plane, sat down, I was sat between like two women in like the [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=1393.84s)]
*  bulkhead of like, if you first walk in and you go to the left, that's we were on the right side of [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=1401.12s)]
*  the plane. And you know, I'm sitting there and shit and fucking buckled my seatbelt and whatnot. [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=1407.4399999999998s)]
*  And the armrests were there. And I was definitely fucking way heavier than I am now. How much do you [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=1412.32s)]
*  think you were? Three, three, I probably weighed my area code, which was three, two, three. [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=1417.28s)]
*  Yeah, I was as high as three, 30, three, 34. At one point, I think that's the biggest, [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=1423.36s)]
*  that we look like a healthy one 85 right now. It's between I live between one 85 and 200, [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=1429.6s)]
*  depending on if it's a bread week or not a bread week. And if I'm breading up, then like, [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=1436.1599999999999s)]
*  I kind of tend to blow it up. But that was again, that was the heart attack that was like after the [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=1440.72s)]
*  heart attack, I was so fucking terrified of dying and shit. And actually, I wasn't at the heart [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=1446.24s)]
*  attack. I was fucking cool about it. Like I was always scared of dying and shit. And then on the [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=1451.28s)]
*  table, like the guy had told me Dr. Layden, my guy, my core cardiologist who just fucking retired. [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=1455.28s)]
*  And he told me before he retired, I was like, when I was you're gone, what do I fucking do? Who's my [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=1461.84s)]
*  new cardiologist? And he was like, Kevin, you don't need a cardiologist anymore. It was like [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=1465.44s)]
*  the end of Wizard of Oz is like, you could have always taken care of your own heart, just put [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=1470.0s)]
*  your feet together, whatever. But he was going like, you're passing now. He's going, now you just [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=1473.44s)]
*  go to your regular internist. And then if you've got a problem, then you go to a specialist. And I [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=1478.16s)]
*  was like, well, I don't even have that. And so he introduced me to a new guy. But in any event, [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=1482.24s)]
*  going way back to me on the table, that doctor, Dr. Layden, he goes, you're having what they call [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=1487.0400000000002s)]
*  widow maker heart attack. You know what that is? And like, kind of self explanatory, but I was kind [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=1492.96s)]
*  of they had jacked me up on fentanyl. So I was like, no, geez, what is it? I was very chatty. [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=1497.76s)]
*  And he was like, it means in 80% of the cases where the patient has what you have, the patient [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=1503.76s)]
*  always dies. But you're going to be in the 20% because I'm good at my job. And he disappeared [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=1508.8799999999999s)]
*  into my crotch and made magic. That's how they get to your fucking heart is through your dick. [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=1512.48s)]
*  Is no way they use a catheter. They go through catheter. No, well, they go through your femoral. [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=1516.16s)]
*  They technically don't go through your dick was right next to his dick adjacent. Yeah, [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=1521.04s)]
*  close as possible. Like if somebody was fucking if you were like, lick me where they fucking put that [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=1524.24s)]
*  fuck, but lick me on my femoral. You're close enough to the deck where you might as well just [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=1528.48s)]
*  fucking go over and give that one as well. So they want right through the femoral to the heart. [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=1531.68s)]
*  And you know how they're always telling you like, oh boy, that a man's heart is stomach bullshit [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=1535.92s)]
*  right through the fucking deck. Science, right there. Science. So he told me that. And he had [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=1539.1200000000001s)]
*  always been afraid of dying. But like, you know, nothing I could do at that moment. Like all the [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=1544.88s)]
*  fucking damage had been done, whatever I'd eaten, fucking my genetics, whatever fuck led me to that [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=1549.92s)]
*  moment. So all the fucking like, why in the world wasn't going to help. So I just started facing the [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=1554.3200000000002s)]
*  fact like since I was looking up, I was like, this might be the last ceiling I see the rest of my [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=1559.2s)]
*  life. And this may be the last room I'm in. And what'd you wear? I was wearing a hockey jersey [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=1563.1200000000001s)]
*  because I was doing a special. I was doing a stand up special that eventually came out. It happened on [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=1567.44s)]
*  stage that you had a hard time. Not on stage. It was between two shows. Now when you're going to [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=1571.92s)]
*  tape a show, you shoot two shows and they put the best of it together. We shot our first show. [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=1575.92s)]
*  Then I went backstage and we had an hour before the next show. And in that hour, that's when it all [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=1580.72s)]
*  fucking happened. I was like sweating. I was like, can't fucking quite catch my breath and shit. [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=1585.44s)]
*  So while I was laying on the table, I got comfortable with the notion of dying, like dying. [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=1590.16s)]
*  Suddenly I was like, oh shit, this is like graduation. Like I left high school. Like if I [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=1594.56s)]
*  could leave this world, if I left high school and high school was fun and I hated to see it end, [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=1598.96s)]
*  if I left that, you know, and the shit worked out, I can leave this. There's an ending. Of course, [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=1602.96s)]
*  there's an ending to everything. There was a song fucking turn, turn, turn. You got this. Yeah. [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=1608.0800000000002s)]
*  Well, I don't know. I think it was the birds, but regardless, somebody will look it up for you. [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=1613.1200000000001s)]
*  So I was lying there and I was cool with the notion of like fucking dying. I [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=1621.68s)]
*  come to the total peace with it where I was like, you know what, man, like I have my time. [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=1626.0800000000002s)]
*  Like, and this is it. And like you had a real good life, better than fucking most. You used [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=1630.64s)]
*  some cool shit and whatnot. There I was. And I was like, so if this is the case. [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=1634.3200000000002s)]
*  You look handsome for a dying guy. Not bad, right? Well, I was on stage previously, right? [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=1638.0800000000002s)]
*  Right off stage. No makeup is still, but still. So I was like, if this is it, this is it, you know, [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=1642.64s)]
*  like you push back from the table, it won't be the last guy at the party. This is like, [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=1648.0s)]
*  Hey man, you got me a beer, like fuck off. And you had your time. So I was cool with that. [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=1650.96s)]
*  So I was okay with dying utterly a piece. I was like, if it ends, it ends. Did you get to talk [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=1655.76s)]
*  to anybody before? Sorry. The doctor, just the guy who was in my fucking crotch. Did you write a note [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=1659.8400000000001s)]
*  to a kid or to your children or no? Cause it was, it all happened so fast. Like my wife wasn't there. [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=1664.24s)]
*  The kid wasn't there. They didn't find out until after the fucking fact. So they had to get you on [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=1669.68s)]
*  the table immediately. So as soon as I got to that, they took me, picked me up from an ambulance from [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=1674.8s)]
*  the Alex theater in Glendale and took me, they're supposed to take me to a closer hospital as per [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=1678.8s)]
*  the shoot schedule. Like whenever you shoot a thing, there's like, this is where you gotta go. [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=1684.64s)]
*  If somebody gets hurt, that hospital was closer, but the first responders, the medics picked me up. [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=1688.4s)]
*  Motherfuckers saved my life. I don't even know their names. I gotta figure it out. You know what? [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=1694.0s)]
*  I gotta go out and find their names. These two kids came in backstage the Alex theater and they [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=1697.28s)]
*  were trying to put leads on me and shit. Which leads? You know, like the on your, on your chest [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=1703.6s)]
*  so they can measure your heart rate or whatever the fuck. So I was wearing a hockey jersey and [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=1708.32s)]
*  again, I was way heavier and shit and they lift up my shirt and I'm like, wow, man, fucking, you never [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=1711.92s)]
*  do that to a fucking heavy dude. And she goes, whoa, what are you talking about? And they're like, [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=1715.92s)]
*  we gotta get these on you. I was like, well, fucking I'll hold it out. You reach under, [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=1719.04s)]
*  but there's too many fucking people in the shit. So they did that. And once they took a reading, [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=1722.08s)]
*  like I do remember the woman looking at the man, like, you know, an unspoken look, you know, [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=1726.48s)]
*  I'm supposedly, I'm a director for a living and shit. So sometimes you got to frame somebody, [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=1733.68s)]
*  show a clue or whatever, something like that. You know, fucking just one of those, wasn't that shifty [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=1737.52s)]
*  where it's like, Oh, what does that mean? But I did see a glance between them. And then my man goes, [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=1742.16s)]

*  my, there it is. Go vegan. No, don't. That's your pitch for veganism. My pitch, if I had to pitch for [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=2553.84s)]
*  it, it would be like, you know, this is the, most people approach things from a position of vanity, [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=2558.7200000000003s)]
*  right? Like fucking, they don't really truly care about like their health. They just want to look [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=2565.36s)]
*  better. Oh, that's interesting. I feel that that's generally the case. So look, it was definitely the [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=2570.08s)]
*  case with me. And if we look better, we will feel better. One imagines, but, but really it's not [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=2575.84s)]
*  like my whole life prior to the heart attack, you know, I've been on a zillion diets and fucking [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=2582.48s)]
*  Optifast did any, everything but the surgery because I'm fucking scared of, you know, getting [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=2587.76s)]
*  cut and shit like that. So the light band surgery, you mean? Yeah. Yeah. So like, you know, [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=2592.4s)]
*  I've been that person that's like, man, what's the secret? How do you do it? And for years, [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=2598.4s)]
*  people have just been saying like, oh, you got to eat less and you got to exercise a lot more. I'm [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=2603.2000000000003s)]
*  like, yeah, I know. But what's the real secret shit? I was never interested in being healthy. [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=2606.32s)]
*  I just wanted to look normal, like everybody else. And now like I've lost weight, but I don't look [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=2610.2400000000002s)]
*  normal like everybody else. If I took my fucking gear off and shit, like I didn't sound like I [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=2615.52s)]
*  got any surgery. Like I got all this excess fucking skin that just hangs. Does that start [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=2620.4s)]
*  to go away? That skin? No. Can you put like vitamin E oil on it or something? I mean, [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=2625.12s)]
*  I maybe the stretch marks might go away, but like that hanging skin that just hangs. Is there any [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=2629.6s)]
*  way to absorb it back in or anything? I think so with the aid of unstable molecules, if we were [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=2634.32s)]
*  in a Marvel fucking comic, but no, bro, no, the skin being an organ, it just fucking distends. [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=2639.44s)]
*  And if you've distended it, that's it. So you could do this shit, but that's crazy. This is when you [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=2645.28s)]
*  go under the knife and they cut it off. And I've had a friend of mine, you know, I'm not a [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=2649.76s)]
*  libertarian, but a friend of mine went through that. And a friend of mine was like, because my [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=2653.5200000000004s)]

*  room and the gorgeous lady gets out of the tub and they start making out. And all of a sudden he [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=2707.84s)]

*  guarantee that anyone's ever going to be interested in your bullshit. I don't care who you are. Kevin [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=2743.2000000000003s)]

*  where the people didn't show up and stuff. So in a world where you can't guarantee that an audience [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=2774.4s)]
*  is going to show up, the only audience member you can go out of your way to please is audience member [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=2779.04s)]

*  had for 27 fucking years, is in that town. So you're talking about doing the Count Basie? [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=2898.48s)]
*  Yes. Count Basie Theater and the Vogel is right next door and shit like that. Yeah, that's where we went to. [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=2902.64s)]
*  Next time, no bullshit. Next time you do Count Basie, please let me know. I have a movie theater [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=2906.4s)]
*  that's like fucking 20 minutes from there, 15 minutes from there. You grew up going to- [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=2911.92s)]
*  It's the movie theater that I grew up going to with my friends and what my dad took me to when [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=2917.68s)]
*  I was a kid and whatnot. The one where I had- So cool. Oh, it's beautiful. And they were going to kill [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=2922.64s)]
*  it and close it after COVID. It's over 100 years old. So me and my friends got in and saved it. [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=2926.48s)]
*  It's called Smart Castle Cinemas and whatnot. And we do shit all the time. We just did Vulgar Thumb, [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=2931.28s)]
*  which is like show every Viewsque Universe movie. So Clerks, Mallrats, Chasing Amy, Dogma, [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=2936.16s)]
*  Jay and Silent Bob, Shrugged Back, Clerks 2, Jay and Silent Bob, Reboot, and Clerks 3. So eight movies, [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=2941.2s)]
*  16 hours of movies. We started at like Saturday morning at nine. We finished Sunday at like five [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=2946.32s)]
*  in the morning. 700 fucking people in four different theaters and shit like that. That's awesome, dude. [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=2952.88s)]
*  It's fun for shit like that. So we've had comedy there. I've done shows there. Somebody shot a [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=2958.0s)]
*  stand-up special there and whatnot. So if you're going to be in fucking Red Bank, oh my God, [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=2964.48s)]
*  I'll bring you over and we'll do a like watch with Theo thing. You pick a favorite movie and shit. [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=2969.36s)]
*  We'll show it and then you show up and then we just sit around bullshit. Dude, I would probably pick [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=2973.28s)]
*  Family Man. I like that movie. Have you seen it? With Nicolas Cage? Yeah. It's a beautiful fucking movie. [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=2977.44s)]
*  That's really a Brett Ratner movie that a lot of people never talk about anymore. [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=2982.24s)]
*  I thought that was one of his. If I remember correctly. But I remember the movie. It's very, [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=2986.24s)]
*  it's a Wonderful Life. Capra-esque. It's kind of like that vibe. Is that the shit you fuck with? [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=2990.64s)]
*  Yeah, I really like that. That's probably my favorite movie, I think. I like League of their Own. [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=2995.04s)]
*  I love League of their Own. I fucking lived across the street from Penny Marshall for years. [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=2999.8399999999997s)]
*  And when I was like in my heyday of podcasts and whatnot, we started doing it at the house all the [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=3006.0s)]
*  time. So she came over. So again, she like lived right across the street and shit. Penny Marshall, [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=3011.6s)]
*  bring her up. I got to talk to her about League of their Own. Just because Penny Marshall had this [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=3015.68s)]
*  brilliant like every once in a while, directors hit strong in threes and have like bang, bang, [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=3020.3199999999997s)]
*  bang. Penny Marshall had big awakenings and a League of their Own back to back to back. [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=3025.12s)]
*  She's a pretty fascinating lady. Just this was Laverne and Shirley. She was Laverne of Laverne [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=3031.36s)]
*  and Shirley. And then she became a director later and spent most of her career as a director after [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=3036.56s)]
*  doing that show for what? 10 seasons or whatever? Dude, we went to the town where [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=3041.7599999999998s)]
*  Rockford, we went to Rockford, Illinois and went to the museum there and went and saw like all the [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=3049.2s)]
*  Rockford Peaches memorabilia and shit. Are you serious? Yeah, it's pretty cool stuff. I love [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=3053.2s)]
*  that movie. Do you cry when you watch that movie? Are you allowed to cry? League of their Own? Yeah. [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=3057.6s)]
*  Are you a fucking butch dude and shit? No, I cry a lot. I get made fun of on the internet for crying. [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=3061.84s)]
*  Not only just crying, but then I post pictures of myself crying. I saw Black Panther 2. I came out, [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=3066.88s)]
*  I took a picture in front of the poster and I was teary eyed. Two days fucking the internet was like, [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=3071.84s)]
*  you cuck fuck. Like how dare you? They were very angry at me for that. Yeah, I cried. I mean, [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=3076.2400000000002s)]
*  if I saw it, yeah, I mean, I'll cry. I mean, yeah, I've cried. But you won't put it out there. I've [[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=3081.6800000000003s)]
*  been crying. I mean, yeah, there's too many clips of me crying online. Is that right? What makes you [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=3085.52s)]
*  cry? Oh, just like thinking about stuff or talking about stuff. Like, um, I don't know, [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=3090.64s)]
*  like earlier we were talking about like people pleasing, like thinking about, um, you got issues, [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=3096.0s)]
*  got MH issues, mental health. Oh yeah. First of all, hold on. There's a couple of questions I want [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=3100.24s)]
*  to ask. I don't forget. One is what are some of the signs if people are getting sick or something [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=3103.92s)]
*  that you feel like you neglected so that people can. Heart attack side or head side? Heart attack, [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=3108.48s)]
*  heart attack, heart attack, sweating profusely, which I did quite a lot as a man who was over [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=3112.96s)]
*  300 pounds. Um, not being able to catch your breath. I referred to it as I couldn't quite ring [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=3118.88s)]
*  the bell. Like, you know, you bang and fucking bang that game at the fucking fair. Yeah. Felt [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=3125.28s)]
*  like I'd be like bang hitting it hard and be like, and then just come back down. So I couldn't hit [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=3131.52s)]
*  the top. Couldn't quite catch my breath. So to speak. Um, I was looking for the numbness in the [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=3136.4s)]
*  arm because I was raised Washington fucking Sanford and son. So Lizbeth is the big one. And that's [[00:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=3142.96s)]
*  what he always did. Clutch his arm and did this shit that never happened. Never felt that nausea [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=3148.08s)]
*  also, like I wound up throwing up and I didn't have anything in my stomach. So it was just bile. [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=3153.6s)]
*  Um, these very subtle things that like, I hate bile, dude, totally. But you would, [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=3158.24s)]
*  you could mistake that for like, ah, nervous or fucking maybe I had some bad milks. I was a big [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=3162.7999999999997s)]
*  milk drinker in those days. So you could, nothing like a big fella drink milk, dude. Can we just, [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=3168.24s)]
*  you would have been turned on bro. Seriously. I don't know how, which way you swing. You [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=3174.96s)]
*  would have watched me drinking the milk on the beard and stuff. You've been like, I'm going bare [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=3178.56s)]
*  because you're a total otter type and it could have worked in the gay community. [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=3183.92s)]
*  Yeah. If I had to, yeah, like Scott Moser, people would always tell me, Hey man, he's there you go, [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=3188.64s)]
*  son. Come on. That looks like a good time. And I know a lot of people would look at that and be [[00:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=3193.76s)]
*  like, this guy's fucking nuts, but he's living his best fucking life. Have you ever been that happy? [[00:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=3197.92s)]
*  No, I've been listening to like that fucking song that was at the end of, [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=3202.72s)]
*  of guardians of the galaxy three and it's Florence and the machine and it's, uh, [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=3206.8s)]
*  keep going. Bullet in the back. Let's just stop and appreciate that. The poetry of that line. [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=3213.68s)]
*  All right. Happiness hit her like a bullet in the back. When was the last time you were ever hit [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=3221.68s)]
*  by the happiness bullet in the back? That's a good question. Man. I went to this recently. [[00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=3230.0s)]
*  I went to this, um, I mean happy too, like, cause you, I'm sure every day you wake up and you're [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=3234.08s)]
*  like, I'm Theo fucking fine. Like, holy shit, my mouth, I use my mouth on people and I'm rich now. [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=3238.16s)]
*  Yeah. And it's not for BJ and well, orals, oral, my friend, orals, you're in the mouth service [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=3242.88s)]
*  business painted any way you want. We're all whores. Yeah. But I'm not talking about being [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=3248.96s)]
*  satisfied with the job and stuff. I'm talking about like true fucking happiness that has nothing to do [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=3254.7999999999997s)]
*  with who you are. Like my friend Scott Moser at one point, he was just like, [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=3260.8799999999997s)]
*  what do you want to do? If you could do anything in the world, my cast cohost. Yeah. Uh, one of the [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=3264.3199999999997s)]
*  smartest people I've ever known. He said, if you could do anything you wanted, he's going, you almost [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=3270.16s)]
*  died a few years ago. So if you do anything you wanted, what would make you happy? And he goes, [[00:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=3274.56s)]
*  but it can't have anything to do with being Kevin Smith for a living or the movies or any of that. [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=3280.32s)]
*  He's gone. I'm just talking like normal ass shit. And that fucking, that rocked my world for a few [[00:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=3287.76s)]
*  days. I couldn't come up with an answer necessarily. The best answer I could come up with was I was like, [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=3293.04s)]
*  what would make me happy? Like if I had a conversation with my father and he's dead 20 [[00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=3297.6800000000003s)]
*  years and not because I'm like, we could settle issues, but that'd be fucking wonderful and shit. [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=3302.48s)]
*  But I had to reach into fiction into the impossible to find something. And I would ask other people, [[00:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=3306.4s)]
*  I asked my brother, my brother without missing a beat. He's like, oh, I go on a world cruise. [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=3312.64s)]
*  And I was like, what's that? He's like, exactly what it sounds like. You just cruise around the [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=3317.04s)]
*  world for like a year. Yeah. On a boat. But he knew and I've other people I've talked to were like, [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=3319.76s)]
*  oh, I do this. It's a good question. Normal ass things that are within one's doing. And I think [[00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=3325.6800000000003s)]
*  my fucking radar is busted. And I imagine yours is as well, because the idea of what makes others [[00:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=3332.56s)]
*  happy or what makes a person happy is shattered when you can wake up and whimsy about something [[00:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=3340.0s)]
*  and create it. And just by dreaming about it and doing it, we're putting the podcast together, [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=3347.52s)]
*  sitting around speaking your mind. You've gotten paid and you've gotten a bunch of people going [[00:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=3352.7999999999997s)]
*  like, we fucking like what we support you and shit like that. When that scale exists, [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=3358.0s)]
*  it's I found and I, the more I speak to other creatives, like after the fucking going to the [[00:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=3365.6s)]
*  mental hospital, now I feel freer to talk to others about it and shit where it's like, [[00:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=3371.2s)]
*  I'm not saying like life can't make you happy. But when you've had that ability, and there's a [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=3377.84s)]
*  certain happiness that goes along with financial success, creative success, personal success, [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=3384.88s)]
*  when your highs are like, oh, let's get Alan Rickman to be in dogma. [[00:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=3393.92s)]
*  It's tough to find a normal high. You know what I'm saying? Like, [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=3401.44s)]
*  Yeah, it's interesting. Is that 1% fucking rarefied view thinking? [[00:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=3407.44s)]
*  No, I don't know if I feel- [[00:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=3414.4s)]
*  Does that make me instantly unrelatable? [[00:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=3415.76s)]
*  No, I just think it makes sense. Like if you've had interesting things that would most people would [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=3417.6800000000003s)]
*  seem like would make people happy or we all believe would make us happy, then it makes sense then that [[00:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=3423.76s)]
*  you might have a tougher time finding certain happiness, you know? I don't know what I would [[00:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=3431.92s)]
*  do. Something that would really, really make me happy. I don't know. [[00:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=3437.2000000000003s)]
*  Isn't that crazy? You can ask anybody listening to the show. [[00:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=3445.44s)]
*  Maybe giving a hug to my brother or something like that, or taking a walk with my brother [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=3448.2400000000002s)]
*  somewhere. [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=3452.2400000000002s)]
*  Is your brother, you know your brother type? [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=3452.64s)]
*  Yeah, we're close. So I think something like that. What else? Spending time with [[00:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=3455.44s)]
*  like a teacher or something that I grew up with. Yeah, probably if I got to see my dad again or [[00:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=3462.48s)]
*  something like that. I mean, that's, you know, my dad passed away too. So like, yeah, I think if [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=3468.64s)]
*  there was something like that, I think it would make me like really happy. Maybe having a- [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=3472.7200000000003s)]
*  Isn't it crazy that we have to reach into the grave to be like, well, that would make me really [[00:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=3477.04s)]
*  happy. But also- [[00:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=3480.8s)]
*  Essentially the impossible. [[00:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=3482.08s)]
*  Being in love with somebody probably. [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=3483.2000000000003s)]
*  Are you? [[00:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=3485.44s)]
*  No, I'm not. I have a tough- [[00:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=3486.08s)]
*  I have a tough like- [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=3488.56s)]
*  Dick? [[00:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=3490.48s)]
*  I wish, huh? [[00:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=3491.2799999999997s)]
*  Tough dick. The chicks are like, I ain't into that tough dick shit. Look at this. [[00:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=3492.16s)]
*  That's what my dick does. Tough. [[00:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=3496.4s)]
*  My dick has a brass- just one brass knuckle on it. No, I don't know. Yeah, probably having a [[00:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=3498.72s)]
*  family- being able to be happy and have a family shit like that. [[00:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=3503.44s)]
*  Wouldn't one brass knuckle essentially be a cock ring? [[00:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=3506.24s)]
*  Yeah, probably would. [[00:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=3508.64s)]
*  But you know what? I think I like yourself better. Because cock rings, some people are like, [[00:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=3510.16s)]
*  I don't fuck with that. But if you're like, how would you like one brass knuckle on your dick? [[00:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=3513.44s)]
*  A lot of people are like, as long as it's my choice, I don't want your brass knuckle on my dick. [[00:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=3516.32s)]
*  When you think about businesses that are selling through the roof, like A-Lo or Allbirds or Skims [[00:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=3521.36s)]
*  or what's the one like those little yogurts? Well, usually you think about a specific product, [[00:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=3529.52s)]
*  a cool brand and brilliant marketing. But an often overlooked secret is actually the business [[00:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=3539.04s)]
*  behind the business, making selling simple. For millions of businesses, that business is [[00:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=3545.52s)]
*  Shopify. Nobody does selling better than Shopify, home of the number one checkout on the planet [[00:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=3552.88s)]

*  You know it. I'm okay. I'm alive, thankfully. But one thing I want to do when I look at my future [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=3603.6800000000003s)]
*  is I want to have good habits in it. I want to have a healthy future. Did you know that around [[01:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=3612.16s)]
*  73% of American adults report having one or more unhealthy behavior? If you've got a bad habit that [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=3618.64s)]
*  you can't seem to kick, you might want to pay attention to what fume has created for people [[01:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=3625.92s)]
*  like us. Fume is a vaping alternative. Fume is an award-winning flavored air device that's quickly [[01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=3632.88s)]
*  becoming the leading alternative to vaping and smoking. It's a new movement which champions the [[01:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=3641.44s)]
*  creation and maintenance of healthy habits that you can implement into your daily routine. I've [[01:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=3647.44s)]
*  used fume and it is effective. Flavored air isn't like vaping. If vapor was compared to sticky soda, [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=3654.72s)]
*  fume cores are closer to herbal teas. Fume has lots of delicious flavors to choose from like crisp [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=3664.0s)]
*  mint and orange vanilla. There's a cranberry one as well as a grapefruit one. Those are the ones I've [[01:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=3670.7999999999997s)]

*  have been a big comic guy and in that whole zeitgeist and it's been a big part of what made you [[01:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=3701.2s)]
*  awesome, right? Honestly, like I was into that shit. Like if you watch Mallrats in 95, [[01:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=3707.44s)]
*  it's a big part of it and stuff. And the culture wasn't. Like the culture was like comic books. [[01:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=3712.16s)]
*  Those are for kids. I just got real fucking lucky in that, you know, about 15 years ago, [[01:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=3716.3999999999996s)]
*  the culture shifted into all the shit that I was already into and well versed in. So I got like a [[01:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=3720.7999999999997s)]
*  free fucking ride for about a good 15, 20 years on a geek training that like I never had to make [[01:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=3727.2799999999997s)]
*  a comic book. Right. I've directed some comic shows like Supergirl Flash and stuff like that. [[01:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=3732.64s)]
*  But like really it's just I was insanely well positioned because I was waving the flag for [[01:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=3737.52s)]
*  this shit when people were like, what do you mean? Yeah. Yeah. That's lucky when we're what you do. [[01:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=3742.4s)]
*  Very lucky when the culture. Yes. It's the same. Do you feel that is where you are right now? [[01:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=3747.92s)]
*  No, I see. Do you feel you were an overnight success or it was like 10 years of a thing before [[01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=3753.04s)]
*  fucking? Oh yeah. It was for, it was a long time. You don't feel you're in the fucking zone right [[01:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=3757.84s)]
*  now? Like in terms of like the man has met the moment and vice versa. I don't know. I guess [[01:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=3762.0s)]
*  because I don't know what my, what my end goals are sometimes. I see it when I look at a guy like [[01:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=3767.84s)]
*  Joe Rogan to drop his name again, and you can use it a few times too, twice, twice in one, but [[01:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=3773.36s)]
*  because he got into UFC and that rose and I think it wrote, he helped. He also helped. Yeah. And, [[01:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=3779.76s)]
*  but I'm saying I'm Joe Rogan, but I too, but it's what I'm saying. It's a labor of love. [[01:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=3786.96s)]
*  Just like, that's what I'm saying. Once again, though, reminds me of that. He found a way to [[01:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=3791.52s)]
*  monetize his passions where I think he's probably indispensable to the UFC. When he comments, [[01:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=3795.84s)]
*  do they pay him? I'm pretty sure they have a, they must have a deal. Like not only he may have put [[01:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=3803.2s)]
*  in the work and shit, but now he's financially, he was fighting. He was in on an early, he trained [[01:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=3808.88s)]
*  early and he started talking. I remember going like the kids at my school that you knew were [[01:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=3814.24s)]
*  going to probably die young or whatever they say. They were the ones watching that on the weekend [[01:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=3818.96s)]
*  and like, come watch it. It's like, it's like, you know, Willie, the fucking, you know, short Willie [[01:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=3825.6s)]
*  versus fucking, uh, versus the violent homo or something like that's like, who are these guys? [[01:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=3831.28s)]
*  And it would be like one guy would be like 400 pounds fighting a guy that was like 120 pounds. [[01:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=3836.8s)]
*  And it would just be like a massacre, you know, but that's when the UFC, there wasn't weight classes, [[01:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=3841.44s)]
*  all of that. And so look at, look at them. What a puppet. It's like his news radio days. [[01:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=3845.6s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, he's my, I believe me, I understand who Joe Rogan is today and I love that, but, [[01:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=3850.16s)]
*  but you know, back then, well, I mean, my first introduction to Joe Rogan was on news radio and [[01:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=3856.7999999999997s)]
*  I fucking love news radio. It's one of my favorite sitcoms ever produced. So I've watched, they only [[01:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=3862.56s)]
*  had about four seasons max or something. So you could, it's not like, you know, fucking friends [[01:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=3867.7599999999998s)]
*  where you could do 12 seasons. You could get through it in a day and then start it again and [[01:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=3873.6s)]
*  shit. So Joe was like, that's how I first knew him and knew about him and stuff. And then the [[01:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=3879.36s)]
*  podcasting thing, you know, I remember going on the show in the early days and every time I've [[01:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=3884.3199999999997s)]
*  ever been on and he's, you know, clearly there's a reason why the fucking man is at the top of the [[01:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=3889.12s)]
*  game. He's just interesting and interested. He's interested. He's genuinely curious. Yeah, [[01:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=3894.0s)]
*  that's the worst. But he's, he's curious, but he also like fucking hits you with shit where you're [[01:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=3900.16s)]
*  like, no, like he's just that guy at the party where he's, you know, slowly the crowd gravitates [[01:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=3903.92s)]
*  around him, whether he's trying to magnetize him in, whether he's putting on a show or not. [[01:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=3912.3199999999997s)]
*  Cause it's just interesting. Got a lot of information. He's like a thoroughfare for [[01:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=3916.64s)]
*  information. He's like an airport for information and he retains information really well. And he's [[01:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=3920.3999999999996s)]
*  genuinely curious. You'll kind of say something and then he'll ask you about it. And you're almost [[01:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=3924.56s)]
*  like, fuck, now I have to say something about this. He was the first one that did this shit though, [[01:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=3927.44s)]
*  where somebody you're talking and then all of a sudden he's like, look that up. And somebody, [[01:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=3932.4s)]
*  somebody listens and reference person, like helping out. Um, we didn't have that in them [[01:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=3936.4s)]
*  early days. Yeah. I, uh, a lot of the, like, I feel like there's less comedy movies these days. [[01:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=3940.56s)]
*  Would you agree with that? No, I think there are less movies period. Okay. Is it a lot of like, [[01:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=3947.68s)]
*  there's a lot of almost comic book type movies and universes that are the, those are the movies [[01:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=3956.4s)]
*  now. Does that feel weird to you? Because they're not weird to your, like, what are your thoughts [[01:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=3962.64s)]
*  on that? That it's like, I don't know if one like, like has eliminated the other, but it's just kind [[01:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=3966.8s)]
*  of, um, like, why is that? Why do we see these big, huge things? But it's, it feels tougher to, [[01:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=3974.48s)]
*  for somebody to create, um, just like a good comedy these days. I think good comedy went [[01:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=3982.64s)]
*  TV into streaming, um, cause they needed to fill coffers quick, you know, fill programming [[01:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=3990.4s)]
*  schedules quick. So, or like did there's a lot of Marvel universes and all the comic book [[01:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=3996.32s)]
*  universes, did they kill off like this, the guy a hundred percent? No, uh, the studios [[01:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=4000.72s)]
*  like to make money, right in the business to make money. I don't think a comic book movie [[01:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=4007.84s)]
*  has made them go like, let's give up on the middle mid range. They're just like, look, [[01:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=4012.32s)]
*  more risk, more reward. And then when I first started, you had, there was television, [[01:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=4016.7200000000003s)]
*  there was movies. Now there are many more options and many more places to go. So instead of doing, [[01:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=4021.6000000000004s)]
*  you know, and you'll see it like an eight or six or eight episode show where you're like, [[01:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=4028.4s)]
*  could have done in three. It's because like a lot of people are like, all right, I'm going to take [[01:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=4033.2000000000003s)]
*  my idea that was for a feature and stretch it out into a show. So I think, you know, nevermind [[01:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=4037.04s)]
*  comedy, I'd be more curious, Hey, where'd the indie film go? Yeah. Um, but I think the indie film [[01:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=4044.32s)]
*  moved, uh, was taken over by Netflix. Once Netflix came in, number one, they started buying cheap [[01:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=4052.48s)]
*  movies and number two, they started making programming. That was kind of interesting. [[01:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=4058.8s)]
*  They went to other countries and they were like, who are your top filmmakers? Here's money. Go make [[01:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=4063.12s)]
*  TV shows and stuff. And that's where all the interesting ideas are going and finding a home. [[01:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=4066.64s)]
*  You're somebody who wants to tell an offbeat story and you're looking at this Sisyphean task of like, [[01:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=4072.8799999999997s)]
*  I gotta roll this boulder up the hill. Like every time I make a movie, it's like, [[01:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=4078.8799999999997s)]
*  fuck, here we go. It's going to be fucking tough. Or you walk into these cats and they're like, [[01:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=4083.12s)]
*  what's it about? How esoteric is it? Interesting. Go ahead. Can you make it six episodes? Can you [[01:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=4088.3199999999997s)]
*  make it eight? That's preferable. And that's where all the interesting programming has slowly [[01:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=4094.4s)]
*  gravitated to now. So you're saying some of the indie movies have actually become television [[01:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=4100.32s)]
*  shows. I think indie filmmakers or people that make things off the beaten path stories that don't [[01:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=4104.4s)]
*  necessarily fall into the big budget equation have wound up going to streaming. Like, you know, [[01:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=4109.68s)]
*  what was fucking a Jason Bateman show? Ozark. Yeah. It's an indie film. This just happens to be a [[01:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=4115.92s)]
*  series that went on for a bunch of episodes because they're like, Hey, we like it. Do it again. [[01:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=4121.6s)]
*  Instead of getting a sequel, you just get another season. That's a good point. It's like, it was [[01:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=4125.360000000001s)]
*  almost like there's a secret gay guy at the lake. It was like people playing gay clue at the lake. [[01:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=4128.8s)]
*  Remember? Cause like that one guy in Ozark. Yeah. I didn't watch the whole show. And it started to [[01:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=4133.280000000001s)]
*  get redundant. Like it started to get, for some reason I really want to play gay clue. Does that [[01:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=4139.200000000001s)]
*  exist? No, they should have that. Right? Right. Like he did it. Yeah. It was, it was like, what [[01:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=4143.76s)]
*  do you use the candlestick for? They're like, find out. Samuel's been in the billiard room for a while [[01:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=4149.84s)]
*  in the conservatory, not being very conservative. Wow. I've never used that to, uh, queue my pool [[01:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=4157.6s)]
*  stick before. What's that thing called to chalk? I've never chalked that way. Yeah. Um, so, so [[01:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=4163.360000000001s)]
*  you're, so that's interesting. I think, I think that's part of it. Believe me, I'm not like, [[01:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=4171.04s)]
*  and that's exactly what happened. And now it's cool. I think that's part of it. I think, you know, [[01:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=4174.08s)]
*  Netflix came in, disrupted the business as we all know, in a, in a way that at first people were [[01:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=4178.8s)]
*  like, yeah. And now people are like, wait a second. In the aftermath, nothing existed the way that [[01:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=4184.24s)]
*  existed before. Television viewership is like down to almost nothing so much so that major studios [[01:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=4189.2s)]
*  are writing off entire network divisions and stuff like that, devaluing television in order to get a [[01:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=4196.08s)]
*  write off. So once Netflix came in and said, Hey, this is how we're doing it. And then every other [[01:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=4202.64s)]
*  company was like, well, shit, we got to do what they're doing. And they started doing streaming [[01:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=4208.96s)]
*  and whatnot. It just really, it broke the model. It's kind of nuts. So right now, I think if you're [[01:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=4212.0s)]
*  a person that likes to tell off the beaten path stories, or if what we used to call back in the [[01:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=4220.0s)]
*  day, an indie filmmaker, now's the time to shine. I think there's a moment that's going on right now [[01:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=4224.160000000001s)]
*  where entertainment, like the way people are getting their entertainment, of course, is [[01:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=4229.28s)]
*  completely changed over the last 10 years. But theatrical consumption has been way off since [[01:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=4233.04s)]
*  COVID. And some people wonder if like, will people ever go back to movies the way they used to and [[01:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=4238.0s)]
*  blah, blah, blah. They're not going to go unless you give them something they can't get any place [[01:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=4242.48s)]
*  else. So they'll go to the theaters to see Deadpool Wolverine. Cause like, I'm going to be able to [[01:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=4247.28s)]
*  watch this at home for like six months. So fuck it. But what if you tell them a story going back to [[01:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=4251.5199999999995s)]
*  your voice as your currency they've never heard before. And the only place they could see it is [[01:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=4256.8s)]
*  in theater. And right now theaters are hurting. So they'll fucking take anybody. It doesn't matter. [[01:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=4260.8s)]
*  It used to be tough to get screens. Now are you fucking kidding me? You can make a deal with AMC, [[01:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=4265.28s)]
*  private deal with your own independent movie where you're like, I can I get a hundred screens [[01:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=4270.24s)]
*  and we'll do a door split or whatever the fuck it's possible because movie theaters as a movie [[01:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=4274.8s)]
*  theater exhibitor, I know this for a fact, we would kill or die to have people come in. You know, back [[01:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=4279.6s)]
*  in the day I made this movie, the 430 movie and it's about how in the 80s, this is the new film [[01:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=4283.2s)]
*  that's coming out September 13th. In the 80s we used to pay for one movie and then jump from theater [[01:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=4288.639999999999s)]
*  to theater to theater and go see movies for free. I own that movie theater that I used to do that [[01:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=4294.16s)]
*  and we get caught. You might get the risk of being banned from that theater for fucking life. If I [[01:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=4299.76s)]
*  caught you walking into another movie theater after you paid for only one movie theater, my movie [[01:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=4305.2s)]
*  theater, I'd be like, that's great. Just buy some popcorn. Would you? You could stay as long as you [[01:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=4309.76s)]
*  fucking want. Call your friends. Yeah. Have them come just to get fucking bodies through the goddamn [[01:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=4313.6s)]
*  door. So it's, it's yeah, this is a bit of a different world at this point, but imagine you're [[01:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=4318.320000000001s)]
*  an indie filmmaker who wants to say the thing nobody has ever fucking said before in a film per [[01:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=4324.08s)]
*  se. We're just using film as an example. Fuck. Now is your time. Like you could actually make a thing [[01:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=4330.72s)]
*  and have it be in a goddamn movie theater. And then if you do even the tiniest bit of business [[01:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=4336.64s)]
*  with your movie in a movie theater these days, that's a fucking story. Yeah. And that also has, [[01:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=4340.96s)]
*  it's been proven like through the algorithm when Amazon did air Ben Affleck's movie air, [[01:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=4345.92s)]
*  they put it in theaters and they spent AIR about Air Jordans, the history of the air sneaker. [[01:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=4353.12s)]
*  They put it in theaters traditionally and spent money on advertising, even though Amazon has prime [[01:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=4359.84s)]
*  and really they probably thought it would go right there, but they were like, you know what, [[01:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=4365.44s)]
*  let's see what it would be like to release a movie. Like, you know, Amazon and other streamers [[01:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=4369.919999999999s)]
*  broke the theatrical model and here they're going like, wouldn't it be novel? Like us with [[01:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=4375.28s)]
*  Smodcast going like, wouldn't it be weird if somebody paid for an ad on our show? These cats [[01:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=4379.5199999999995s)]
*  are like, wouldn't it be novel if we put the movie out and paid for ads and people saw a trailer [[01:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=4383.5199999999995s)]
*  and then went to the movies theater to see it? Would it make it more valuable when we then put [[01:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=4388.32s)]
*  it on prime? And it did naturally. They found the same thing out on Netflix, movies that go [[01:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=4393.12s)]
*  the traditional route, the way that everybody expects. I've seen a commercial for that on TV. [[01:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=4398.8s)]
*  That will be a primary choice on Netflix rather than a Netflix made for Netflix movie that may [[01:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=4403.04s)]
*  have the biggest fucking stars on the planet in it, but you will pass it by. Yeah. So there's [[01:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=4409.04s)]
*  something about just watching a movie that's just on Netflix or on a street. Isn't that crazy? Yeah. [[01:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=4414.64s)]
*  But there is a value to putting something in a theater still. It gives it this kind of panache. [[01:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=4419.44s)]
*  Now, if you're an indie filmmaker and you're out there going like, nobody's ever fucking heard [[01:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=4425.28s)]
*  my story. They've never heard my voice. They've never fucking seen what I can do. And if you're [[01:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=4429.44s)]
*  sitting there right now going, I fucking hate Kevin Smith. He makes the same fucking movie [[01:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=4434.639999999999s)]
*  every time. 30 years in the business. All he's done is make Clarkson J and Son of Bob. Great. [[01:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=4438.08s)]
*  Now's your fucking time. Now's your time to shine. Don't sit there, waste your time at home looking [[01:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=4441.839999999999s)]
*  at me, hating on me. Use me as your fucking example and stepping stone. Like if that fucking [[01:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=4446.4s)]
*  talentless idiot could do it, then I could fucking do it too. And now is the time for another indie [[01:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=4450.799999999999s)]
*  filmmaker, indie filmmaking movement. Now it feels like with the frustration of real fucking [[01:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=4456.16s)]
*  filmmakers who I know people that make millions to fucking make movies sitting on our asses. [[01:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=4461.839999999999s)]
*  Cause ain't nobody fucking making movies. Could you imagine if some, if the only way you got to [[01:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=4466.16s)]
*  do your show is if somebody told you, okay, now you could go. No, you enjoy the independence of [[01:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=4470.4s)]
*  like fucking this past weekend is going to happen when I want it to fucking happen. You're your own [[01:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=4475.12s)]
*  fucking boss. There are a lot of people that never figured out how to do that. They never came from [[01:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=4479.44s)]
*  indie films. They couldn't pivot back to indie film. They've just been spoiled by working for [[01:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=4483.04s)]
*  a studio. So now with the studios not making anything, they're like, what do I fucking do? [[01:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=4486.72s)]
*  I've always been able to pivot back to indie film. And I feel like even though I've been able to do [[01:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=4491.68s)]
*  that, I've been in indie film for a while. Everyone knows every variation of story I could possibly [[01:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=4496.08s)]
*  tell every once in a while you'll whip a Tuscan. And we're like, well, that's fucking weird. But [[01:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=4499.84s)]
*  generally speaking, like he does those James Allen Bob movies and shit. Now is the time for [[01:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=4503.2s)]
*  an indie filmmaker to come out and be like, here's a fucking story. Nobody's ever heard. Fuck a tic [[01:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=4507.44s)]
*  tac. I mean, I love tic tac. Don't get me wrong, but like people that spend their time like doing [[01:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=4511.36s)]
*  little videos and shit. If you're a filmmaker, make your fucking film. And now is the time to [[01:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=4516.32s)]
*  take your fucking shot because there is an empty guff in the marketplace for that type of storytelling. [[01:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=4521.84s)]
*  All of it has gone mainstream streaming is now mainstream. So people who are telling these off [[01:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=4529.44s)]
*  beat stories on streamers, they are essentially studios at this point. When I started in indie [[01:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=4535.36s)]
*  film, it was like us outside of Warner Brothers and fucking 20th Century Fox and Paramount going like, [[01:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=4540.0s)]
*  well, they'll never let us play. So just because they won't let us in, don't mean I can't do it on [[01:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=4545.839999999999s)]
*  my own. Streamers of that now. So if you're out there going like, well, Netflix will never give [[01:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=4550.719999999999s)]
*  me a fucking thing. Great. Go do your fucking thing without them. Hang your own fucking shingle. [[01:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=4554.72s)]
*  It's time. People are hungry for that. Do you think it's a good idea to sell direct to consumer? [[01:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=4559.6s)]
*  Right? Like, yes, David Spade and I wrote a movie and so we're going to try to get it made and it [[01:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=4564.4800000000005s)]
*  feels like it's kind of getting close. Right. So, and we're like, could we just put it on a website [[01:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=4568.64s)]
*  and sell it right there to people? But also you travel out in the world, man. And so imagine you [[01:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=4573.4400000000005s)]
*  do a comedy tour, but instead your comedy tour is, hey man, welcome tonight. We're going to watch [[01:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=4579.04s)]
*  a movie and afterwards we're going to talk about it. All right. So enjoy the show. And then you get [[01:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=4584.88s)]
*  to fuck off for 90 minutes. Then you come out and it's all crowd work because you're just answering [[01:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=4588.08s)]
*  fucking questions. That's it. You have the ability to do that. Why do you fucking need anybody else? [[01:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=4592.72s)]
*  Or you've got such an audience and such a long tail that you can go into an AMC like a fucking [[01:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=4598.16s)]
*  Taylor Swift and be like, I guarantee you that on my podcast that has 200 fucking million downloads [[01:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=4603.52s)]
*  per ever, whatever the fuck that I can make people come to a theater and show a thing. And even if [[01:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=4608.96s)]
*  AMC is like, no, we're interested. Then you go to fathom events and be like, Hey man, I got a movie. [[01:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=4613.52s)]
*  I want to put it in screens for like two fucking days and you'll make like 10 million bucks and [[01:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=4618.160000000001s)]
*  they'll write stories about how fucking smart you are. So you don't need anybody. Theo, you have [[01:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=4622.320000000001s)]
*  the distribution fucking mechanism already in place. You're a loaded gun at all times. You just [[01:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=4627.92s)]
*  have to point your audience in the right direction. And what you do is point them to the next show, [[01:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=4632.48s)]
*  the next show or a live gig. But if you make a movie with spade or whoever the fuck, [[01:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=4636.5599999999995s)]
*  don't fucking sell it until you have milked it and juiced it for everything you personally can, [[01:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=4641.36s)]
*  the way you juice your own shit, then fucking give it up to a streamer, then give it up to somebody [[01:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=4646.5599999999995s)]
*  like a home video company that's going to put it out and shit like that. Because you have the [[01:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=4651.28s)]
*  mechanism in place. You already know how to put asses in seats. The big mystery of this business [[01:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=4655.679999999999s)]
*  that everyone's always trying to figure out is how do I get fucking people to show up? [[01:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=4660.0s)]
*  You know how to get people to show up. Now this would just be going, okay, when you show up this [[01:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=4663.36s)]
*  time, we're going to do things a little differently. I'm just going to show you a movie and then we're [[01:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=4667.44s)]
*  going to fucking do a comedy show afterwards and stuff. You get charged the same thing and all that [[01:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=4670.48s)]
*  money goes right to the fucking flick. And then you would have a student, then you would have money [[01:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=4674.4s)]
*  now. Then you could start making other cool movies and have your friends be like, this is a script I [[01:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=4678.16s)]
*  like, or you could just write it. And then it's like, you'd have movies would be like free again, [[01:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=4683.6s)]
*  because there wouldn't be, yeah, you don't have to go and ask some smarmy fucking dude. [[01:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=4687.6s)]
*  What do you mean free again? Because I'm like, I like this world. Free meaning you could do [[01:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=4693.200000000001s)]
*  whatever you want. You can do what you want. But you could always do whatever you want. You have [[01:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=4697.360000000001s)]
*  the ability to do that. You just have to figure your deals together. But you already show it [[01:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=4701.120000000001s)]
*  on a regular basis. You are, again, I cannot fucking stress this enough. That Celsius fucking [[01:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=4705.200000000001s)]

*  Like, so I'm just going to make the movie I want to make, fuck everything else. And that was Jane, [[01:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=5310.320000000001s)]
*  song, Bob reboot. And so we had to go to Louisiana. We couldn't do it in Jersey because it's a road [[01:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=5313.76s)]
*  movie and stuff like that. And Louisiana had a fantastic fucking rebate that a great fucking crew [[01:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=5318.08s)]
*  man. And the people were so fucking wonderful and shit. And we shot during Mardi Gras. So we took two [[01:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=5322.8s)]
*  days down. We actually shot on Mardi Gras at the courthouse because they were like, that's the only [[01:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=5328.24s)]
*  day we're closed. We're like, great. We'll use the courthouse that day. But everyone was so fucking [[01:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=5331.84s)]
*  cool, man. And I didn't even fuck with the party half of the city, like the cast and people who [[01:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=5336.16s)]
*  flew in to be in the movie and shit. They would go to like, I went to Bourbon street and shit. [[01:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=5341.5199999999995s)]
*  I didn't even get that fucking far, man. It was just like, you know, work probably too. [[01:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=5345.92s)]
*  When you're putting a movie together, it's a lot. How do you know when, like, [[01:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=5349.04s)]
*  like when you're ramping up to do a movie, things get pretty intense, pretty quick, right? And then [[01:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=5353.68s)]
*  there's just that day where you have to start. How crazy is that first day? Because that's such a, [[01:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=5359.360000000001s)]
*  I mean, it's rare that there's such a huge leap that's going to be so, you can't go back. Like [[01:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=5364.8s)]
*  you are moving forward. It's begun. You spend so much time trying to get to that moment that when [[01:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=5370.72s)]
*  the moment happens, you're already prepared. You better be fucking prepared. If you're not, [[01:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=5377.360000000001s)]
*  it's like, what the fuck are you crying about all this time? Like you knew this was coming. You [[01:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=5381.04s)]
*  pushed for it. You wanted this. Right. That's why like after everything I do, no matter whether it [[01:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=5384.56s)]
*  works or doesn't work, there's two things I always say to myself and generally is more helpful. If [[01:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=5390.0s)]
*  it doesn't, if it didn't work, one is like, you wanted this, like, oh my God, you change the course [[01:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=5394.88s)]
*  of human events to make this fucking movie happen and shit. Like you dreamed about this. You somehow [[01:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=5403.28s)]
*  found millions of dollars and convinced people to give up their time, do this fucking make, [[01:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=5409.52s)]
*  pretend with you. So it don't matter if it didn't do what you want. You wanted this. You better [[01:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=5413.4400000000005s)]
*  fucking enjoy it because it's going to pass quick. And then the second thing I always tell myself is [[01:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=5417.68s)]
*  like, what was the alternative? Did you even have an alternative? Was the alternative to not do the [[01:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=5420.96s)]
*  thing? Then that's not the alternative because knowing that I could do the thing and knowing [[01:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=5426.0s)]
*  that I could accomplish it and then not doing the thing would eat at me like a fucking cancer. [[01:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=5430.160000000001s)]
*  That's sad when you know you can accomplish things, but you don't do it because you're like, [[01:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=5434.8s)]
*  no, well, fucking what if somebody don't like it? Like I mentioned before, [[01:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=5438.16s)]
*  scary though is all creativity scary. But think about that's why this is a safe environment. [[01:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=5443.44s)]
*  You create a thing where you're like, these are my rules, my house. And I don't have, you don't worry [[01:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=5450.08s)]
*  when a new episode goes up, you don't even think about it. You feel like, oh, I recorded that a [[01:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=5456.24s)]
*  couple of days ago or last week or something like that. But you're so you've built the thing for [[01:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=5460.08s)]
*  yourself that is so fucking foolproof and you can avoid sidestep the world of rejection and the world [[01:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=5464.24s)]
*  of no. You went to her and you created a world of yes for yourself. So you don't have that weird [[01:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=5469.5199999999995s)]
*  trepidation at the beginning of every show because you're like, this is exactly engineered this to be [[01:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=5474.08s)]
*  as easy for me as fucking breathing and shit. When you're making a flick or something like that, [[01:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=5480.08s)]
*  there are way more people involved in shit. And you've also been dying to do this. Sometimes [[01:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=5484.88s)]
*  it's taken 10 years to get to that amazing moment. We've been working on this from trying to get this [[01:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=5489.76s)]
*  movie together. All the agents haven't done anything. So finally we got some of our own friends [[01:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=5494.0s)]
*  and stuff and we're going to put in some of our own money. That's what I was going to say. Like, [[01:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=5499.6s)]
*  dude, based on that Celsius case, there's no fucking way that you don't have enough of your own [[01:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=5503.36s)]
*  fucking. You probably got it in your pocket. Just be like, Oh, I wish dude, you can have that thing, [[01:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=5508.8s)]
*  brother. It is, it is, it is so possible to do. I tell my kid all the time, my kid who, again, I [[01:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=5514.16s)]
*  fucking your daughter, my daughter, Harley. She's in a, she's in one of the movies. She's in Quentin's [[01:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=5523.2s)]
*  movie. I always lead with that. She's been in a bunch of my movies, but nobody gives a fuck about [[01:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=5527.92s)]
*  Kevin Smith. She was in once upon a time in Hollywood. So I always leave with that. She was [[01:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=5531.28s)]
*  in the Quentin Tarantino movie. Believe me, she leads with that too. She never leads with like, [[01:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=5535.2s)]
*  yeah, I was in Jay and Silent Bob reboot, but she played Jay's daughter in Jay and Silent Bob. [[01:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=5539.36s)]
*  What was the one was she at? Was that who? Yoga hosers. The fuck out of, I mean, you think I got [[01:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=5543.679999999999s)]
*  beat up for putting a picture of myself crying on the internet. Yoga hosers. I got fucking, [[01:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=5549.36s)]
*  ooh, they were like bend over and it went in dry. So dry. I got, I remember AV club was like, [[01:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=5553.28s)]
*  Ew, Kevin Smith and Johnny Depp are going to force us to watch a playdate with their children. [[01:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=5558.48s)]
*  And it's like, bro, you don't have to watch it. But I've, you know, that was, I've been around the [[01:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=5563.04s)]
*  internet for a while. So I've watched the culture get like way more toxic. And here's the thing. [[01:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=5566.5599999999995s)]
*  For as long as I've been online, I've been online since 1996, right? So I remember the first troll [[01:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=5571.44s)]
*  where it's like, what? Yeah. Why would you spend time here? And you've got one of the first trolls [[01:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=5576.88s)]
*  ever. Legit. A hundred percent. I remember there was a dude, I reached out to a troll, [[01:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=5581.6s)]
*  like to try to understand. And this was a dude who was on, um, ain't a cool news. And he had written [[01:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=5586.08s)]
*  some shit about me, but it was incorrect. That was the thing. Like somebody wrote something about me [[01:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=5591.84s)]
*  as their opinion. What the fuck hurts. But it's like, you can't do anything. But this dude had [[01:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=5595.36s)]
*  said something completely incorrect. So I wrote to him cause you click on their name and hit their [[01:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=5598.72s)]
*  email. So I wrote to the dude. I was like, Hey, I'm Kevin Smith. And you said this shit about me. [[01:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=5602.72s)]
*  I was like, I can't do anything about your opinion. But the one thing you said is factually [[01:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=5606.0s)]
*  untrue. So I just wanted to correct that. If you're going to go out and say things and stuff. Yeah. [[01:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=5610.16s)]
*  The dude wrote back, I don't know who you are, but I know you're one of the names that if some, [[01:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=5613.52s)]
*  if I throw out on any cool news, a bunch of people will jump to your defense. And that's how I like [[01:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=5617.04s)]
*  to hang out at night. And that blew my fucking mind. This was in the year 2000. I want to say [[01:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=5621.76s)]
*  maybe. Yeah. Cause it was before I did James Allen, Bob Shrek back, which has the whole ending of [[01:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=5627.76s)]
*  them going around beating up people on the fucking internet from a message. [[01:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=5631.84s)]
*  So I was there for, I'm not saying that was the first troll, but that was my one of my first [[01:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=5636.0s)]
*  trolls. And he said he liked doing it because he liked the, that's how he spent his night like that. [[01:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=5639.6s)]
*  And that's a, that's a legit fucking response that a human being sent me. That's not a made up story. [[01:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=5644.88s)]
*  That's not like I met a guy who said that happened. And I was so fucking flabbergasted by that. I'm not [[01:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=5648.72s)]
*  anymore because I understand that's cheap entertainment for some like fuck going to the movies or fuck going [[01:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=5654.88s)]
*  like going out to dinner. It's like fucking order some fucking pizza and let's just make, [[01:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=5660.32s)]
*  I'm just going to jump online and be like this guy's silly or whatever. And then watch people react [[01:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=5665.36s)]
*  and hit on that and shit. So I've watched the internet get way more toxic and shit like that. [[01:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=5669.12s)]
*  But at the same time, as much as the internet gives everybody access to you who can like fucking [[01:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=5673.759999999999s)]
*  shit on your day or try to shit in your mouth, it also gives you access to the most wonderful people [[01:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=5679.5199999999995s)]
*  in the world who say these amazing things about you that keep you going. And as previously spoken [[01:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=5684.24s)]
*  about, I never know how to feel about myself because I'm broken. So it helps. I'm obviously [[01:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=5688.719999999999s)]
*  part of the reason I do the job is because I like when people are like good job. Like my whole career [[01:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=5694.8s)]
*  has been about trying to produce work that's good enough for mom to put up on the fridge. [[01:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=5699.2s)]
*  Like when you get an A or B on the paper and she put that shit up on the fridge. The fridge is just [[01:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=5704.24s)]
*  the world at this point. And you hope that it's good enough that the paper goes up and gets noticed [[01:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=5708.64s)]
*  and shit. And you take a lot of slings and arrows even if you like to do a thing. So like there are [[01:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=5713.28s)]
*  the trolls who just go after you because like it's entertaining to watch other people blood in the [[01:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=5718.24s)]
*  water and shit like that. But then there are people who legitimately fucking hate you and what you do [[01:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=5722.4s)]
*  like and hate watch you. Just the way like Howard Stern used to have people who like [[01:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=5727.36s)]
*  if you like Howard Stern you listen for 10 minutes. If you hate Howard Stern you listen for [[01:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=5731.5199999999995s)]
*  fucking 20. So I get it. And I've been around on the internet long enough where I know like I am [[01:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=5734.96s)]
*  one of those figures and shit but it always baffles me. Like I put up a fucking post on [[01:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=5740.08s)]

*  She's got a good head on her shoulders and shit. She was the one that asked me to go vegan because [[01:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=5753.84s)]
*  she was vegan and after the heart attack she was like dad like please like just try it. It could [[01:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=5756.96s)]
*  help because the nutritionist in the hospital was like you might want to consider going plant-based [[01:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=5761.84s)]
*  because 100 blockage in your LAD that's really bad. So my kid was like can you please try it and I was [[01:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=5765.84s)]

*  honest with you. But I also know my kid is part me so she's very strategic. She as a vegan she was [[01:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=5775.84s)]
*  like if I could flip this motherfucker he'll be a big voice for the movement and shit like that. [[01:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=5781.52s)]

*  that if you don't have enough iron or whatever. I'm on blood thinners because of the heart attack. [[01:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=5800.0s)]
*  Does that help your wiener get harder? No in fact it's a little more challenging. [[01:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=5804.56s)]
*  Not challenging it's just the the hard on you get ain't it's workable it's fuckable dick. [[01:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=5808.88s)]

*  I can't do it. I'm the other guy where I'm like oh I could do it for three. Yeah. Whether we could [[01:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=6412.72s)]
*  do it for three or not. It's like we'll get there. We'll cram it into that fucking number. I wouldn't [[01:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=6416.88s)]
*  want to be anything fancy. Yeah and the privilege of like making a movie like everyone don't get to [[01:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=6420.56s)]
*  do that. It's a weird fucking proposition where you say to somebody like can you give me a lot [[01:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=6425.360000000001s)]
*  of money to make pretend? Most people are like just make pretend by themselves for free and shit [[01:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=6429.84s)]
*  and you're like I can't quite do it and I realize like my job is such it's full of shit man. It's a [[01:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=6434.96s)]
*  pack of lies. Basically what I try to do in life is capture artificially capture a moment that [[01:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=6441.04s)]
*  happened to me that made my head or heart feel something so overwhelmingly wonderful that I was [[01:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=6447.28s)]
*  like if I can fucking capture that and put it in a movie and show people how it felt I bet you [[01:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=6453.36s)]
*  other people would identify with that. So it was like the fourth movie. I mean I guess absolutely [[01:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=6456.64s)]
*  to some degree right. If that was your speed or whatever the fuck but like the idea of [[01:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=6463.76s)]
*  like I was on set and I guess it was because the 430 movie is the first movie. 430 is cool because [[01:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=6469.52s)]
*  it's like in the eighties or nineties eighties it takes place. Yeah dude it just had this [[01:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=6473.68s)]
*  like this free when you couldn't when your imagination where you if you wondered if a [[01:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=6478.400000000001s)]
*  girl cared about you all you could do is lay on your back in the in your fucking room floor [[01:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=6482.96s)]
*  listening to like um like Nirvana or something. Yeah together and just wondering and praying and [[01:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=6488.320000000001s)]
*  pining and just dry humping the carpet that this woman cared about you. Shy of dry humping the [[01:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=6496.16s)]
*  carpet um which I am against but that was never a part of my repertoire. Um you've nailed the [[01:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=6502.4s)]
*  feeling and me trying to capture that fucking feeling essentially that's what I do in movies. [[01:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=6508.8s)]
*  We weren't that rich. Oh my god were you rich? No we weren't but I heard about shag carpet and I [[01:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=6513.5199999999995s)]
*  thought that's what you were supposed to do. You heard about it. Did you have carpet period? Oh yeah [[01:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=6518.32s)]
*  we had wall to wall. You did? Like the cheap shit. Yeah not you know what yeah rugs are expensive [[01:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=6522.0s)]
*  carpeting is less expensive. You could pee on our carpet. Yeah and others did on our [[01:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=6527.36s)]
*  protest and sometimes not. Capturing the moment though being being a liar for a living and shit [[01:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=6533.52s)]
*  like that that is what making movies is is all about. That's why I like podcasting because it [[01:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=6537.92s)]
*  ain't a lie basically everything's true like you just sit down start talking having conversation. [[01:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=6542.64s)]
*  Yeah you try your best. Like one day someone will try maybe not this particular moment but [[01:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=6547.04s)]
*  and I've done it in movies you try to capture a podcast in a movie like in tusk we have them [[01:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=6553.04s)]
*  podcasting and stuff and once again that's an artificial snapshot of a moment that made me feel [[01:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=6558.08s)]
*  fucking absolute joy and then you give that moment to the movie and then the movie goes out to the [[01:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=6564.48s)]
*  audience and the moment stops being just yours and then for the rest of your life you interact [[01:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=6569.36s)]
*  with that movie periodically it comes up and you're watching it and you see this like wonderful [[01:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=6574.32s)]
*  this approximation this half-assed approximation of some amazing thing that had happened to you [[01:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=6579.679999999999s)]
*  and you go oh shit that's right like that was mine but then I shared it with the art form and [[01:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=6586.32s)]
*  stuff. When it comes to preparing for a movie what are some pitfalls that people can avoid? [[01:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=6590.96s)]
*  It might be little things it might just be energy being focused having enough time. Honestly the [[01:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=6599.2s)]
*  biggest pitfall I mean you'll never have enough time you'll never have enough money I don't give [[01:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=6603.6s)]
*  shit what your budget is like whether you have three million or three hundred every filmmaker [[01:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=6607.280000000001s)]
*  every producer always has the same complaint which is like not enough time not enough money [[01:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=6611.360000000001s)]
*  and even if you've got more money you think that'll ameliorate it it just winds up being the same [[01:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=6615.4400000000005s)]
*  fucking problem economy of scale so don't worry about that shit this is what you need to think [[01:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=6619.52s)]
*  about I think primarily. Be prepared in as much as like if you're starting for the first time you've [[01:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=6625.120000000001s)]
*  never done this shit before obviously this is an advice for people who do it for a living let's [[01:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=6632.8s)]
*  say you're a first timer rehearse the fuck out of that shit like a month on clerks mall rats chasing [[01:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=6637.28s)]
*  Amy rehearse for a month before we went near a set that way your take ratio is going to be real low [[01:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=6642.56s)]
*  now some people be like what does that matter in the age of fucking digital video back when you're [[01:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=6647.6s)]
*  shooting film yes it was expensive to process film time is money on a movie fucking set so if you can [[01:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=6651.360000000001s)]
*  accomplish it in one take fucking move on like the story of my life and I've told it before publicly [[01:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=6656.64s)]
*  so this might not be news to some but how I've been able to keep doing what I've been doing for [[01:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=6662.32s)]
*  30 years of people like I hate him why does he keep fucking how can he still work this is why [[01:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=6666.799999999999s)]
*  I don't strive for excellence I ain't Chris fucking Nolan believe me every critic will tell you that [[01:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=6671.759999999999s)]
*  shit Chris Nolan strives for excellence I from the beginning of my career from clerks forward was [[01:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=6675.92s)]
*  never like let's make it fucking perfect if I was striving for perfection I don't think I've ever [[01:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=6680.5599999999995s)]
*  made my first film yet I'd still be sitting there frozen what will it be like ah good enough will [[01:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=6685.12s)]
*  take you very far good enough has taken me 30 years so on the set of clerks we'd be shooting I'd [[01:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=6690.0s)]
*  be like cut um all right that's good enough let's move on let's do something else good enough has [[01:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=6694.4s)]
*  gotten me here has gotten me all the way to this fucking chair good enough we'll get you as far as [[01:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=6700.0s)]
*  you need to go now you know that's probably not winner talk right like fucking if you want to win [[01:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=6704.08s)]
*  an Oscar you got to leave it on the table you got to fucking like make people hurt fucking make those [[01:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=6709.28s)]
*  movies where like Leonardo's fighting a fucking bear and shit and fucking make people sit in the [[01:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=6713.6s)]
*  snow to do it because everyone's got to be miserable in order for this to read and shit like [[01:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=6718.0s)]
*  that I ain't that guy and that committed to it I just like to make pretend maybe get a little money [[01:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=6721.52s)]
*  for it and shit so I can't go in authentically like that where it's like oh fucking everything [[01:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=6725.76s)]
*  it's going to be perfection at the cost of everybody and there are directors who do that [[01:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=6733.92s)]
*  and I respect them I guess a little bit I wouldn't do that to my cast and crew but like those movies [[01:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=6738.24s)]
*  are fucking successful because they've got a vision and a drive and the passion of a filmmaker [[01:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=6742.72s)]
*  if I were ever trying to make one of those things it wouldn't happen number one I have the talent [[01:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=6747.04s)]
*  number two I don't have that kind of patience and shit number three I can't do that to other people [[01:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=6752.64s)]
*  I want people leaving my set going I had a good ass fucking time that's how I keep my budgets low [[01:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=6756.72s)]
*  crew comes back and they'll work for fucking scale because like look you don't pay a lot but fucking [[01:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=6761.6s)]
*  it's a good time on a set you're going to enjoy yourself you're going to have fucking happy memories [[01:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=6765.84s)]
*  and shit like that good enough gets me to the set you know if I've rehearsed enough before we shoot [[01:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=6769.36s)]
*  and I'm on set one two take stops and I'm like good enough moving on and that time all adds up [[01:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=6775.2s)]
*  that's fucking money so strive for perfection I guess at some point in your career I honestly [[01:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=6781.12s)]
*  never have and I've just been doing it for 30 years and some people out there I'm sure the [[01:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=6786.88s)]
*  letterbox crowd would be disgusted by that thought like oh he doesn't even fucking try clearly I try [[01:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=6790.639999999999s)]
*  I've been doing this for 30 fucking years well you show I don't try and beyond show up I deliver [[01:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=6795.28s)]
*  I just don't fucking make everyone's life miserable to fucking deliver something that's like I've got [[01:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=6800.0s)]
*  a vision right I got an idea where we're going and shit let's all have a good time doing it [[01:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=6805.04s)]
*  otherwise what was the fucking point if people on a set are miserable when you make pretend for a [[01:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=6809.2s)]
*  living everybody is fucking failed and you shouldn't be doing this like it should be fun [[01:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=6813.84s)]
*  it's making pretend for a living and I understand you know there are some people like no man art is [[01:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=6819.04s)]
*  pain and it's good not really this is this is an art form don't get me wrong but like doesn't have [[01:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=6823.2s)]
*  to be fucking painful it's very cathartic and a lot of folks can't do that fucking pivot like it's [[01:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=6828.48s)]
*  got to be this and I don't believe in that so I'm the guy that's just like that's good enough [[01:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=6834.48s)]
*  it's moving on every one of my movies is good enough don't have to be great and shit I saw [[01:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=6839.839999999999s)]
*  somebody the other day on twitter was like it's got like one or two really brilliant ideas in his [[01:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=6843.759999999999s)]
*  movie and the rest is just some fucking horse shit and I'm like yeah I mean that's it you don't have [[01:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=6848.5599999999995s)]
*  to keep watching if you don't like that kind of thing but I'm lucky I got one or two good ideas [[01:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=6852.24s)]
*  in the horse shit like especially 30 years into my career oh it's fascinating man because if you're [[01:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=6856.32s)]
*  always aiming for perfection then but a lot of times if you're showing up and delivering [[01:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=6860.72s)]
*  and good enough because most people don't even go that far the fear of the lack of not being [[01:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=6867.6s)]
*  prepared for perfection prevents them sometimes from taking the step where it's the fear of not [[01:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=6872.400000000001s)]
*  being able to achieve perfection I just accept early on it's like never gonna be fucking perfect [[01:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=6877.12s)]
*  and you're never the dictator of this anyway and I don't mean the dictator like a guy or an autocrat [[01:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=6881.52s)]
*  you don't get to dictate whether or not that thing is what it is that you say it is you make [[01:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=6886.16s)]
*  a thing with one intention the audience is going to tell you what that fucking thing is what it [[01:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=6891.28s)]
*  means and shit like that this is a story I tell an awful lot so if you've heard this in another [[01:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=6895.44s)]
*  place I apologize but when I was making the 430 movie and this ain't to bring it back to that [[01:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=6900.0s)]
*  like it's relevant to this conversation we're I'm shooting to see the three boys they're in the car [[01:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=6905.76s)]
*  and they're just like fucking goofing off while they're driving dancing while they drive playing [[01:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=6910.08s)]
*  chakras I feel for you so they were you know for direction I went over to the vehicle and I was [[01:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=6913.84s)]
*  like kids you know you're just goofing around and dance whatever the fuck do whatever you want [[01:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=6919.68s)]
*  just as long as you make it iconic and I walked away and that fucked all of their heads up I had [[01:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=6926.24s)]
*  no idea like Nick who plays Bernie in the movie was like that's your fucking direction make it [[01:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=6931.4400000000005s)]
*  iconic that's a little fucking pressure don't you think and I was like well no I said oh then I [[01:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=6938.24s)]
*  realized I have the benefit of experience I've been doing this for 30 years I was like what I [[01:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=6943.28s)]
*  mean by that is that every decision that you're making here in real time is like dropping a stone [[01:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=6946.8s)]
*  in the water and watching the ripple effect or the butterfly effect like it's crazy what people [[01:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=6953.36s)]
*  years from now will concentrate on about this weird little moment in the movie that you're just like [[01:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=6960.4s)]
*  what should we do and I'm like oh just make it iconic I mean that because people will be watching [[01:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=6966.8s)]
*  this scene forever and it will hopefully connect with them even if it's somebody who wasn't alive [[01:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=6971.68s)]
*  in 1986 a current day teenager who could see that fucking sense that joy that's in the scene [[01:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=6976.72s)]
*  so these things we do in the moment like this fair bit passes and it's just a fucking Kevin [[01:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=6982.96s)]
*  Smith movie but I promise you this movie is somebody's gonna be somebody's fucking life [[01:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=6987.6s)]
*  preserver there's gonna be their buoy that's gonna keep them fucking drowning and I know that [[01:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=6992.0s)]
*  because I've been doing it 30 years and I was at the Dallas fan expo like last year and a guy came [[01:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=6995.84s)]

*  between me going crazy and not or I saw your stand-up special it made me fucking laugh and [[01:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=7040.4s)]
*  that fucking I needed that on that day because I was circling the fucking drain so in this business [[01:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=7044.4s)]
*  we have experience with people that perhaps overly express it by saying something like oh my god [[01:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=7049.679999999999s)]
*  fucking your shit saved my life and stuff so I've heard that sentiment and I know how to receive it [[01:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=7055.44s)]
*  and I'm like oh my god thank you that's so kind and he goes no I'm serious he's going my father [[01:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=7059.599999999999s)]
*  used to beat the shit out of me every day after school I'd come home and he would mercilessly [[01:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=7064.48s)]
*  relentlessly beat me to the point of fucking near dying wow he's like and then I would crawl to my [[01:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=7068.96s)]
*  bedroom bloody mess and I would close the bedroom door and I put in mall rats and I escaped to the [[01:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=7074.08s)]
*  mall with ts and brody and jay and silent bomb and he's gone and that was my happy place and [[01:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=7079.2s)]
*  that's how I survived living with my father through this fucking tape he goes now I have a son [[01:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=7084.56s)]
*  and he's gone and I would never be the piece of shit that my fucking father was to me my whole [[01:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=7091.120000000001s)]
*  life and I want to give my kid this tape when he's old enough so he understands he could survive [[01:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=7095.68s)]
*  anything because his father survived the absolute worst and this was what he clung clung to wow [[01:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=7099.92s)]
*  and naturally I gave him a big hug and I was like no did you survive that shit like fucking this is [[01:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=7105.120000000001s)]
*  just a movie that might have helped but like when you share of yourself like that you can go off [[01:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=7108.96s)]
*  and make and you know it don't matter what it is when it comes to movies they have this weird [[01:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=7114.32s)]
*  impact it doesn't matter what we do when it comes to this show when it comes to your live shows [[01:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=7119.04s)]
*  but particularly when you make something like a movie people cherish that kind of thing because [[01:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=7122.64s)]
*  you're in and out there's an engagement period 90 minutes to two hours is going to take you on a [[01:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=7127.04s)]
*  ride and then bring you back and leave you where you were so everyone knows what to expect in that [[01:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=7131.36s)]
*  and over the course of their lifetime they've turned to movies in times of trial oh yeah I [[01:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=7136.72s)]
*  watch Family Man every year to feel good so you create that and you become that for somebody else [[01:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=7142.0s)]
*  so movie you're talking about making with spade I guarantee you one day somebody comes up to you [[01:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=7148.400000000001s)]
*  and tells you a story as fucking heartbreaking yet as wonderful as that which is like something you [[01:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=7152.88s)]
*  didn't even give that much thought to like if my man came up he was like dog must save my life I'd [[01:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=7157.6s)]
*  be like I understand it man like fucking I worked hard on that and that movie's pretty fucking [[01:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=7161.4400000000005s)]
*  profound on some levels and shit yes it has a lot of butt fucking jokes but I like to balance it out [[01:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=7165.84s)]
*  but when somebody tells you like mall rats save their life you're like I wasn't thinking of that [[01:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=7170.4800000000005s)]
*  when I made a movie do you think 25 year old Kevin Smith was going uh this is going to save [[01:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=7174.4800000000005s)]
*  somebody's life hold on Jay uh get ready to fucking swing me across the fucking mall and you know [[01:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=7179.28s)]
*  you don't think about that so when I told the kids make it iconic that's what it comes down to even [[01:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=7185.04s)]
*  the things you're not thinking about that as being important you think are dismissive or just oh it's [[01:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=7189.6s)]
*  just a moment in the movie someone will find that as the buoy that keeps them from fucking drowning [[01:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=7194.64s)]
*  so every moment then is kind of important but isn't that the lesson of life in general every [[02:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=7200.400000000001s)]
*  moment is kind of important and like you know when I was in the nuthouse they say all sorts of [[02:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=7204.400000000001s)]
*  simplistic shit which is fucking really helpful you can put it on a towel and stuff in a kitchen [[02:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=7208.88s)]
*  aphorism or whatever fuck and what they say every day is a gift that's why it's called the present [[02:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=7214.0s)]
*  and it's kind of true like it's absolutely true like so often we're so fucking bored as a species [[02:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=7219.360000000001s)]
*  that we don't think about like you're only going to get so many breaths you're only going to get [[02:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=7224.16s)]
*  so many heartbeats and shit like that and I always tell my wife after the heart attack I was like uh [[02:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=7227.92s)]
*  I'm living on borrowed time and she's like well that's fucking macabre and I was like no [[02:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=7232.8s)]
*  that's I'm painfully aware we're all living on borrowed time I'm just fucking well aware of it [[02:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=7236.32s)]
*  act accordingly do you think like as a creator do you ever want to invent something do you ever also [[02:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=7241.599999999999s)]
*  think about inventing something but you didn't do it because a lot of times people who are creative [[02:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=7246.4s)]
*  think about things like this is there ever been not an invention like fucking phlobe or something [[02:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=7250.4s)]
*  right but anyone that kind of stood out in your head or something because I thought like I've been [[02:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=7254.879999999999s)]
*  trying to make this movie moose jaws for 10 years one day I'm gonna get it's gonna happen I'm gonna [[02:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=7257.759999999999s)]
*  find the money for it and eventually I'm gonna get to the place where I'm like you know what I'll [[02:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=7261.839999999999s)]
*  just put up my house I ain't got theovon money and shit but I got a nice house where I could probably [[02:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=7265.759999999999s)]
*  you can live in that celsius cooler if you want to I will I'll sell my house live there I'm like honey [[02:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=7270.0s)]
*  get ready because who like I always feel like who invented the swimming pool wherever like I always [[02:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=7274.4s)]
*  think about who invented certain stuff you know or like and then I think if I would want to have an [[02:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=7277.84s)]
*  invention like I thought of um oh I used to think there was a dog collar or whatever that if because [[02:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=7281.6s)]
*  they had a lot of howling dogs by us when I was a kid and so if it howled it would help the dog learn [[02:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=7287.6s)]
*  how to howl um more melodically or whatever like a um musically you know so so eventually the howl [[02:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=7292.72s)]
*  it's not just like oh yeah it's like oh there's somebody to howl with because they always harmonize [[02:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=7302.4800000000005s)]
*  when there's more than one right so it's almost like a dog it's almost like having a pocket pal [[02:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=7307.52s)]
*  like bell biv dog bow or dog bow or something like a mezzo spaniel whatever first draft for a name [[02:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=7311.68s)]
*  but I like where you're going yeah okay yeah but wouldn't it be beautiful if you're laying there [[02:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=7317.280000000001s)]
*  and one of them howls you like these motherfuckers but then they're like [[02:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=7320.96s)]
*  totally they're all fucking singing in unison and shit so I thought if you could do a group collar [[02:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=7324.72s)]
*  like for a neighborhood or small region I thought that that would be pretty cool and then you and [[02:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=7329.040000000001s)]
*  then fucking then the next nirvana three neighborhood dogs that just got together [[02:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=7333.12s)]
*  and have these harmonizing collars and people like he's singing exactly how I fucking feel [[02:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=7338.16s)]
*  I don't know what he's saying but that's how I feel that's the beautiful thing about art you [[02:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=7342.8s)]
*  don't even have to know the lyrics to a song by dog nirvana you just feel it when you play it [[02:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=7346.16s)]
*  that's why if I was a if I wish I was in a different art form if I was a singer [[02:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=7350.4s)]
*  I could open up my mouth sing a note and you'd know how I felt that'd be me my self-expression [[02:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=7354.64s)]

*  to exist and the two least healthy places for a human being to be the past and the future the [[02:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=8595.519999999999s)]
*  condition of the human being is such that we spend so much of our time thinking about what we've done [[02:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=8604.4s)]
*  and what went wrong and what could have and should have happened and our regret and we [[02:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=8609.04s)]
*  relitigate the past like we're expert fucking lawyers and barristers and shit like that [[02:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=8613.6s)]
*  and so we're not here in the moment we're in the past going like oh remember i said that shit and [[02:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=8618.960000000001s)]
*  why didn't that person say hi that time and fucking man how come that dude's doing it i'm not why are [[02:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=8623.04s)]

*  change it thank then end game happens but you cannot fucking change the past so stay out of [[02:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=8635.68s)]
*  the fucking past because the past is depression future is anxiety nobody controls that shit [[02:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=8640.08s)]
*  nobody knows what's going to happen and you can't sit there we we're you know a lot of people you [[02:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=8645.84s)]

*  this audience is way more creative than me as fine a writer than me if not better when it comes to [[02:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=8653.36s)]
*  imagining a dire future for themselves we are all the most creative and invented fucking individuals [[02:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=8658.56s)]
*  when we're thinking about all the shit that could go wrong we build scenarios crazy scenarios about [[02:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=8663.68s)]
*  this happens and this and this and this and we live in them they're so fucking real the body [[02:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=8669.52s)]
*  remembers there's a book called the body remembers which is about trauma and how the body stores [[02:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=8674.0s)]
*  trauma scientifically proven body remembers trauma so then later on in life when you think [[02:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=8677.92s)]
*  about the trauma guess what the body remembers it and it revisits it through the amygdala and [[02:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=8683.6s)]
*  shit like that so when you've got ptsd that's why people get shakes or fucking have to be away from [[02:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=8687.84s)]
*  people and stuff that's real the physically the body remembers fucking trauma and stuff like that [[02:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=8692.64s)]
*  so the best way past all that shit i don't know i'm still trying to figure that out but stay out of [[02:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=8698.24s)]
*  the past god damn it and stay out of the future because you can't do anything about it all that [[02:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=8704.96s)]
*  fucking like think about this all that like oh my god this is going to happen and this happens and [[02:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=8710.08s)]
*  everything fucking goes wrong and i lose again and shit oh yeah it's a nightmare you it's not true [[02:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=8714.56s)]
*  though it's all fiction that you're just making up you're going to make some future shit up because [[02:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=8718.8s)]
*  that's what it is you don't know what's going to happen flip the script and just fucking make up all [[02:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=8721.92s)]
*  happy fucking goofy ass unbelievable shit for yourself dude it has as much likelihood as [[02:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=8725.84s)]
*  fucking happening that's the truth it ain't even fucking fantasy it's like you're already not you [[02:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=8732.0s)]
*  but the collective view you're already living in fantasy if you're like no only bad shit happens [[02:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=8736.88s)]
*  you're already fucking weaving a fantastic fucking tale that is untrue and it's based on no facts [[02:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=8741.2s)]
*  whatsoever so if you can do that just fucking change it to like you know what marvel calls [[02:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=8746.24s)]
*  me all of a sudden i'm directing the next fucking avengers movie yeah it has just as much a chance [[02:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=8750.8s)]
*  of happening as the negative bullshit so if we can't live in the past or shouldn't live in the [[02:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeXiIt55Mw&t=8755.599999999999s)]
