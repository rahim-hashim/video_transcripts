# Wayne Gretzky  This Past Weekend w Theo Von #471
**Theo Von - This Past Weekend:** [November 21, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4)
*  Today's guest is a legend in the sport of hockey and, um, and a legend just in, in humanity, in human history. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=0.0s)]
*  It's a name that's synonymous, uh, with being victorious. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=9.08s)]
*  He's a four time Stanley cup winner. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=13.72s)]
*  He has more records than, um, than sun studios. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=15.5s)]
*  This guy has more records in hockey than anyone. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=19.64s)]
*  You can catch him on the TNT NHL panel. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=22.32s)]
*  Uh, I'm so thankful to spend time with him today, Mr. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=27.16s)]
*  Wayne Gretzky. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=31.36s)]
*  Yeah, I'm from Louisiana, man. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=56.48s)]
*  It's pretty good. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=57.48s)]
*  We didn't ever had, we had a team. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=58.4s)]
*  I think it was the algae or something. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=61.64s)]
*  I don't know what our, it was the East coast league probably. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=63.31999999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=66.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=67.08s)]
*  It was like, or the mud birds or something, some team. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=67.39999999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=70.39999999999999s)]
*  It was definitely like even the mascot sounded like it wasn't going to survive. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=71.03999999999999s)]
*  You know, it was like, I think it was the, um, that's funny. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=75.64s)]
*  I think it was the, um, it was the, um, it was the, um, it was the, um, it was the, um, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=80.24s)]
*  mascot got traded. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=87.32000000000001s)]
*  I think it was the oil spill pigeons or something. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=89.36s)]
*  Like, cause there was, we had a lot of issues. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=92.32000000000001s)]
*  That was very funny. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=96.72s)]
*  So I think our mascot was, uh, yeah, it was bad. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=97.92s)]
*  The mascot always had bandages on and stuff. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=101.28s)]
*  I remember they bring, it was just, it didn't do well. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=103.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=106.52000000000001s)]
*  Timing probably wasn't great. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=107.60000000000001s)]
*  It's kind of grown now. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=109.92s)]
*  Like there's a team here in Atlanta that does pretty well. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=112.0s)]
*  Like it's like comparable to AA in baseball. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=115.11999999999999s)]
*  It's not AAA and they do pretty good here. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=119.8s)]
*  They're, and they're talking about bringing another NHL team to Atlanta. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=123.19999999999999s)]
*  No way. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=128.04s)]
*  Be the third time in 40 years, but. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=128.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=131.35999999999999s)]
*  They tried it twice. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=131.56s)]
*  I know over the, over the, over the history of time. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=132.44s)]
*  And do you know like, yeah, why doesn't it succeed? [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=135.32s)]
*  You think in certain markets, is it just not the, is it, well, does it just take [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=137.72s)]
*  people to be there or does it take something special to be in a market [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=142.88s)]
*  for hockey to survive? [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=146.51999999999998s)]
*  It's a little bit of both because we don't have, you know, we don't have, um, [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=148.24s)]
*  like baseball and football. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=153.64s)]
*  It's been in the South and the Southwest forever, right? [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=155.56s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=158.96s)]
*  Hockey is just kind of getting there. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=159.32s)]
*  So back in the seventies, when the flames first came in, the [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=161.32s)]
*  expansion rules were different. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=164.6s)]
*  The owners wanted the money, the league wanted the money, but they gave you [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=166.48s)]
*  the worst teams, so they would go five, six, seven years. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=169.56s)]
*  And go, well, it's not a hockey city. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=172.88s)]
*  Well, people get tired of paying to watch a team lose. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=175.12s)]
*  Right? [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=178.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=179.04s)]
*  So then they came back again. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=179.44s)]
*  It was kind of the same expansion rules and it failed again. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=180.64s)]
*  The, everyone who got wiser and when Vegas came in, they got the [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=184.84s)]
*  ninth best player on every team. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=189.07999999999998s)]
*  They got low draft picks and they built a foundation and people got excited. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=191.28s)]
*  Look, our team's good. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=195.12s)]
*  Seattle got the same sort of thing as Atlanta or as Vegas. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=196.6s)]
*  If Atlanta gets another team, they're going to get that advantage again. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=201.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=205.64s)]
*  They're going to get good treatment and maybe this will become a good hockey [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=205.92s)]
*  city because people are saying, Jesus, we're winning and let's go to the games. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=209.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=212.64s)]
*  So it's not fair to people of Atlanta. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=212.95999999999998s)]
*  Their teams were so bad. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=216.28s)]
*  You just say, I'm not paying anymore. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=217.39999999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=219.76s)]
*  At a certain point you can't, yeah, you can't go and be really [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=220.0s)]
*  supporting some of the teams. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=223.04s)]
*  I think in the South, well, the South is also kind of religious. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=224.72s)]
*  There's more religion there, you know, and the only person we've [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=227.51999999999998s)]
*  ever seen even kind of, or the only person that people believe like behaves [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=230.4s)]
*  like, or gets wild on water is Jesus really. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=234.6s)]
*  So I think the second you see a guy saying, Hey, look what I'm going to [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=237.84s)]
*  do out here on this frozen Lake. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=240.44s)]
*  I think it makes you wonder what's going on here. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=242.48000000000002s)]
*  Well, in Canada, we call our arenas churches. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=246.8s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=249.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=250.32s)]
*  Because, you know, Canada, it's hockey and religion. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=250.44s)]
*  Those are the two biggest things, right? [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=253.88s)]
*  So you can be, you know, sports is very popular in our country. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=255.76s)]
*  Football, Canadian football, baseball, the blue Jays do well. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=260.03999999999996s)]
*  The Raptors have done really well. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=263.56s)]
*  So it's kind of Canada's team, the Raptors and the blue Jays. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=265.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=268.52s)]
*  But hockey is everywhere, right? [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=269.28s)]
*  So you can be driving in your car in July and if you're listening to talk radio, [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=271.24s)]
*  it's still 90% hockey that they're talking about June, July and August. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=276.56s)]
*  Cause you can still do it. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=280.92s)]
*  And it's so popular, right? [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=282.4s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=283.96s)]
*  People love it. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=284.52s)]
*  People, I think it's unbelievable. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=285.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=287.4s)]
*  It's, you know, like down, down in the U S I was encouraged parents to tell [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=287.64s)]
*  their kids play every sport, tennis, baseball, football, basketball, soccer, [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=292.2s)]
*  uh, field lacrosse, and they're all so big. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=297.8s)]
*  And if you sat down here, you would say, okay, baseball is probably [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=301.0s)]
*  the most popular sport or no, it's basketball is the biggest sport. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=304.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=307.8s)]
*  And then you're like, well, football is pretty big, but in Canada, [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=308.15999999999997s)]
*  there's no definition. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=311.36s)]
*  It's one. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=312.36s)]
*  It's one. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=312.96s)]
*  It's ice hockey. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=313.36s)]
*  It's hockey. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=313.91999999999996s)]
*  That's it. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=314.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=315.03999999999996s)]
*  I think I'm trying to think a while. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=315.28s)]
*  We never, uh, yeah, I think, yeah, if everything's frozen, you, you know. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=316.67999999999995s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=323.4s)]
*  Well, we got a big advantage because you got free ice. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=323.67999999999995s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=326.71999999999997s)]
*  You got free ice, right? [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=326.88s)]
*  You know, it's a big thing. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=328.03999999999996s)]
*  You know, I think $18 a bag one problem. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=329.11999999999995s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=331.79999999999995s)]
*  It's, it's ice is expensive and you know, parents, a lot of parents, it's hard [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=332.08s)]
*  for them to afford hockey equipment, ice skates, uh, paying for ice time. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=337.55999999999995s)]
*  But in Canada, most of the places you can play, I grew up in Southern [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=342.56s)]
*  Ontario, which is, uh, basically between Niagara Falls, New York and Detroit. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=347.36s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=355.56s)]
*  That's, I mean, that's the third shelf of the freezer section, buddy. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=356.04s)]
*  That's pretty, it gets pretty chilly. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=358.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=359.76s)]
*  So we had an ice rink in my backyard from the time I was, yeah, I saw some lore [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=360.08s)]
*  about that. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=364.48s)]
*  So my dad would go and he would buy a sprinkler head in December, which they [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=365.48s)]
*  always thought he was crazy. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=371.56s)]
*  Who's buying a sprinkler head? [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=374.24s)]
*  Christmas time anyway. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=375.96s)]
*  And he would put it out in the middle of the ice and he would let it go back and [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=377.52s)]
*  forth for like two hours and then go move it. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=380.2s)]
*  Another part of the ice and his ice was always about this thick and it would last [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=382.68s)]
*  till probably the end of March. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=387.68s)]
*  Did he lay a good rank? [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=390.08s)]
*  Oh, he had the best. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=391.36s)]
*  Really? [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=392.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=392.48s)]
*  And he was funny. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=392.76s)]
*  People used to stop by the house and say, how does Walter get his grass so green? [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=394.44s)]
*  What do you do? [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=399.08s)]
*  What are you putting in your grass? [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=399.6s)]
*  My dad didn't do anything. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=401.2s)]
*  It was just probably from the ice being so good for the grass. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=402.8s)]
*  He always had the greenest grass in the neighborhood and didn't do anything. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=407.16s)]
*  That's pretty classy, man. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=413.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=414.8s)]
*  We had some uneven areas. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=415.0s)]
*  I remember I played baseball. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=416.44s)]
*  I mean, I didn't, I don't know if I was, you know, mom signed me up a couple [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=418.24s)]
*  seasons, man, and it wasn't great for me, but our field was uneven. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=421.40000000000003s)]
*  We had an uneven field. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=427.08000000000004s)]
*  So every ball, if you hit anything second base, it was all in it up in right field. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=428.56s)]
*  Right? [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=432.56s)]
*  We probably had 25% gradient on the field. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=432.8s)]
*  So we had at least two right fielders always, at least. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=436.12s)]
*  That's probably, now listen, I grew up loving baseball. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=439.68s)]
*  I went and saw my grandson play the other day. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=443.0s)]
*  He had his hat on backwards. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=444.84000000000003s)]
*  I think he was picking Danny lines. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=446.48s)]
*  Always. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=448.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=448.52s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=449.52s)]
*  It's always that kid out there who ends up doing being a gardener or something. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=449.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=452.48s)]
*  And then I took him to, we went to watch him play ice hockey the next day and [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=452.84000000000003s)]
*  they're out there sweating and skating for an hour loving it. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=457.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=459.6s)]
*  And they got to figure out a way to get these kids more enthusiastic about [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=460.04s)]
*  baseball because it's not a lot of fun for some of them who are standing [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=463.52s)]
*  out in the outfield. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=466.84000000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=468.0s)]
*  I think, and I think that's one of the reasons, mate, I don't know if [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=468.16s)]
*  baseball is, I guess it's always America's sport because there's [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=470.2s)]
*  something rooted in tradition about it. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=474.4s)]
*  There's something, I mean, you give an American a hot dog, they'll sit there [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=476.52s)]
*  and do anything for a little while, you know, but I think it's true. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=479.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=484.48s)]
*  It's, and I, you know, I do it. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=484.8s)]
*  If somebody's like. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=486.2s)]
*  And the history of the game, you know, the history of baseball from [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=487.15999999999997s)]
*  Babe Ruth, what he did to what Jackie Robinson did for everyone. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=490.2s)]
*  There's so much history and let's face it, it's economically easier to [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=494.36s)]
*  buy a pair of shoes and a baseball glove than to have to buy a whole [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=499.36s)]
*  entire hockey equipment sort of. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=503.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=506.76s)]
*  To set that up in certain parts, right? [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=506.96s)]
*  And then in other parts, it's the other way around, you know, like it would be [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=508.96s)]
*  tougher to like heat a basketball court in the winter in Canada so that [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=511.84s)]
*  people have the opportunity to be there and play as much. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=516.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=518.88s)]
*  We don't, you know, although the Raptors have really found a [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=519.12s)]
*  niche in our country. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=522.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=524.0s)]
*  Like they're huge. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=524.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=525.2800000000001s)]
*  People love them. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=525.4000000000001s)]
*  I was in your country when they won the championship. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=525.9200000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=527.88s)]
*  And I was in Vancouver, but people were like beating each other and [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=528.36s)]
*  hugging each other at the same time. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=531.76s)]
*  So like in our country, like you're in Vancouver, you're Canucks fan and [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=533.0400000000001s)]
*  you're in Alberta, you either flames oilers and all the way across, right? [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=538.0s)]
*  But if you're in Vancouver or Newfoundland, you're a Blue Jays fan or a Raptors fan. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=541.84s)]
*  It's just, it's Canada's team and they just all cling to it. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=546.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=549.24s)]
*  It's something pretty special about it. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=549.5200000000001s)]
*  And I always see when guys get traded up there, more basketball than baseball. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=551.0400000000001s)]
*  And the guys say, well, I don't want to play in Canada. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=555.12s)]
*  I want to stay in my own country. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=556.76s)]
*  But the guys who go there will tell you, they get treated phenomenally. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=558.1600000000001s)]
*  It's a great city to live in. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=561.6s)]
*  It's a great country and people are nice. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=562.9200000000001s)]
*  Okay. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=565.32s)]
*  People's always so nice in Canada. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=565.72s)]
*  Even if somebody was angry, they may, I bet they would, they'd come across the [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=568.12s)]
*  street and they'd just say, Hey, I'm angry, but I'm sorry. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=571.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=574.8000000000001s)]
*  You know, there's a lot of stories up there. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=575.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=576.72s)]
*  They're just too kind. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=577.2s)]
*  Well, I noticed even like, you know, I grew up in the South. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=578.24s)]
*  There's a lot of like, I don't know if there's still as much, but especially [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=580.76s)]
*  when I was growing up, there was like more racial disparity down there, you [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=583.8000000000001s)]
*  know, cause there's a lot of history of like black and white racism down there. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=586.5200000000001s)]
*  And, um, and when I was in Canada, I don't feel that energy. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=589.6s)]
*  I don't, everybody seems the same. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=593.5200000000001s)]
*  It's like, I often say that to people that we just, we don't seem to have [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=595.84s)]
*  racism in our country, people all seem to get along, you know? [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=600.88s)]
*  And it's that's why people always come up to me and they say, you're from Canada, [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=604.16s)]
*  right? [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=608.88s)]
*  And I say, yeah, like Canadians are all so nice. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=609.16s)]
*  And I go, yeah, I think they are. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=613.52s)]
*  And I said, but you know, I got five American kids, five American [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=615.4s)]
*  grandchildren and they're all nice kids too. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=619.36s)]
*  So you can meet a lot of nice people in the United States. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=621.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=624.04s)]
*  Well, I think if you're coming out of that Gretzky lineage, I think you [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=624.8399999999999s)]

*  They had a good mother. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=633.0400000000001s)]
*  So, you know, listen, when you're, when you're working and playing hockey, you [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=633.8000000000001s)]
*  know, it's hard, you know, the schedule is tough. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=639.0400000000001s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=641.6s)]
*  You can't be like, playing on the West coast in LA and Edmonton. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=641.96s)]
*  We're always either playing or in an airplane. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=645.0400000000001s)]
*  Right? [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=647.2800000000001s)]
*  So listen, uh, I love my kids dearly, but it was the mother who was around them. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=648.08s)]
*  The mothers are so, so vital. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=653.76s)]
*  It was like my, my relationship with my mom and dad was very close. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=655.36s)]
*  My dad was sort of this hockey father of the country, you know, people loved my dad. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=659.16s)]
*  Walter Gretzky, man. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=664.4s)]
*  But I would always say, but it was my mom behind the scenes and kept her family. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=665.4399999999999s)]
*  She was a wonderful lady and she always kind of stayed out of the limelight. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=670.56s)]
*  Like when I was a kid and I play, all the parents used to sit sort of together [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=674.16s)]
*  and my mom would sit in the corner by herself. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=678.04s)]
*  So what did she like to do? [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=681.4s)]
*  Your mom, like, what were some, like, when she had time for herself, what [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=682.96s)]
*  were some hobbies that she liked? [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=685.3199999999999s)]
*  Cause I, I mean, from what I hear, from what it sounds like your dad, probably [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=686.4399999999999s)]
*  you've got pretty involved with you once you started playing hockey as much. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=689.8s)]
*  So a lot of people don't know this, but I had a, um, down syndrome aunt and she [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=692.76s)]
*  was born in the fifties and back in those days they would take these kids and [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=700.9599999999999s)]
*  basically they put them in asylums and medicate them and people didn't know what to do. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=705.36s)]
*  So my grandmother said, you know, I'm not sending her to school. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=711.76s)]
*  So she never went to school a day in her life. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=715.6s)]
*  Um, she was by the end, she was a little bit blind. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=718.28s)]
*  She lived till she was 63 and my grandfather was from, uh, Russia, Belarus, [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=720.8000000000001s)]
*  Minsk, Russia, my grandmother was from, uh, Ukraine and the kids were born in [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=726.36s)]
*  Canada and my grandfather would speak to her in Russian, my grandmother would [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=731.8000000000001s)]
*  speak to her in Ukrainian and we all communicated with her in English. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=736.8000000000001s)]
*  Oh, and that'll give anybody down syndrome. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=740.1600000000001s)]
*  And my dad used to always say, if you don't believe in the good Lord, [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=743.04s)]
*  there's a great example right here. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=745.8399999999999s)]
*  But so when she was trilingual then she could understand, but she spoke only [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=747.2399999999999s)]
*  English and if you didn't know her, you'd have a hard time understanding her, [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=751.88s)]
*  but we grew up with her. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=755.5999999999999s)]
*  So we were fine. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=756.52s)]
*  So when my grandmother was passing, she said, do me one favor, don't put her in [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=757.68s)]
*  her home and of course my mother said, I'll take care of her. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=762.88s)]
*  So she lived with my parents for at least 12 years, I guess. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=765.68s)]
*  And then, um, uh, wow. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=769.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=772.36s)]
*  And then you were a child too. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=772.68s)]
*  It was when you were a kid. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=773.92s)]
*  No, she, so my grandmother would have passed in 88. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=775.1999999999999s)]
*  Um, and that's when she moved in with my mom and dad. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=779.4399999999999s)]
*  So she had her hands full with her own kids, grandkids, my, uh, my aunt. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=782.92s)]
*  Um, if she, her enjoyment really was, uh, Friday nights going with her, [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=789.28s)]
*  her mom was my grandmother. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=794.72s)]
*  They go, they love bingo. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=796.12s)]
*  That was a big thing in our hometown. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=797.6800000000001s)]
*  And she could, my dad said she could play bingo every night. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=799.64s)]
*  She loved it that much. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=803.12s)]
*  And I used to go, how'd you do today? [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=805.0400000000001s)]
*  I want $7. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=807.08s)]
*  I'm like, okay, at least you're winning. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=808.5600000000001s)]
*  So her life was around our kids and the grandkids, but her [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=811.72s)]
*  enjoyment was going to bingo. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=816.72s)]
*  Wow. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=819.08s)]
*  So she was kind of, she just found a lot of joy in her family and then some [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=819.28s)]
*  simple place sounds like just simple pleasures kind of. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=822.8000000000001s)]
*  She was very simple. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=825.1600000000001s)]
*  Like she was, um, I'll tell you, when I turned pro, um, I said to my parents, [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=826.24s)]
*  I'm going to buy you a house. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=832.12s)]
*  And my mom and dad said, we don't need a house. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=833.64s)]
*  We were, we're fine right here. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=836.76s)]
*  And I saw there was a little piece of property was an acre just down the street [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=838.76s)]
*  from where, where I grew up and where they were living. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=842.92s)]
*  So I went and bought it secretly and I took them over there and my [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=845.36s)]
*  mom said, what are you doing? [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=850.2s)]
*  I said, well, I'm going to build you this house here. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=851.28s)]
*  You're going to something really special. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=853.32s)]
*  She goes, no, no, my house is fine. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=855.96s)]
*  She goes, but if you want to do something, you can put a pool in her backyard. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=858.16s)]
*  I put a pool in the backyard and sold my piece of properties because they didn't [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=861.76s)]
*  want to move into it and she, and they lived there till the very end. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=865.4s)]
*  And when my dad passed recently, I bought the house. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=869.72s)]
*  And so now it's, I own my house. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=873.2s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=875.44s)]
*  I was going to ask actually where, what that was like. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=875.72s)]
*  So what's your mom was like now that all that skating's done, I [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=878.44s)]
*  want to, I'm going to pull back here. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=880.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=881.9200000000001s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=882.28s)]
*  She said, your dad, your father's not building a hockey rink anymore. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=882.56s)]
*  I want a swimming pool. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=886.0s)]
*  She loved having the swimming pool in the backyard. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=886.92s)]
*  There is something nice about it, isn't it? [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=888.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=890.16s)]
*  And she loved the barbecue. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=890.52s)]
*  I was telling the story, you know, now they have everything so regimented, right? [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=892.1999999999999s)]
*  So back in, back in, when you win the Stanley cup, they have these two [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=897.1199999999999s)]
*  guys that travel with the trophy. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=902.7199999999999s)]
*  Cause it's so special. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=904.4399999999999s)]
*  Like they don't want anything to happen to it and they don't want it to break. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=905.64s)]
*  And so they keep a good eye on it. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=908.9599999999999s)]
*  Right. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=910.64s)]

*  They travel with it. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=921.24s)]
*  Like hit men or whatever. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=922.5600000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=923.6800000000001s)]
*  Oh, my mom got pissed if we got by her nice dishes. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=923.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=926.96s)]
*  So there they are in those days. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=927.2s)]
*  Um, when I, when I won the championship, I remember one day was the summertime. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=929.64s)]
*  I was at my folks' house. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=935.64s)]
*  My mom was doing a barbecue. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=936.88s)]
*  My both grandmothers were there. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=938.44s)]
*  And I'm sitting there and I said to my dad, geez, I should just, I should get [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=940.8000000000001s)]
*  the Stanley cup here and get some pictures. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=945.12s)]
*  So I called the hall of fame and I said, Hey, I'm having a barbecue this afternoon. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=946.6s)]
*  Can you guys drive down the Stanley cup? [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=950.12s)]
*  And they said, yeah, yeah, we'll be down in an hour. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=952.2s)]
*  They got in a car, put the cup in, drove down, gave me the cup. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=954.24s)]
*  We took pictures in the backyard and then they took the cup back to the hall of fame. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=957.36s)]
*  Now it's all organized, right? [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=961.32s)]
*  Now each guy gets a day with the cup. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=962.9200000000001s)]

*  But back then it was just like, Hey, can I have the cup this afternoon? [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=968.12s)]
*  They say, yeah, no problem. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=971.92s)]

*  I wish I had some beans usually. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=987.56s)]
*  Um, yeah, dude, you're like an ice master. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=989.68s)]
*  Do you ever realize, like you kind of mastered like a, or anyway, to me, it seems [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=992.52s)]
*  like, you know, like, do you ever go to like, or you ever at like Disney on ice? [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=997.2s)]
*  You ever take your kids to Disney on ice and you're just like, yeah, you know, [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=1001.1600000000001s)]
*  you're like, those chipmunks are off sides. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=1004.32s)]
*  You know, like, like, do you have that much of a, or when you see an ice maker [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=1006.88s)]
*  on a fridge, you just growl at it. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=1011.76s)]
*  I feel like you just have that. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=1013.36s)]
*  You're a frozen water master. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=1016.24s)]
*  I will tell you this. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=1017.76s)]
*  So I said to somebody the other day, we were on a lake and they said, do you [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=1018.8000000000001s)]
*  want to jump in? [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=1023.0400000000001s)]
*  And it was kind of a cold day. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=1023.76s)]
*  I said, you know, I'm way better when that water's frozen. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=1024.96s)]
*  I'm not going in, but I did go to Disney on ice one time. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=1027.8400000000001s)]
*  Cause my friend and neighbor, Scotty Hamilton, I went to see the show one time. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=1031.3200000000002s)]
*  Scotty Hamilton. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=1036.0s)]
*  He's a dancer. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=1036.68s)]
*  He was a, yeah, he was an Olympic gold medalist. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=1037.72s)]
*  Oh, he's an Olympic gold medalist. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=1039.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=1041.48s)]
*  And then he did figure skater. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=1041.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=1042.88s)]
*  So he was really phenomenal figure skater and a wonderful guy. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=1044.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=1048.0800000000002s)]
*  And a wonderful guy. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=1048.3600000000001s)]
*  So I think he was either Disney on ice or one of those shows. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=1049.16s)]
*  And we went to see it and we sat down by the ice and I think the [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=1052.48s)]
*  time Katerina Vitt was in it. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=1055.88s)]
*  And it was pretty, yeah, it was pretty phenomenal. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=1057.8s)]
*  Like what they can do. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=1061.24s)]
*  It's so different than ice skating. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=1062.2s)]
*  Like I think there's a lot of figure skaters that could transfer to ice skating, [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=1064.3600000000001s)]
*  but I don't think there's a lot of ice skaters that could put on figure [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=1069.76s)]
*  skates and do well. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=1072.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=1074.16s)]
*  It's a whole different thing. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=1074.4s)]
*  They're so athletic. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=1075.72s)]
*  I lived with a guy for like probably four months and he was, uh, I don't know [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=1076.56s)]
*  what he was, he was pretty tall, but he would, he was a figure skater [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=1081.32s)]
*  and he took us outside one time. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=1084.6s)]
*  They had a Volkswagen rabbit outside and he ran and jumped over it from [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=1086.28s)]
*  one side to the other side. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=1090.56s)]
*  That's pretty amazing. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=1092.6399999999999s)]
*  It was just unbelievable. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=1093.48s)]
*  And it was just an afternoon. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=1094.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=1096.24s)]
*  It was just like, it just blew my mind, man. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=1096.48s)]
*  Well, they're, they're, you know, the training and the techniques that they [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=1098.8s)]
*  have because they have to do those turns and they have to get high in the air [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=1102.56s)]
*  to be able to do a triple. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=1105.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=1106.8799999999999s)]
*  So they probably in the off season, they probably do a lot of squat training, [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=1107.1999999999998s)]
*  you know, so that when they do get on the ice, they're there, they're much, [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=1111.9599999999998s)]
*  it's much easier. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=1115.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=1116.56s)]
*  But yeah, they're really, they get out there. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=1117.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=1119.32s)]
*  Those guys can really can do it. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=1119.52s)]
*  I think ice skating is pretty incredible. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=1120.8799999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=1122.48s)]
*  I think we just miss being in the Southern part of the U S we miss all of the [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=1122.6799999999998s)]
*  lacrosse, we miss all of the, you know, the sports, really the, the, the, the, [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=1126.28s)]
*  uh, whatever it's called, the difference of sports just changes over, you know, [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=1132.4799999999998s)]
*  as you go down south. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=1137.3999999999999s)]
*  But, you know, um, I was talking earlier about how popular hockey is and it's [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=1138.8799999999999s)]
*  definitely huge in our country. [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=1144.1999999999998s)]
*  But if you were to go around anywhere and interview people outside of Canada [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=1146.1999999999998s)]
*  and say, what is the national sport of Canada? [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=1151.8s)]
*  They'd all say ice hockey or 90% of them. [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=1154.1999999999998s)]
*  But it's lacrosse. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=1156.9599999999998s)]
*  Actually, yeah, lacrosse. [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=1158.0s)]
*  Lacrosse was invented in six nations reserve, which is just outside [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=1159.6399999999999s)]
*  of my hometown of Brantford. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=1163.56s)]
*  So a couple of things we're very proud of Alexander Graham Bell made his first [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=1165.32s)]
*  phone call from Brantford, my hometown. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=1168.8s)]
*  Did he really? [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=1170.48s)]
*  Yes. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=1171.12s)]
*  Who'd he call? [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=1171.36s)]
*  He called somebody in Paris, Ontario, which was like a 15 minutes away, 15 [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=1172.3999999999999s)]
*  miles away, probably a chick. [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=1177.24s)]
*  I bet. [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=1178.6399999999999s)]
*  If you get your first call, you're going to call probably some woman, you know, [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=1181.0s)]
*  some lady you might want to say, you know, so they actually have the telephone [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=1184.3999999999999s)]
*  in Brantford. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=1188.2s)]
*  No. [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=1189.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=1190.16s)]
*  And the other thing is we're very proud of is that the cross was [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=1190.6s)]
*  invented in Canada. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=1193.96s)]
*  It was a great sport. [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=1195.88s)]
*  Yeah, dude. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=1197.76s)]
*  I didn't even know about Canada. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=1198.08s)]
*  I mean, I didn't even, when I was growing up, we didn't even really [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=1199.0s)]
*  believe in Canada. [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=1201.6s)]
*  You know, I will tell you this in Canada, and I don't mean this to be controversial. [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=1202.4s)]
*  We learned growing up the geography of pretty much the world, but a lot of [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=1208.44s)]
*  Canada and the United States, where American kids kind of grow up. [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=1213.24s)]
*  They didn't learn a whole lot about Canada, that there's provinces, like a [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=1217.0s)]
*  lot of Canadian kids can name every state and every capital, but there's only a [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=1220.5600000000002s)]
*  handful of people I know that can name all the provinces. [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=1225.76s)]
*  Oh, probably 70 people in America. [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=1228.3600000000001s)]
*  I'm not even joking. [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=1230.44s)]
*  I remember in our school, we learned about America, right? [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=1231.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=1234.0800000000002s)]
*  Some kids can barely do that, but then above it on the map, they had a picture [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=1234.3200000000002s)]
*  of a, it was like a wolf chasing a boy, you know, and that was, and we're like, [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=1239.0400000000002s)]
*  what is that? [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=1244.6799999999998s)]
*  And they're like, that's that, you know, that's Canada. [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=1245.28s)]
*  One of the, one of the first things I learned was the capital of Louisiana, [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=1247.9199999999998s)]
*  Baton Rouge. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=1252.2s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=1252.9199999999998s)]
*  I always remember that. [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=1253.48s)]
*  I don't know why I remember that, but I did. [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=1254.52s)]
*  It's a pretty good place. [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=1256.48s)]
*  They had a hockey team for a little while, didn't do well, but. [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=1257.1599999999999s)]
*  I think hockey is going to start going back there now. [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=1259.8s)]
*  You watch, because people are, the greatest thing about our sport are the [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=1261.84s)]
*  people who are in the game, like Ovechkin and Crosby and McDavid and Matthews. [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=1265.8s)]
*  And some of the Bruins too. [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=1271.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=1273.08s)]
*  They're, they're just good, good kids, you know, like they understand, like [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=1273.4399999999998s)]
*  they're hardworking and they, they love, they're unselfish to their teams, but [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=1278.28s)]
*  they're unreal for the league and in their communities, like these kids are [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=1282.56s)]
*  good kids, so our sport is growing and expanding all the time and more and more [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=1285.6799999999998s)]
*  kids are playing hockey in Arizona, Texas, Louisiana, Florida. [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=1291.4399999999998s)]

*  And everybody loves it. [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=1305.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=1306.68s)]
*  So I think more and more kids will start playing hockey and I see our [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=1307.3200000000002s)]
*  game just growing all the time. [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=1310.28s)]
*  Um, what was, was there a part of the game that you like, did you ever play [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=1313.48s)]
*  goalie like, because every time I see clips of you and everything, you're [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=1319.0s)]
*  always not playing goalie, right? [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=1321.68s)]
*  Which is fine. [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=1323.48s)]
*  If I was a goalie, I'd be more like playing dodgeball. [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=1324.4s)]
*  Right. [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=1327.1200000000001s)]
*  I get out of the way. [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=1327.8s)]
*  Did you ever do it to, uh, to learn about what it was like? [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=1329.56s)]
*  Like, did you ever like, [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=1333.32s)]
*  The only time I ever did it was when I was a kid, we played ball hockey. [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=1334.72s)]
*  So ball hockey is played with a tennis ball in running shoes. [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=1339.8799999999999s)]
*  Okay. [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=1343.6799999999998s)]
*  Unlike a sport court or gymnasium. [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=1344.12s)]
*  All right. [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=1346.6399999999999s)]
*  And so the only time I would play goal where I wasn't scared to get hit by a [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=1346.8799999999999s)]
*  puck, it was a tennis ball every now and then I play goal, but I was, listen, [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=1350.76s)]
*  people used to ask me, do you ever block a shot? [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=1355.56s)]
*  And first of all, do you know how hard that puck is? [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=1358.8s)]
*  And for the average hockey fan, they don't realize those pucks are, [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=1361.08s)]
*  every puck is frozen. [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=1365.3999999999999s)]
*  So the pucks that you're using are not only hurt, but they're frozen too. [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=1367.12s)]
*  Who froze them? [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=1371.0s)]
*  So they're in the referee's box. [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=1372.52s)]
*  And so they're frozen, frozen so they don't bounce. [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=1374.72s)]
*  So they, so it doesn't bounce. [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=1378.84s)]
*  Oh really? [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=1380.6s)]
*  Right. [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=1381.08s)]
*  Cause it's made out of what? [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=1381.28s)]
*  Rubber? [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=1382.0s)]
*  Rubber. [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=1382.3999999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=1382.6799999999998s)]
*  So, and so. [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=1383.0s)]
*  And so they used to say to me, do you ever block a shot? [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=1384.96s)]
*  And I said, why would I, that's how, why they pay the goalie. [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=1388.3999999999999s)]
*  That's not my job. [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=1393.32s)]
*  I don't ask him to score goals. [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=1394.1599999999999s)]
*  He doesn't need to ask me to block shots. [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=1396.08s)]
*  I kind of faked it. [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=1398.4399999999998s)]
*  You look, think you're in the lane, but the guy had a lot of room to shoot around you. [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=1399.32s)]

*  is the year I scored 50 goals and 39 games. [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=1632.48s)]
*  And for me, it's my favorite record. [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=1635.0s)]
*  Your third season or something. [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=1636.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=1637.8s)]

*  but to me, that's going to be the hardest record to break to get 50 goals and 38 [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=1642.64s)]
*  games. [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=1646.8000000000002s)]

*  And when you, when you're, when you're a kid and you have an idol, [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=1664.68s)]
*  a lot of times you meet them and you go, I was just okay. [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=1668.04s)]

*  And you go, well, I met Gordie Howe when I was 10 and my dad said to me, [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=1673.24s)]
*  how was meeting Gordie Howe? [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=1677.44s)]
*  And I said, I can't believe it. [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=1678.68s)]
*  And he goes, what? [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=1680.52s)]
*  I said, he was bigger, better, nicer than I ever imagined in my little [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=1681.1200000000001s)]
*  brain at 10 years old, you know? [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=1686.4s)]

*  He was the first guy to shake my hand and give me a hug. [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=1692.2s)]
*  And so, you know, a Vetchkin is going to break my record, which is going [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=1695.32s)]
*  to be great for our game and when he does, I'll be there for him. [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=1699.52s)]

*  So it was a big day. [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=1720.52s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=1721.56s)]
*  Dude, look at, you know, you look, you know who you look like a little bit? [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=1723.12s)]
*  You know who I'm going to say or no? [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=1727.16s)]
*  No, no idea. [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=1728.3999999999999s)]
*  Princess Diana a little. [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=1729.52s)]
*  Just the fact that she's a female. [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=1734.12s)]
*  I don't know if that that's a compliment or not. [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=1735.68s)]
*  And I just mean, look, man, and I think it's very much, she was a tough lady. [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=1737.96s)]
*  I've heard it before. [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=1742.72s)]
*  Yeah, you have. [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=1743.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=1744.56s)]
*  Yeah, man. [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=1744.92s)]
*  I think God. [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=1745.68s)]
*  Every now and then when my hair is a little whatever, some guys say, [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=1746.44s)]
*  gosh, you got Rod Stewart hair. [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=1749.12s)]
*  Oh, I think there's. [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=1750.6399999999999s)]
*  I bet a couple of men played on your team just because they wanted to be near you. [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=1752.08s)]
*  But no, Gordy was so nice. [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=1756.76s)]
*  He was just, so it was a dinner. [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=1759.08s)]
*  It was a charity dinner. [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=1761.84s)]
*  I was like, this is an incredible story and 700 people were at the dinner and that [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=1762.8s)]
*  was the year I scored 400 goals. [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=1768.3600000000001s)]
*  So the city wanted me to be part of it. [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=1770.52s)]
*  And you know, when you're 10 years old, you can't even stand up and do a speech [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=1773.04s)]
*  in front of your classmates, right? [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=1776.52s)]
*  So they had told the guy, you're only 10 at this time. [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=1778.1200000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=1780.44s)]
*  So they had told the MC Wayne's just introduce him. [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=1780.64s)]
*  He's not going to talk. [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=1783.3200000000002s)]
*  And so, um, Joe Theismann was there. [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=1784.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=1788.8000000000002s)]
*  Gordy how, when you were 10, yes, Sandy Hawley, a famous jockey. [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=1789.3200000000002s)]
*  And so they all get up and they kind of talk for seven or eight [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=1793.4s)]
*  minutes and people laugh and giggle. [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=1795.96s)]
*  So the guy announces my name and I'm like, Oh no, I'm already frozen. [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=1797.8000000000002s)]
*  And Gordy says to me, now listen, when you go up there, just tell them your [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=1802.76s)]
*  loss of your skates and your hockey stick. [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=1805.76s)]
*  And so I got, okay, okay. [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=1808.2800000000002s)]
*  So I got up there and I was shaking and I remember I said, thank you. [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=1809.48s)]
*  And I started bawling. [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=1814.04s)]
*  I got a standing ovation. [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=1815.44s)]
*  I went and sat down. [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=1816.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=1817.44s)]
*  Years later, I called a friend of mine called me and he said, Gordy's [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=1819.1200000000001s)]
*  hometown of Saskatoon, they're doing this charity dinner. [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=1823.8s)]
*  It's like a lion's club, which was very similar to one I did in my hometown. [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=1827.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=1832.64s)]
*  We had lion's club in our town. [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=1832.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=1834.08s)]
*  So I called Gordy and his son, Mark. [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=1834.52s)]
*  And I said, listen, Gordy came to my hometown when I was 10. [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=1837.44s)]
*  I really liked Gordy to come with me to Saskatoon. [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=1841.92s)]
*  And I want to surprise everybody. [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=1844.6000000000001s)]
*  So we were in Saskatoon this dinner and they had sold, I think there [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=1846.6000000000001s)]
*  was about 3000 people there and the prime minister of Canada happened to be in [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=1850.28s)]
*  town and he called me and he says, okay, if I come over there and sort of MC this [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=1854.28s)]
*  and ask you a few questions for the people. [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=1859.44s)]
*  And I said, absolutely, no problem at all. [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=1861.6000000000001s)]
*  So I said, oh, by the way, nobody knows this, but I flew Gordy and he's at the [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=1864.72s)]
*  hotel and Gordy is going to come tonight and we're going to introduce them. [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=1869.2s)]
*  Well, it was like, I wasn't there anymore. [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=1872.92s)]
*  The prime minister was like, okay, maybe somebody will do you and I'll do Gordy. [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=1875.1200000000001s)]
*  So anyway, when I got up on stage, I said to everybody, I got a great surprise. [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=1880.28s)]
*  He, I met him in my hometown and I figured I should come to his hometown. [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=1886.0s)]
*  And Gordy Howe came out and I swear to God, if people didn't stop [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=1890.12s)]
*  clapping, they'd still be clapping today because it was the most, it was the [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=1895.0s)]
*  longest, nicest standing ovation that I've ever seen somebody get. [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=1898.08s)]
*  And he was so genuinely loved. [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=1903.28s)]
*  And he, it was such, he was a really, people don't realize this. [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=1905.8799999999999s)]
*  Gordy Howe was a dirty player. [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=1909.16s)]
*  First time I play against him, I took the puck from him. [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=1910.84s)]
*  And next thing you know, I got a whack. [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=1913.52s)]
*  I was 17 years old and he cracked my thumb. [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=1915.28s)]
*  He said, don't ever take the puck from me again. [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=1917.24s)]
*  I said, okay, never going to happen again. [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=1919.48s)]
*  Anyway, so he got such an ovation. [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=1921.68s)]
*  And after the event, we went back to the hotel and Gordy had brought back a [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=1925.0s)]
*  couple of his buddies that he knew they hadn't seen in a while, a couple of older [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=1929.24s)]
*  gentlemen, and we just sat around and he had a, he had a, remember he sat there [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=1932.8000000000002s)]
*  and he had a cold beer and he said, this was one of the greatest days, greatest [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=1937.88s)]
*  nights of my life. [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=1942.24s)]
*  So it was very cool. [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=1943.2s)]
*  When you, when you look at like, um, like when you were a kid, was most of your [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=1945.72s)]
*  relationship with your dad, like hockey, like, was it tough to, cause if you [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=1950.2s)]
*  became like, if you excelled at something early, right. [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=1955.1200000000001s)]
*  And a lot of times fathers and sons will, it's tough for fathers and sons to find [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=1959.0800000000002s)]
*  like a common ground sometimes to connect on things, you know, parents are always [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=1963.2s)]
*  putting their kids into different things and, and dads are always trying to connect [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=1966.8000000000002s)]
*  with their children, you know, was there other ways that you could, like, was that [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=1970.16s)]
*  most of y'all's relationship? [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=1974.52s)]
*  Like, I'm just kind of like, I guess I'm curious like what it was like. [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=1976.16s)]
*  We had a normal relationship, like normal father son. [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=1979.6399999999999s)]
*  Um, he was both parents tremendously supportive. [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=1982.8799999999999s)]
*  Um, you know, by the time I was 10, 11, 12 years old, I was playing in [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=1988.04s)]
*  arenas that were selling out. [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=1992.28s)]
*  That's crazy. [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=1994.56s)]
*  You were like a circuses in town. [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=1995.52s)]
*  Little bit. [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=1997.2s)]
*  And I mean, not like that, but I know what I mean, but in those days too, it was [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=1998.28s)]
*  such a big world because there was no internet, there was no cell phones. [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=2002.08s)]
*  And so a kid might be three hours away and you would hear about them. [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=2006.6s)]
*  And then when you play against them, my dad would be in the card and after the [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=2012.76s)]
*  game, he would say to me, his favorite line was always, no matter how good you [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=2016.72s)]
*  think you are, there's somebody out there better than you. [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=2021.6799999999998s)]
*  And I'd say, okay. [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=2024.08s)]
*  And even when I was 15, 16, when people said, okay, he's going to be a [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=2025.32s)]
*  professional hockey player. [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=2028.52s)]
*  My dad never one time said, you know, oh, he's a, can't miss or he's going to make [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=2029.68s)]
*  it. [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=2035.24s)]
*  I mean, he hoped because he knew how much I loved it, but he never pressured me. [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=2035.48s)]
*  The only thing he pressured me about is he would call me, say, you [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=2039.76s)]
*  didn't miss any classes today. [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=2043.5600000000002s)]
*  So he's like, oh yeah. [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=2044.8400000000001s)]
*  He, I said, dad, I don't miss class because if I miss class, the team, so I [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=2046.0400000000002s)]
*  was playing junior hockey and it was hard cause we practiced every day and we [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=2051.12s)]
*  travel a lot. [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=2055.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=2056.12s)]
*  And so they were, the team was always on you. [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=2056.6s)]
*  Like you better be in class. [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=2059.44s)]
*  So he was more concerned that I was in class. [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=2061.16s)]
*  I remember I was 17 and I had this school teacher and he, it was, I was [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=2064.12s)]
*  taking a physics class and I hated physics and chemistry was, I kept [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=2071.6s)]
*  thinking, no, where's this going to, where am I going to use this in the world? [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=2075.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=2078.84s)]
*  That's all I kept thinking. [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=2079.12s)]
*  Um, anyway, and he said, if you just put the work in, I'll pass you. [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=2080.6s)]
*  So I did. [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=2084.88s)]
*  I went to class. [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=2085.44s)]
*  I went to an extra class every day with him and he worked an [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=2086.16s)]
*  extra half hour every day. [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=2089.64s)]
*  He passed me. [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=2090.6s)]
*  And that was the year that month I got offered to turn pro and I signed a pro [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=2091.68s)]
*  contract and I remember I came back and I bought him a gift. [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=2096.88s)]
*  It wasn't a whole, it wasn't a big thing. [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=2100.88s)]
*  It was like a briefcase or something thanking him for not, for being so [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=2102.96s)]
*  patient with me and being so nice to me. [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=2107.52s)]
*  He was so grateful. [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=2109.32s)]
*  And it was always sort of when I signed, my dad said, you're going to stay pro [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=2110.6s)]
*  hockey, you're going to stay in high school till you're 18. [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=2116.08s)]
*  I don't care what you do, but you're going to school till you're 18. [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=2119.12s)]
*  So here I am playing pro hockey. [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=2122.0s)]
*  I was going to high school. [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=2123.72s)]
*  I was picking up my teammates daughter. [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=2124.96s)]
*  We were in the same class. [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=2126.64s)]
*  The guy's name was Jim Nilsson and I would pick his daughter up. [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=2129.88s)]
*  We were in the same school, same class. [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=2132.84s)]
*  Then I go to practice. [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=2134.56s)]
*  You were like Ice Vist Presley. [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=2136.2s)]
*  So the principal called me in one day and he said, son, I don't know, you're [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=2138.52s)]
*  not going to mount to anything. [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=2142.6s)]
*  You're missing too many classes. [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=2143.64s)]
*  I'm like, well, and he said, you know, I should just kick you out. [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=2145.9199999999996s)]
*  And I said, listen, it was like early January. [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=2150.0s)]
*  And I said, listen, do me a favor. [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=2152.3199999999997s)]
*  And he goes, what? [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=2153.64s)]
*  I said, give me till January 26th. [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=2154.16s)]
*  And if I haven't changed my act by then, you can kick me out. [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=2156.64s)]
*  But I knew I couldn't go to class because we're always traveling and playing. [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=2160.68s)]
*  I was playing pro hockey, playing in Quebec city and going to Cincinnati. [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=2163.48s)]
*  And did you have an ego? [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=2167.3599999999997s)]
*  Were you in class? [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=2168.3599999999997s)]
*  Were you like the Fonz at this point in class? [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=2168.9199999999996s)]
*  I sat in the back corner. [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=2170.7999999999997s)]
*  I just mind my own business. [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=2172.16s)]
*  So the day I turned 18, I walked into the principal and I said, I just want to [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=2173.9199999999996s)]
*  thank you for not kicking me out, but I quit, I'm done. [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=2178.7999999999997s)]
*  And I quit school. [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=2181.56s)]
*  And I said, I called my dad and my dad said, well, you promised me to stay to 18. [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=2182.68s)]
*  Cause the contract wasn't valid unless he would sign it. [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=2188.2s)]
*  Unless your father would sign it. [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=2192.24s)]
*  Cause I wasn't 18 yet. [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=2193.2799999999997s)]
*  And so he said, I'll sign it, but you got to stay in high school. [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=2195.12s)]
*  So did you ever finish high school technically? [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=2199.4s)]
*  Um, no, but I'm a doctor. [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=2201.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=2202.88s)]
*  Does that mean anything? [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=2204.96s)]
*  I'm an honorary doctor. [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=2206.88s)]
*  So it's funny. [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=2210.68s)]
*  Most of the 12 grades. [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=2212.04s)]
*  I think that's a lot. [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=2213.08s)]
*  People are always like, you got to do all of them. [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=2214.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=2215.6s)]
*  Um, I always, yeah, you know what? [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=2216.04s)]
*  I, I, I'm an honorary doctor. [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=2218.48s)]
*  It's funny. [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=2220.0s)]
*  I did the commencement speech for, I said, okay, I'm going to pick one. [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=2221.12s)]
*  And people have been kind enough to offer me. [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=2224.72s)]
*  And I said, I'm, you know what? [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=2227.4s)]
*  I'm going to do one. [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=2228.12s)]
*  And so I picked the university of Alberta, which is in Edmonton, [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=2228.92s)]
*  which I thought was fitting. [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=2231.8s)]
*  And I have, it's so funny because I have different nicknames. [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=2234.04s)]
*  So in the hockey world, they call me Gratz. [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=2237.56s)]
*  Gratzky great one. [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=2241.16s)]
*  No, just Gratz. [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=2242.36s)]
*  Gratz. [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=2243.8s)]
*  And in the golf world, they call me Doc. [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=2244.7599999999998s)]
*  Cause I was telling the guys one day, I was playing with, I think it was [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=2247.84s)]
*  Dustin and Jordan Spieth. [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=2250.68s)]

*  So I'm into that effect. [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=2254.84s)]
*  So the golf world calls me Doc and the hockey world calls me Gratz. [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=2256.16s)]

*  AFL, and they were signing kids under 20. [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=2343.56s)]
*  It seems illegal in some places. [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=2347.32s)]
*  I mean, it's like how. [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=2348.92s)]
*  Well, so I signed, but had there not been that league, I might've had to play another [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=2350.36s)]
*  three years of junior. [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=2355.4s)]

*  Right. [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=2357.52s)]

*  Right. [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=2358.68s)]

*  You love it that much. [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=2370.96s)]
*  Huh? [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=2371.84s)]
*  So I'll give you an example. [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=2372.08s)]
*  When I was 15 years old, I was playing on a junior hockey team and it was so [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=2374.04s)]
*  exciting because my, one of my teammates was Murray Howe who was [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=2379.6s)]
*  Gordy Howe's youngest son. [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=2384.2s)]
*  Oh, wow. [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=2385.68s)]
*  And he's just a wonderful kid. [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=2386.56s)]
*  And I wore number nine that year because I always loved Gordy. [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=2388.2400000000002s)]
*  And so when he came in, I said, look, you should wear number nine. [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=2391.84s)]
*  Your dad's Gordy Howe, which my number and he was no, no, no, no. [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=2394.32s)]
*  You see Wayne, this is my last year of hockey. [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=2398.0s)]
*  Um, I'm going to enjoy it. [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=2401.56s)]
*  And I go, okay. [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=2403.6800000000003s)]
*  And he goes, I'm going to be a doctor. [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=2404.36s)]
*  He was a really intelligent guy and he did go on to become a doctor. [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=2405.96s)]
*  So we get on the team bus and we traveled to the city. [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=2409.28s)]
*  He, he'd get on there and he'd have all these books, right. [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=2413.88s)]
*  And I'd get on no books. [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=2417.28s)]
*  And he goes, Wayne, you got, you got to get your education. [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=2418.76s)]
*  You got to, I go, I'm going to a hockey game. [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=2421.96s)]
*  I can't think about reading right now and doing homework. [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=2424.04s)]
*  And so about two weeks later, I got on the bus and I had like five or six books. [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=2427.12s)]
*  I sit down beside him and he, he goes, good to see you taking notes here, [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=2432.48s)]
*  Wayne, that's good. [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=2436.56s)]
*  Good for you. [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=2437.2799999999997s)]
*  And he said, he goes, what do you got? [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=2438.64s)]
*  Geography, history. [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=2440.04s)]
*  I go, well, I got Gordy Howe hockey, my way Gordy Howe hockey tips. [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=2441.6s)]
*  I said, you want to be a doctor. [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=2447.0s)]
*  You want to be a doctor. [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=2449.4s)]
*  I want to be a hockey player. [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=2450.44s)]
*  But he went on to be a tremendous doctor and he actually gave the eulogy for his [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=2451.76s)]
*  dad's funeral when he went and Gordy passed away, which was pretty remarkable. [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=2457.2400000000002s)]
*  Um, do you, did you speak at your dad's funeral? [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=2462.32s)]
*  What was that like? [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=2465.68s)]
*  Yeah, I did. [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=2467.16s)]
*  I spoke both at my mom and my dad's. [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=2467.72s)]
*  Um, and sorry to hear. [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=2470.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=2472.0s)]
*  Sorry about your fault. [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=2472.2s)]
*  Yeah, it was, you know what? [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=2473.32s)]
*  It was funny because there's something that just takes over inside you that [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=2476.16s)]
*  you get through it, right? [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=2479.68s)]
*  Like I remember when my mom passed, my dad called me and said, you know, will [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=2481.08s)]
*  you speak? [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=2486.12s)]
*  And I said, of course. [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=2486.68s)]
*  So when my dad was passing, my brothers and my sister said, you know, will you [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=2488.08s)]
*  speak? [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=2492.2s)]
*  And I said, yeah. [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=2492.7599999999998s)]
*  The ironic thing was when my dad passed, we were still in the midst of the [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=2494.2799999999997s)]
*  pandemic. [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=2498.9199999999996s)]
*  So it was actually, in a lot of ways, it was nice for our family because there's [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=2500.3999999999996s)]
*  only 22 of us there and you know, cause you couldn't, you couldn't invite [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=2505.16s)]
*  everybody. [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=2509.8799999999997s)]
*  Had it, had it not been at that time, he probably would have had to get buried or [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=2510.8399999999997s)]
*  had the funeral in a hockey arena with so many people. [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=2514.8399999999997s)]
*  He was so loved by so many people. [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=2518.08s)]
*  So when I, I found both times sitting there going, oh, this is going to be hard. [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=2520.64s)]
*  And then when I got up there, it just kind of flowed because my dad, when I [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=2526.68s)]
*  spoke at his, he was so religious, my dad. [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=2532.64s)]
*  And you know, he never missed church on a Sunday when every Sunday and he used [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=2535.3999999999996s)]
*  to tease the kids because he tried out for the church choir and they wouldn't [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=2540.64s)]
*  let him in it. [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=2544.7999999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=2548.12s)]
*  So there was a little boy across the street who was disabled and blind. [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=2548.6s)]
*  And my dad picked them up every morning at 10 a.m., every Sunday morning at 10 [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=2554.12s)]
*  a.m. and took them to church every Sunday and then brought them back home. [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=2557.08s)]
*  We've taken McDonald's and then back home and he did it every Sunday. [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=2560.92s)]
*  So when my dad was passing, he's so religious, but I remember he was still [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=2564.48s)]
*  fighting to stay down here, so to speak. [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=2568.8s)]
*  He was 22 days, you know, basically on a deathbed, right? [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=2574.6000000000004s)]
*  And the minister would come every night at our house and he would give [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=2578.7200000000003s)]
*  him his last rites. [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=2583.2400000000002s)]
*  And I said, yeah, I say to the minister, my dad's got the biggest hurt. [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=2584.76s)]
*  You're coming. [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=2588.6000000000004s)]
*  I'll see you tomorrow. [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=2589.0800000000004s)]
*  So anyway, when, when we did give the, when I did give the ULG, I could feel [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=2591.1600000000003s)]
*  like he was there and he got me through it. [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=2596.72s)]
*  Wow. [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=2599.04s)]
*  That's fascinating, man. [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=2600.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=2601.52s)]
*  I remember I went to my dad's funeral. [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=2601.64s)]
*  It's like, I don't know. [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=2603.0s)]
*  It's just such a strength. [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=2605.52s)]
*  It's such a, I don't know. [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=2606.72s)]
*  It's wild seeing something like that happen. [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=2609.3599999999997s)]
*  I think, do you think it helped that your father had such a faith? [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=2611.52s)]
*  Did he give you so like a, [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=2615.7599999999998s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=2616.8799999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=2617.12s)]
*  Like he knew his life after death, he was going to see his mother. [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=2617.3599999999997s)]
*  He's going to see his father. [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=2621.16s)]
*  So he's probably part of him was probably excited, huh? [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=2622.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=2624.4399999999996s)]
*  I think, yeah, in some ways, but I think he wanted to be here as long as he could. [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=2625.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=2630.2400000000002s)]
*  He loved being around his grandkids. [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=2630.48s)]
*  He loved being around people. [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=2632.16s)]
*  He was just really special in that sense. [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=2634.08s)]
*  You know, I don't, not too often you can say that people don't have enemies, but [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=2637.04s)]
*  I don't think my dad had an enemy. [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=2642.88s)]
*  Like he was beloved by everyone. [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=2644.28s)]
*  I remember one time I came home and when I would go home and visit them every [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=2646.6s)]
*  now and then, you know, my dad would tell the whole city, right? [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=2652.48s)]
*  That you were coming? [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=2656.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=2656.76s)]
*  So I got smart on that. [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=2657.0s)]
*  And I, I, I call my mom and I'd say, I'll be home tomorrow. [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=2658.8s)]
*  Don't tell dad. [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=2661.48s)]
*  So I get there in the morning. [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=2662.92s)]
*  This is hilarious. [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=2665.28s)]
*  And I walk in and there's a guy lying on the couch. [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=2666.36s)]
*  I get over to my mom and I kind of know everybody that goes in and out of our [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=2670.84s)]
*  house, you know, my mom was in the kitchen and I said, who's lying on the couch? [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=2673.96s)]
*  Who is that? [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=2678.0s)]
*  She goes, I don't know. [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=2679.04s)]
*  Um, but he's hitchhiking across the country from Newfoundland, wanted to see [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=2680.2s)]
*  the house, so your dad told him to spend the night and have a good meal. [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=2683.64s)]
*  So that's the kind of guy my dad was. [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=2687.68s)]
*  And the guy spent the night and got up in the morning and him and I had coffee. [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=2689.44s)]
*  He got to get a picture with my Jersey on when I happened to be home that day. [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=2695.96s)]
*  And he was hitchhiking the rest of Canada. [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=2699.6s)]
*  That was the kind of dad my dad was. [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=2702.24s)]
*  Wow. [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=2703.44s)]
*  They should put him, they should put him in a Jersey and let's let him hitchhike [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=2704.2799999999997s)]
*  the country forever and just make it like a thing, you know? [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=2707.0s)]
*  Well, you know, it's not the Stanley Cup, but Hey guys, have you met Stanley [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=2709.8799999999997s)]
*  and everybody just picks him up? [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=2713.8799999999997s)]
*  There you go. [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=2715.12s)]

*  And she gets around on her own. [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=2744.28s)]
*  It's truly remarkable. [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=2745.7200000000003s)]
*  And what's amazing is that unfortunately her dad passed away at 56, uh, which is [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=2747.0400000000004s)]

*  like leaving this earth, you know, and passing away from here, I think about [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=2813.68s)]
*  just getting some good rest, you know, it's kind of the way I think about it in my [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=2816.92s)]
*  head. [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=2820.56s)]

*  Cause if you're always doing hockey, it seemed like you were probably always on [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=2825.72s)]
*  the run. [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=2828.2s)]
*  Did y'all ever go to Florida or somewhere or the North Pole? [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=2828.48s)]
*  That's funny. [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=2832.7999999999997s)]
*  The North Pole. [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=2833.32s)]
*  Um, well, two things are, are my mom's life. [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=2834.32s)]
*  And this is sometimes she would complain about this. [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=2839.2s)]
*  Uh, so in the winter time was hockey tournaments, summertime was lacrosse [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=2841.7999999999997s)]
*  and baseball tournaments. [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=2846.08s)]
*  So that was our vacations. [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=2847.24s)]
*  And then every three years, my dad's sister, uh, cause my parents, grandparents [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=2849.2s)]
*  in the fifties had tobacco farms and people from the South would come up to [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=2854.64s)]
*  work in the summer. [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=2858.9199999999996s)]
*  Cause the season for picking is a little different. [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=2859.9599999999996s)]
*  So they can make money in Canada and then go back. [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=2862.4399999999996s)]

*  He married my dad's sister and every two years we would go down there for two [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=2867.3599999999997s)]
*  weeks, we would drive down for two weeks. [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=2870.72s)]
*  Um, and, and, um, stay there with our cousins and my aunt and uncle. [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=2873.64s)]
*  And that was probably our vacation. [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=2879.2s)]
*  Right. [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=2881.2799999999997s)]
*  Uh, I remember one time driving back, I convinced my parents to stop in [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=2882.16s)]
*  Cooperstown, which was a little out of the way. [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=2885.64s)]
*  And my mom was so mad. [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=2888.3599999999997s)]
*  She said, we spent an extra six hours driving so you could go to Cooperstown. [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=2890.16s)]
*  And my dad would say, this is good for him. [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=2894.72s)]
*  That's okay. [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=2896.4399999999996s)]
*  Oh, that's so much fun. [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=2899.3999999999996s)]
*  Man, I love it. [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=2901.44s)]
*  Even when you were talking about like the lore, like back in the day, if you had, [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=2902.48s)]
*  like, if you heard about a kid playing, you'd have to go and see him. [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=2905.08s)]
*  Yeah, that was the way it was back then. [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=2908.9199999999996s)]
*  Oh, there was something so much more magical about like lore. [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=2910.3599999999997s)]
*  Like they don't have as much of it anymore because everybody, you know, [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=2913.8799999999997s)]
*  everybody, I don't know, but you know, the funny thing is, like, if you say to [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=2917.3599999999997s)]
*  kids today, like New York to London, England, it's not that far. [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=2922.3599999999997s)]
*  We used to think Bramford to Windsor, Ontario, which was a two and a half hour [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=2927.7200000000003s)]
*  drive was like going to the other side of the world, right? [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=2931.52s)]
*  Like the world was so much bigger back then. [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=2934.44s)]
*  Oh, we thought Florida. [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=2936.48s)]
*  If we saw somebody had a shirt on in Louisiana, it said Florida on it. [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=2937.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=2940.68s)]

*  You must be the richest guy here. [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=2943.2000000000003s)]

*  It was like, dang, you've been to Florida? [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=2947.0s)]
*  We never got to Florida, but we got to Carolina, which was really nice. [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=2948.68s)]
*  It was great going with our relatives. [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=2953.16s)]
*  That was awesome. [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=2954.88s)]
*  And when you guys just all get in the car and just drive down there? [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=2955.2400000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=2957.3199999999997s)]
*  We had a, um, old car, a station wagon. [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=2957.6s)]
*  Um, where would you sit? [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=2961.68s)]
*  I was always, uh, in the backseat, you know, and then. [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=2963.48s)]
*  Well, it's like school. [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=2967.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=2968.12s)]
*  And we would drive and gosh, we didn't have air conditioning in our car. [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=2968.6s)]
*  So every now and then you rolled on the window. [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=2973.2s)]
*  So it wasn't as hot. [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=2974.7999999999997s)]
*  Uh, but then you get down to Carolina and was so humid, right? [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=2976.12s)]
*  You'd be like, Oh, put the windows up and let's sweat. [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=2978.96s)]
*  Um, so my dad used to always tease me, uh, when I was 14, 13, 14, 15, you'd [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=2981.72s)]
*  always say, if you do make professional hockey, you just remember, but I [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=2989.08s)]
*  just find me a Cadillac. [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=2992.2799999999997s)]
*  So I bought him one of those big Brits Cadillacs and I brought it home. [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=2994.3999999999996s)]
*  Right. [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=2997.16s)]
*  So the summer goes by, the year goes by, go back home the next summer. [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=2998.12s)]
*  And I look at the car and there's like 80 miles on it. [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=3002.7999999999997s)]
*  And I will go in. [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=3005.8799999999997s)]
*  I said to my mom, I said, I bought dad this car. [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=3006.4399999999996s)]
*  Why is he not driving it? [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=3009.64s)]
*  She goes, he does. [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=3011.08s)]
*  He can't drive it to work. [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=3012.3199999999997s)]

*  It was your girlfriend. [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=3229.12s)]
*  I didn't have one. [[00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=3230.48s)]

*  Yeah. [[00:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=3232.28s)]
*  Just, you know, I had a junior aid coach when I was 16 years old playing with 19, [[00:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=3232.88s)]
*  20 year olds. [[00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=3239.48s)]
*  And he would say, playing junior hockey is really hard. [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=3240.24s)]
*  But being a professional hockey player is a great life. [[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=3244.92s)]
*  And so you said you got hockey, you got schooling and you got nightlife and you [[00:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=3247.2799999999997s)]
*  can only do two of the three. [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=3254.88s)]
*  So make sure you pick the right two. [[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=3256.2s)]
*  So when you're 16 years old, it was my life. [[00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=3257.56s)]
*  I loved, lived and died it. [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=3260.48s)]
*  Go to school from 830 at three o'clock, practice four to six every night, play [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=3262.8399999999997s)]
*  usually Thursday, Saturday, Sunday, back to school, same thing. [[00:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=3268.2s)]
*  When you, when you see it, like how you were compared to like how some other [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=3272.68s)]
*  players were, right? [[00:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=3276.08s)]
*  Did you think that you almost had like a, uh, abnormality, how much you liked [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=3277.44s)]
*  it or how much you focused on it? [[00:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=3284.04s)]
*  Like, was it that kind of thing? [[00:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=3285.12s)]
*  Um, because I see players, I have friends that are good at things and [[00:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=3287.4s)]
*  friends that really are. [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=3290.72s)]
*  Let's put it this way. [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=3291.6s)]
*  Um, I knew there's a lot of other really good players and athletes, but for us, [[00:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=3292.52s)]
*  for me, you know, especially when I got to be 16, I knew, I knew that was my life. [[00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=3297.8399999999997s)]
*  Like I knew it wasn't going to be a great student. [[00:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=3303.52s)]
*  Um, I knew it was going to be hard for me to get a college degree. [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=3307.24s)]
*  I understood that. [[00:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=3311.4s)]
*  I knew my forte was going to be hockey and growing up playing baseball, track [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=3312.48s)]
*  and field, lacrosse, and I encourage parents all the time, all those [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=3318.4s)]
*  sports helped my hockey. [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=3322.44s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=3323.84s)]
*  And so by the time I got to 16, I was like, okay, this is what I'm going to do. [[00:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=3324.4s)]
*  I want to be a professional hockey player. [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=3328.0s)]
*  Um, and so I, I really, that was my focus and the only advice my dad used to say, [[00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=3331.52s)]
*  give me really was, um, you got a great opportunity here to really have a [[00:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=3337.8s)]
*  wonderful life and the good Lord blessed you with a love and a passion. [[00:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=3343.04s)]
*  Like I've never seen before and sort of like, don't blow it, don't throw it away. [[00:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=3348.0s)]
*  And so I always kind of thought that that I never thought I was missing out [[00:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=3352.76s)]
*  going to a different city or going here or doing this. [[00:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=3357.04s)]
*  If I was, my enjoyment was being on the ice. [[00:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=3362.12s)]
*  I didn't think I was missing anything else. [[00:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=3365.84s)]
*  Like, I never even, never even faced me. [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=3368.2s)]
*  Yeah, that was the thing. [[00:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=3370.96s)]
*  You know, I can remember, um, my dad saying, you know, you're going to have so [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=3372.88s)]
*  many opportunities here for some reason, you know, with your aunt being down [[00:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=3379.44s)]
*  syndrome and you growing up with that and the Canadian Institute for the Blind [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=3383.64s)]
*  was in my hometown of Brantford. [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=3388.96s)]
*  Like there's more than just hockey. [[00:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=3390.7599999999998s)]
*  Like you're going to be one day, you're going to be a symbol for good things. [[00:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=3393.04s)]
*  And so I always, I kind of grew up with it, right? [[00:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=3397.64s)]
*  It was, that was kind of my education. [[00:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=3400.48s)]
*  What a powerful thing to say to a child too, you know, that they have the, that [[00:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=3402.28s)]
*  they, if they do their best, you know, not even do their best, but if they [[00:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=3405.64s)]
*  make it, they make enough effort that they have a, the possibility to be a [[00:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=3411.36s)]
*  symbol for, for good, that's really powerful. [[00:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=3415.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=3418.84s)]
*  And so, you know, I just, I mean, that's, I guess, you know, I became Wayne Gretzky [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=3419.28s)]
*  and so just had a love for it. [[00:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=3425.88s)]
*  That's all. [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=3428.48s)]
*  Is it hard? [[00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=3429.52s)]
*  Like, [[00:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=3430.0800000000004s)]
*  trust me, there was a lot of guys with more talent than I had. [[00:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=3431.44s)]
*  Right. [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=3434.0s)]

*  Really? [[00:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=3436.6800000000003s)]
*  And then there's some guys that I just wanted it more than. [[00:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=3437.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=3440.0s)]
*  But, but by no means was I the best player ever. [[00:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=3440.2400000000002s)]
*  There was so many great players. [[00:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=3443.36s)]
*  Did any players ever smoke cigarettes like at halftime or whatever? [[00:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=3445.36s)]
*  No, it kind of faded out in the late seventies, you know, sixties and seventies. [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=3448.92s)]
*  People grew up with that. [[00:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=3454.8s)]
*  Unfortunately, that's what happened to my mother. [[00:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=3455.92s)]
*  She was a smoker 16 years old, but that was that era. [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=3457.84s)]
*  Right? [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=3461.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=3461.32s)]
*  And there was, there were not a lot of hockey players who smoked, but there was a few, [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=3461.7200000000003s)]
*  but by 1980, that was all it was gone. [[00:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=3465.88s)]
*  Sometimes you like to romanticize seeing somebody spark, you know. [[00:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=3469.76s)]
*  Well, I think it was Mickey Mantle or Joe DiMaggio. [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=3472.6800000000003s)]
*  Didn't they do ads for cigarettes in the 50s? [[00:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=3476.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=3478.6400000000003s)]
*  Isn't that crazy? [[00:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=3478.6800000000003s)]
*  They used to get paid to be on pictures and everybody just kind of accepted it. [[00:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=3479.28s)]
*  And now they get mad if you endorse betting. [[00:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=3484.72s)]
*  That's the new big thing. [[00:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=3489.3999999999996s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=3490.56s)]
*  A lot of people are doing that now. [[00:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=3490.7999999999997s)]
*  Everything's kind of become like every, a lot of the ads now are gambling. [[00:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=3492.24s)]
*  I think a lot of people are gambling on stuff. [[00:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=3495.3599999999997s)]
*  And all the owners, they don't, a lot of them own their own places and you know, [[00:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=3497.3999999999996s)]
*  all sports, baseball, basketball, football. [[00:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=3501.2799999999997s)]
*  So, you know, I just did a wonderful commercial with Jamie Foxx for bet MGM. [[00:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=3503.2799999999997s)]
*  And I had a ball doing it with a guy. [[00:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=3508.04s)]
*  Yeah, it was fun. [[00:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=3510.56s)]
*  Did y'all wear tuxedos or something? [[00:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=3511.3199999999997s)]
*  We were suits though. [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=3512.8799999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=3513.88s)]
*  Their ads always had like a polished look. [[00:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=3514.04s)]
*  Yeah, it was pretty cool. [[00:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=3516.04s)]
*  He was, it was his first working day after his injury. [[00:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=3517.04s)]
*  Um, but he was great. [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=3520.4s)]
*  He was fine. [[00:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=3521.6400000000003s)]
*  And he was, he worked all night the night before. [[00:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=3522.32s)]
*  And then he worked all night with me that night. [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=3524.52s)]
*  Had you ever worked with him before now? [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=3526.7200000000003s)]
*  No, I hadn't worked with him before, but you know, small world, we lived five [[00:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=3528.08s)]
*  minutes apart in a thousand Oaks. [[00:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=3531.88s)]
*  So I used to see him periodically at different things, but he was beloved in [[00:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=3534.88s)]
*  the community and another guy, he really didn't have any enemies. [[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=3538.6400000000003s)]
*  Everybody loved him. [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=3541.6800000000003s)]
*  Well, he's one of the most telling. [[00:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=3542.52s)]
*  I mean, people forget also that he's a standup comedian and how great he was. [[00:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=3543.44s)]
*  And living color was like the best TV show they ever had when I was growing up. [[00:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=3548.16s)]
*  He, he, the Jamie Foxx show was unbelievable. [[00:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=3551.48s)]
*  He was so talented and then he went to Oscar for, uh, forget. [[00:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=3554.7200000000003s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=3560.04s)]
*  Muhammad Ali, maybe. [[00:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=3560.4s)]
*  No, it was, uh, Ray. [[00:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=3561.52s)]
*  Um, Ray. [[00:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=3564.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=3566.2400000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=3567.12s)]
*  He was unreal. [[00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=3567.68s)]
*  Showed a Ray Leonard. [[00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=3568.52s)]
*  No, who was it? [[00:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=3569.48s)]
*  Ray LaMontagne? [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=3570.04s)]
*  No, no, the singer. [[00:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=3571.04s)]
*  Ray Charles. [[00:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=3572.7200000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=3573.44s)]
*  I was going blank too, but he was phenomenal in that. [[00:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=3574.4s)]
*  So anyway, I had fun with him. [[00:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=3577.56s)]
*  He's a wonderful guy. [[00:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=3578.76s)]
*  Did he seem healthy? [[00:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=3579.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=3580.2400000000002s)]
*  He said, he's fine. [[00:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=3580.32s)]
*  He was great. [[00:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=3581.2400000000002s)]
*  He's happy. [[00:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=3582.52s)]
*  Um, I don't even know really what happened. [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=3583.88s)]
*  He didn't, you know, it's not my business and he didn't talk about it, but. [[00:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=3586.52s)]
*  But if you didn't know something happened, you wouldn't even know. [[00:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=3589.84s)]
*  No, you wouldn't have known. [[00:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=3591.52s)]
*  Wow. [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=3592.16s)]
*  He was doing fine. [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=3592.56s)]
*  And, and like I said, he was working late. [[00:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=3593.52s)]
*  Like he'd worked the night before sort of nine o'clock to five, cause they got to [[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=3596.08s)]
*  shut everything down so they can film it in actual place. [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=3600.24s)]
*  Right. [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=3603.12s)]
*  And so the next night was sort of eight o'clock to five again. [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=3603.8399999999997s)]
*  He was unreal. [[01:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=3606.72s)]
*  He was fine. [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=3607.48s)]
*  Did you guys go see a show or anything while you were out there or no? [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=3608.3599999999997s)]
*  No, no, I'm not big on going to shows. [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=3610.7599999999998s)]
*  Although my friend who I work with, Henrik Lundqvist went to the opening [[01:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=3613.24s)]
*  of the sphere in Vegas and he said, it's not like anything you've ever seen before. [[01:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=3617.7999999999997s)]
*  First of all, YouTube and then. [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=3623.2s)]
*  So it's the future. [[01:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=3625.3199999999997s)]
*  Huh? [[01:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=3626.56s)]
*  He says they have these AI robots that you talk to them. [[01:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=3627.2s)]
*  You think they're real people. [[01:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=3631.32s)]
*  He said, it's unbelievable. [[01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=3632.56s)]
*  I'm not gonna get this girl outdated for a while. [[01:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=3633.96s)]
*  So we're going to have a hockey coach. [[01:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=3636.2799999999997s)]
*  That'll be the first one, a hockey coach, AI. [[01:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=3638.6s)]
*  He's our hockey coach. [[01:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=3641.4s)]
*  You know, I always fantasize if it would be pretty cool, not fantasize. [[01:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=3644.0s)]
*  That's a weird word to say to another man, but I always thought about, [[01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=3646.84s)]
*  wouldn't it be neat if there was a team where people could sit at home and make [[01:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=3650.52s)]
*  like as a group vote really fast on what the next play should be and that it would [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=3653.48s)]
*  almost be a completely controlled team by like the fans, you know? [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=3658.96s)]
*  You probably would struggle in hockey because it's so quick. [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=3662.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=3666.68s)]
*  But you could probably do it in football for sure. [[01:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=3667.12s)]
*  Set up the play. [[01:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=3669.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=3671.6s)]
*  Football was, I think the sport that I thought about it the most. [[01:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=3671.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=3673.76s)]
*  Hockey would be hard. [[01:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=3673.88s)]
*  Maybe even baseball because you could pick the pitch that the pitcher throws. [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=3674.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=3678.32s)]
*  And who's pitching. [[01:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=3679.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=3680.4s)]
*  That'd be pretty interesting. [[01:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=3681.16s)]
*  Two of them you could do probably. [[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=3682.28s)]
*  Did you ever get to meet Michael Jackson or not? [[01:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=3683.76s)]
*  No, but I used to do hot yoga and Thousand Oaks with his brother. [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=3686.6s)]
*  Tito? [[01:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=3691.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=3692.08s)]
*  It was fun. [[01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=3692.64s)]
*  Nice, nice, nice guy. [[01:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=3693.32s)]
*  So, but I never met Michael Jackson though. [[01:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=3695.04s)]
*  I remember I got to talk to Hulk Hogan and he met Michael Jackson one time. [[01:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=3698.72s)]
*  It was just interesting. [[01:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=3704.2s)]
*  You know what? [[01:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=3705.0s)]
*  I got a great Hulk Hogan story. [[01:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=3705.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=3707.08s)]
*  So people don't know this, but Hulk used to live in Thousand Oaks too. [[01:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=3707.8s)]
*  And it was December 24th. [[01:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=3713.16s)]
*  We go to the Thousand Oaks mall and I'm getting last minute Christmas gifts for [[01:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=3716.4799999999996s)]
*  my kids who were at the time sort of 10, 12 and 14. [[01:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=3721.52s)]
*  So I put them all in the car and they had a valet parking for the, at the mall. [[01:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=3726.68s)]
*  So I get up, come out and I put all my bags in the car and I drive home. [[01:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=3732.0s)]
*  So I get a call around seven o'clock and he goes, Wayne? [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=3736.4399999999996s)]
*  I go, yeah. [[01:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=3739.3599999999997s)]
*  He says, Terry, I think his real name was Terry. [[01:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=3740.04s)]
*  Yeah, Terry Bollea. [[01:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=3742.6s)]
*  He goes, Terry, Terry. [[01:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=3743.7200000000003s)]
*  He goes, Hulk. [[01:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=3746.04s)]
*  He goes, we've got a problem. [[01:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=3747.4s)]
*  I go, what's the problem? [[01:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=3748.48s)]
*  He goes, we got the exact same car. [[01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=3749.36s)]
*  I got your car and your presents. [[01:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=3751.96s)]
*  You got my car, my presents. [[01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=3753.64s)]
*  So I go outside and I'm like, oh my God. [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=3756.56s)]
*  He goes, yeah, my kids are older. [[01:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=3758.44s)]
*  It's probably not going to work. [[01:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=3759.76s)]
*  So I said, I'll meet you halfway. [[01:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=3761.2000000000003s)]
*  So we drove back halfway together and we switched the cars out, got the [[01:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=3762.36s)]
*  presents and went home. [[01:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=3765.44s)]
*  True story. [[01:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=3767.36s)]
*  You guys got in each other's cars. [[01:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=3768.64s)]
*  Well, cause the valet guy just got in their exact same cars and we [[01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=3770.3999999999996s)]
*  weren't, you know, we weren't really paying attention because it's [[01:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=3773.2s)]
*  same colors and your kids wake up in Christmas morning and they all get [[01:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=3776.52s)]
*  bandanas, they get bandanas and body oil. [[01:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=3779.8799999999997s)]
*  Your 12 year old daughter is getting a jar of body oil. [[01:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=3787.08s)]
*  You're like, this seems a little weird. [[01:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=3789.52s)]
*  I do remember him saying, I don't think your kids are going to like [[01:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=3793.3199999999997s)]
*  what I got my kids. [[01:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=3795.8399999999997s)]
*  They're older. [[01:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=3797.56s)]
*  It's all cold. [[01:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=3798.3999999999996s)]
*  They got his kids. [[01:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=3799.08s)]
*  Did you, uh, when you met your wife, how'd you know that she was like [[01:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=3800.3999999999996s)]
*  the wife for you? [[01:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=3803.2799999999997s)]
*  Like my dad told me. [[01:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=3804.12s)]
*  Really? [[01:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=3805.2s)]
*  Gosh, he was a real leader then. [[01:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=3807.16s)]
*  The first week I said, what do you think? [[01:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=3809.8399999999997s)]
*  He goes, oh, she's a lifer. [[01:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=3811.3199999999997s)]
*  I go, you just met her. [[01:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=3812.52s)]
*  You know what? [[01:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=3814.44s)]
*  We had the same similarities. [[01:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=3814.8799999999997s)]
*  Like we love, we love both one have a family. [[01:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=3816.16s)]
*  We want to have kids. [[01:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=3819.2s)]
*  We both love sports. [[01:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=3821.72s)]
*  It's wonderful that I actually, her and I watched hockey together, [[01:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=3823.24s)]
*  baseball, football, basketball. [[01:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=3827.9199999999996s)]
*  She loves going to games. [[01:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=3829.6s)]
*  She loved growing up with our kids, going to all their sporting events [[01:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=3830.7599999999998s)]
*  and going to the girls, ballet and dancing. [[01:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=3834.3999999999996s)]
*  We just, um, we think the same way, I guess. [[01:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=3838.08s)]
*  And we're born 16 days apart. [[01:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=3841.56s)]
*  She's January 10th, I'm January 26th. [[01:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=3844.3999999999996s)]
*  Um, yeah, so we had a lot in common. [[01:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=3848.2799999999997s)]
*  You know, is it different being a dad to like a girl and a boy? [[01:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=3851.16s)]
*  Like, I don't have any children. [[01:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=3855.16s)]
*  Like I would like to have some one day, you know, but I don't have any. [[01:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=3856.68s)]
*  Some ways it's different in other ways. [[01:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=3858.8399999999997s)]
*  It's, it's not, um, you know, it's just, it's just a little bit different, [[01:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=3860.72s)]
*  but not really. [[01:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=3867.68s)]
*  Did it come easy to you being a dad? [[01:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=3868.68s)]
*  Some of my friends have a tough time and some of them. [[01:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=3870.12s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[01:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=3871.92s)]
*  I was, I loved being a dad. [[01:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=3872.2799999999997s)]
*  So yeah, you know, I always told my friends, you know, you do all your [[01:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=3874.2s)]
*  parenting until about 13 or 14. [[01:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=3878.0s)]
*  Um, they haven't learned by then you haven't done the job right. [[01:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=3880.64s)]
*  Right. [[01:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=3884.28s)]
*  And our biggest thing in our house was everybody can say, please [[01:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=3885.08s)]
*  thank you and excuse me. [[01:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=3888.12s)]
*  That was our biggest fight, not fight, but that was the biggest thing [[01:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=3889.28s)]
*  we drilled in all the time. [[01:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=3893.0s)]
*  And then when your kids get to be 16, 17, 18, then you become best friends. [[01:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=3894.8s)]
*  And so I don't really look at my kids as kids anywhere. [[01:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=3899.4s)]
*  I look at them as my closer friends. [[01:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=3902.56s)]
*  Simple as that. [[01:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=3904.4s)]
*  So it's interesting. [[01:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=3905.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=3905.88s)]
*  They kind of evolved in. [[01:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=3906.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=3907.04s)]
*  It did. [[01:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=3907.84s)]
*  I'd rather hang out with my kids at this age now than travel somewhere to [[01:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=3908.4s)]
*  go visit somebody for two days. [[01:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=3912.68s)]
*  You know, it's just as fun. [[01:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=3914.08s)]
*  Did you ever have to take your kids like, what did you ever take them [[01:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=3916.4s)]
*  trick or treating or something like that? [[01:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=3919.16s)]
*  So this is a funny story too. [[01:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=3921.2000000000003s)]
*  So we look, when I played for the New York Rangers, we had a apartment in [[01:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=3923.32s)]
*  a high rise. [[01:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=3928.28s)]
*  Did Patrick Watt play there? [[01:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=3928.76s)]
*  No, no, no. [[01:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=3929.44s)]
*  Um, Mark Messier was on that team. [[01:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=3930.52s)]
*  Brian Leach. [[01:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=3933.44s)]
*  So we lived in this high rise 16th floor, right? [[01:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=3934.4s)]
*  So it was our first year in Manhattan and your whole family's living [[01:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=3937.84s)]
*  in a high rise in Manhattan. [[01:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=3941.56s)]
*  If we had a three bedroom, there was at the time we only had three kids. [[01:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=3942.52s)]
*  So we had bedroom for my wife and I, one for the two boys and one for Paulina. [[01:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=3945.52s)]
*  And so I remember I said to the doorman the day before Halloween, I said, [[01:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=3951.12s)]
*  where do we trick or treat here? [[01:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=3955.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=3956.48s)]
*  He goes, Oh, everybody just walks through the building. [[01:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=3956.68s)]
*  And I'm thinking, no, no, no, no. [[01:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=3959.12s)]
*  So we left on just off of the street in Brooklyn. [[01:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=3960.88s)]
*  No, no, no. [[01:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=3964.88s)]
*  Listen. [[01:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=3965.52s)]
*  So I'm like, we're right on Madison Ave, 63rd and Madison. [[01:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=3966.28s)]
*  So I go out there and I said, okay. [[01:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=3970.16s)]
*  And I walked into every one of those stores that I know my [[01:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=3972.44s)]
*  wife had ventured into a lot. [[01:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=3974.8s)]
*  Prada, Gucci on. [[01:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=3976.36s)]
*  I said, you guys better have candy tomorrow at six o'clock. [[01:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=3978.84s)]
*  And so we walked the kids down. [[01:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=3981.56s)]
*  I said, you gotta be outside, right? [[01:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=3984.04s)]
*  You can't be walking. [[01:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=3985.7200000000003s)]
*  So we go into like Gucci and they give them stuff. [[01:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=3986.84s)]
*  We're going Prada, they're getting candy. [[01:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=3989.16s)]
*  I still think they do it today, but it made more sense to me than walking [[01:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=3991.4s)]
*  through an apartment building. [[01:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=3994.96s)]
*  You just want to be outside on Halloween. [[01:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=3996.04s)]
*  Oh, you have to, you have to run inside. [[01:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=3997.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=3999.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=3999.56s)]
*  So it was fun. [[01:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=3999.96s)]
*  When you did you, was it fun doing trick or treating when you were a kid? [[01:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=4001.32s)]
*  Like you remember what you dressed up as you just dress up as a hockey player. [[01:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=4003.88s)]
*  I always wanted to hockey player. [[01:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=4007.44s)]
*  So, and I'll tell you why, because every Halloween, it seemed like we had [[01:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=4008.8s)]
*  to practice that night, so we would be on the ice from like five o'clock to six. [[01:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=4013.84s)]
*  And you know, it gets dark by six 30 at that time of the year in Canada. [[01:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=4018.12s)]
*  So my dad would race me home. [[01:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=4022.2799999999997s)]
*  I get a pillowcase and I'd go up and down the street, get a ton of candy. [[01:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=4025.16s)]
*  And that was my, and I just left my hockey uniform on, just took my helmet off. [[01:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=4029.16s)]
*  And every place I went to the people, they all knew us coming as a hockey [[01:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=4033.56s)]

*  Remember the band Chicago? [[01:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2cP4O9HIU4&t=4422.8s)]
