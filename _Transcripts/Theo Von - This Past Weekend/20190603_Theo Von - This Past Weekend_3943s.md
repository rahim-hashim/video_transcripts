*  Because it's basically they're just they're in there laying up in there. It's like being at the hampton inn [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osVYiVXOkt8&t=679.82s)]

*  If there's a country that i've visited that I could go easily see myself to live in it would be australia [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osVYiVXOkt8&t=916.3s)]
*  And then one of the things that I loved [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osVYiVXOkt8&t=924.22s)]
*  Is that they still have a strong sense of being australian it feels like it felt like to me this is my perception [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osVYiVXOkt8&t=926.7s)]
*  And at the airport you could still go say bye to your loved ones or you could meet somebody at the gate [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osVYiVXOkt8&t=935.1s)]
*  so it was just really beautiful because [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osVYiVXOkt8&t=941.5s)]
*  You still see like a lot of like what it means to travel and be somewhere new [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osVYiVXOkt8&t=944.62s)]
*  Like in america, you can't see that anymore. I remember when I was young [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osVYiVXOkt8&t=950.62s)]
*  Your mom could walk you to the gate and watch you cry in the little tunnel as you flew off to meet grandma [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osVYiVXOkt8&t=953.9000000000001s)]
*  And that's natural, you know if you're a child and you're about to fly four hours to see some senior citizens [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osVYiVXOkt8&t=961.1800000000001s)]
*  I mean that'll make that'll bring a tear to anybody's eye [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osVYiVXOkt8&t=968.14s)]
*  And especially if you're if you're if your step grandfather is addicted to marlboro reds [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osVYiVXOkt8&t=972.86s)]
*  And he does them indoors and shit and you can't even you know [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osVYiVXOkt8&t=980.1400000000001s)]
*  so [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osVYiVXOkt8&t=983.6600000000001s)]
*  right after dessert right after a couple cups of pudding at grandma's you gotta sit there and [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osVYiVXOkt8&t=984.5400000000001s)]
*  And get that secondhand smoke off of poppy [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osVYiVXOkt8&t=989.58s)]
*  but [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osVYiVXOkt8&t=993.26s)]
*  But yeah, man [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osVYiVXOkt8&t=994.86s)]
*  One of the things about that is you when you see people hug at the gate and you see people like say goodbye to each other [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osVYiVXOkt8&t=996.7s)]
*  At the gate like you could in australia [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osVYiVXOkt8&t=1001.9000000000001s)]
*  You see like human affection you see human interaction [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osVYiVXOkt8&t=1005.9000000000001s)]
*  And it makes you kind of it gives like more of a meaning to what travel is [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osVYiVXOkt8&t=1009.82s)]
*  And so I saw I would see that at the different place and we flew I think to I think we had [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osVYiVXOkt8&t=1014.5400000000001s)]
*  Maybe seven flights or six flights within the country once we got there [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osVYiVXOkt8&t=1020.14s)]
*  And you're like, oh wow, this is oh, yeah [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osVYiVXOkt8&t=1026.46s)]
*  this person is coming to see someone this person is leaving someone they care about and [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osVYiVXOkt8&t=1029.42s)]
*  And it just it reminded me of that time in the u.s when you could do that [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osVYiVXOkt8&t=1034.38s)]
*  You could go to the gate and greet somebody [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osVYiVXOkt8&t=1037.9s)]
*  And greet a loved one [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osVYiVXOkt8&t=1040.94s)]
*  You didn't have to have a ticket. You could still be there to see them come or to see them go [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osVYiVXOkt8&t=1042.7s)]
*  And I miss that [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osVYiVXOkt8&t=1047.8999999999999s)]
*  It just added so much more meaning to travel [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osVYiVXOkt8&t=1049.8999999999999s)]
*  It added so much more meaning to coming and going [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osVYiVXOkt8&t=1053.8999999999999s)]
*  Because you saw others, you know just to see somebody say goodbye to someone [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osVYiVXOkt8&t=1058.54s)]
*  It's like oh wow, that's human interaction. That's [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osVYiVXOkt8&t=1063.98s)]
*  That's connection [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osVYiVXOkt8&t=1066.86s)]
*  To see somebody give a kiss to somebody that they that they you know, maybe they they're not going to see them for [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osVYiVXOkt8&t=1068.7s)]
*  You know a couple weeks or a couple months or who knows how long and in your mind you process. Oh, I wonder [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osVYiVXOkt8&t=1076.3s)]

*  You know if this is their first time this ever their first weekend that they ever hung out and it was great [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osVYiVXOkt8&t=1084.6200000000001s)]

*  I needed you because you knew something that I didn't or that you [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osVYiVXOkt8&t=1666.3s)]
*  When it came to a moment where I was going to show you that I couldn't help myself or that [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osVYiVXOkt8&t=1673.9s)]
*  That was a moment. I just couldn't do I couldn't do those moments where [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osVYiVXOkt8&t=1679.34s)]
*  It looked like I couldn't [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osVYiVXOkt8&t=1684.14s)]
*  Fend for myself [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osVYiVXOkt8&t=1686.54s)]
*  I don't know. I know some of that's all over the place. I know some of that's not [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osVYiVXOkt8&t=1687.98s)]
*  I just don't like that [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osVYiVXOkt8&t=1690.78s)]
*  You know, I like to be able to do things. I'm just so used to it [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osVYiVXOkt8&t=1692.78s)]
*  Like I think at a level even inside of me in the fabric of me like in the stitching of my core [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osVYiVXOkt8&t=1696.78s)]
*  You know, I think I just realized at a certain point in my life bit [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osVYiVXOkt8&t=1703.98s)]
*  You know when at a youthful point that or something or even when I was a zygote that [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osVYiVXOkt8&t=1706.8600000000001s)]
*  I was just trying to figure it out. I just didn't like that [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osVYiVXOkt8&t=1713.02s)]
*  Point that or something or even when I was a zygote that I'm gonna have to do this myself [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osVYiVXOkt8&t=1716.14s)]
*  And [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osVYiVXOkt8&t=1724.6200000000001s)]
*  And that's what i'm gonna do [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osVYiVXOkt8&t=1725.98s)]
*  And so i'm not i'm never not gonna do that. It's almost like I made a deal with myself [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osVYiVXOkt8&t=1728.38s)]
*  like i'm never not gonna do this myself [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osVYiVXOkt8&t=1732.14s)]
*  and so [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osVYiVXOkt8&t=1734.8600000000001s)]
*  Now that the touring gets a little different and people are on board and people are helping [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osVYiVXOkt8&t=1736.46s)]
*  It's like it's really tough for me to let somebody [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osVYiVXOkt8&t=1740.6200000000001s)]
*  Help me [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osVYiVXOkt8&t=1743.9s)]
*  That's one thing i've kind of realized it's really really tough for me to let somebody help me [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osVYiVXOkt8&t=1746.54s)]
*  And it and it almost have an adverse reaction to it [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osVYiVXOkt8&t=1750.8600000000001s)]
*  Because if I show you that I need help from you then that means that [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osVYiVXOkt8&t=1760.06s)]
*  That that gives you an ability to connect with me and that's scary to me I think so that's why [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osVYiVXOkt8&t=1766.46s)]
*  I don't know some of this stuff [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osVYiVXOkt8&t=1773.5800000000002s)]
*  I need to do a little bit of work on and think about but [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osVYiVXOkt8&t=1774.46s)]
*  It was just something that was heavily on my mind. So I wanted to share it with you guys [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osVYiVXOkt8&t=1777.3400000000001s)]
*  But thank you so much to everybody in Australia that came out i'm happy to be back home [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osVYiVXOkt8&t=1781.9s)]
*  uh [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osVYiVXOkt8&t=1786.22s)]
*  I have some jet lag. I just literally about seven minutes ago. Just got hit by jet lag pretty heavy [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osVYiVXOkt8&t=1787.66s)]
*  Which is a tough tough thing to try and explain [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osVYiVXOkt8&t=1793.1000000000001s)]
*  How you're feeling at the same time? [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osVYiVXOkt8&t=1796.46s)]
*  Um [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osVYiVXOkt8&t=1798.54s)]
*  And i'm sorry for taking you guys down that wormhole, but I just don't I wish I knew exactly what I was thinking more [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osVYiVXOkt8&t=1800.8600000000001s)]
*  But man I just it really [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osVYiVXOkt8&t=1808.3s)]
*  It really hurts me somewhere to admit that I need help [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osVYiVXOkt8&t=1811.98s)]
*  Or to admit that I that i'm not doing something by myself [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osVYiVXOkt8&t=1815.82s)]
*  You know, it just makes me [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osVYiVXOkt8&t=1820.94s)]
*  Feel scared it's a scary thing [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osVYiVXOkt8&t=1825.66s)]
*  And I didn't know that until I was on this experience and i'm in another country and you know [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osVYiVXOkt8&t=1828.46s)]
*  There's a group of people that are helping out and they're helping and i'm just [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osVYiVXOkt8&t=1832.78s)]
*  I was so upset and I couldn't figure out why [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osVYiVXOkt8&t=1836.54s)]
*  And I wasn't upset with the audience or like the the shows or I didn't there wasn't anything like that [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osVYiVXOkt8&t=1839.82s)]
*  it was all just you know behind the scenes and um [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osVYiVXOkt8&t=1844.38s)]
*  And so i'm grateful that the tour manager [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osVYiVXOkt8&t=1849.02s)]
*  And uh, and their company like put up with me for a couple days while I figured it out [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osVYiVXOkt8&t=1851.18s)]
*  And then I started going to some different uh 12 step meetings and it helped me kind of calm down and get into a better space [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osVYiVXOkt8&t=1855.26s)]
*  um [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osVYiVXOkt8&t=1860.6999999999998s)]
*  but [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osVYiVXOkt8&t=1861.9799999999998s)]
*  Anyway, uh enough about that man. I want to take a couple of calls that came in. Uh, here we go [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osVYiVXOkt8&t=1863.5s)]

*  Not that long ago, but you said something like i'm afraid to let myself grow up with the things [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osVYiVXOkt8&t=1884.3000000000002s)]
*  Without the things I always wanted because they're not there [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osVYiVXOkt8&t=1890.6200000000001s)]
*  And it made me think [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osVYiVXOkt8&t=1894.14s)]
*  a lot and I was like wow [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osVYiVXOkt8&t=1895.9s)]
*  There's a lot of things that I thought I would have by the time i'm 40 or things that I thought I would do [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osVYiVXOkt8&t=1898.8600000000001s)]
*  and uh [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osVYiVXOkt8&t=1904.38s)]
*  Try and stand up was always something that was a bucket list item, but I never really thought [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osVYiVXOkt8&t=1905.98s)]
*  I don't know. I feel like it was something I would have to work a long time [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osVYiVXOkt8&t=1910.22s)]
*  to be able to do one time and uh [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osVYiVXOkt8&t=1913.74s)]
*  Yeah, man, I just [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osVYiVXOkt8&t=1917.1000000000001s)]
*  Wanted to give it a shot. So tonight [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osVYiVXOkt8&t=1918.6200000000001s)]
*  We got about five minutes [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osVYiVXOkt8&t=1921.42s)]
*  And uh, yeah, man, i'm gonna give it a go. So I want to thank you for the [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osVYiVXOkt8&t=1924.22s)]
*  inspiration and uh and the laughs and all that so yeah [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osVYiVXOkt8&t=1928.3600000000001s)]
*  Word man. Well, thank you for calling in with that dude. Good luck with that first time. Wow [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osVYiVXOkt8&t=1933.1000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, look I think sometimes it's like [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osVYiVXOkt8&t=1939.98s)]
*  You know, we create these stories. We have these stories that get built into us that we can't do certain things [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osVYiVXOkt8&t=1943.3400000000001s)]
*  You know, I was just talking with a friend of mine yesterday, you know, she's going on a vacation and [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osVYiVXOkt8&t=1951.3400000000001s)]
*  She just spent, you know, like five thousand dollars to go on a vacation, which is a big sum of money [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osVYiVXOkt8&t=1956.14s)]
*  And it's a vacation that you know [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osVYiVXOkt8&t=1962.0600000000002s)]
*  And she said, you know, I just I never knew if I could [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osVYiVXOkt8&t=1964.6200000000001s)]
*  She's like as i'm spending the money she's like something felt wrong about it [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osVYiVXOkt8&t=1967.58s)]
*  And she's like I was it felt wrong because I was spending the money on something that I wanted to do for myself [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osVYiVXOkt8&t=1972.86s)]
*  And not spending the money on just some [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osVYiVXOkt8&t=1979.4199999999998s)]
*  Like [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osVYiVXOkt8&t=1982.6999999999998s)]
*  Oh, you have to save for this you have to save for that or you have to have this savings plan or it was like [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osVYiVXOkt8&t=1983.74s)]
*  It was it was like against the norm. It was just me spending money on something that I wanted for myself [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osVYiVXOkt8&t=1989.6599999999999s)]
*  Even a good experience like travel like you can't just up and travel for a month [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osVYiVXOkt8&t=1994.54s)]
*  And she's like, yes, I can [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osVYiVXOkt8&t=2001.58s)]
*  She's like and as I did it, it just felt so wrong [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osVYiVXOkt8&t=2004.54s)]
*  But at the same time it just felt so kind of perfect like oh this is what i'm supposed to do [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osVYiVXOkt8&t=2006.62s)]
*  This is i'm supposed to do things that I want to do in the world. I'm supposed to do new experiences [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osVYiVXOkt8&t=2011.34s)]
*  I'm not just supposed to save every dime [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osVYiVXOkt8&t=2016.7s)]
*  And put it away in this shoe box or put it away for this and have safe keeping and [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osVYiVXOkt8&t=2019.66s)]
*  And never try the things I always wanted to try [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osVYiVXOkt8&t=2025.98s)]
*  And it really hit me I was like, wow, that's so interesting [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osVYiVXOkt8&t=2030.38s)]
*  Yeah, when you spend money on something that you kind of want sometimes [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osVYiVXOkt8&t=2033.8200000000002s)]
*  especially like a thing like travel or a musical instrument or or doing something that's [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osVYiVXOkt8&t=2037.9s)]
*  That you've always wanted to do but that's out of the societal norm [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osVYiVXOkt8&t=2044.94s)]
*  It feels foreign almost to us [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osVYiVXOkt8&t=2049.74s)]
*  Because sometimes we get built into this world where it's like, oh, this is the next thing [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osVYiVXOkt8&t=2053.66s)]
*  Oh, you go to you go finish school then you go to college then you get this and then you get a job and then you [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osVYiVXOkt8&t=2058.14s)]
*  Get another job and then you [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osVYiVXOkt8&t=2063.4199999999996s)]
*  it's like [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osVYiVXOkt8&t=2065.8199999999997s)]
*  Well, what if we didn't do it that way? [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osVYiVXOkt8&t=2067.4199999999996s)]
*  What if one day I just said to my boss, hey, i'm gonna go for a month and travel which is what my friend is doing [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osVYiVXOkt8&t=2070.7799999999997s)]
*  You know, she said i'm gonna go for a month and travel and then I bought the ticket and next thing [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osVYiVXOkt8&t=2077.2599999999998s)]
*  You know, I feel like i'm wandering out into a whole different [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osVYiVXOkt8&t=2081.1s)]
*  world of [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osVYiVXOkt8&t=2084.62s)]
*  Interaction [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osVYiVXOkt8&t=2086.92s)]
*  With life than I have been previously because i'm doing something that I want to do [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osVYiVXOkt8&t=2089.02s)]
*  um [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osVYiVXOkt8&t=2095.66s)]
*  But yeah, like you said it's like you think it can take you know [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osVYiVXOkt8&t=2097.74s)]
*  You thought staying up with something you had to try, you know work at for a long time just to get up and even try [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osVYiVXOkt8&t=2100.22s)]
*  Dude, I remember I drove across the causeway about 30 miles [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osVYiVXOkt8&t=2105.1s)]
*  I've been upset my whole life that my dad was so old when I was born [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osVYiVXOkt8&t=2108.94s)]
*  And i've been making fun of him [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osVYiVXOkt8&t=2114.54s)]
*  In my head to make me feel okay [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osVYiVXOkt8&t=2117.7400000000002s)]
*  About him being so old and then I just stood up on stage and started telling jokes about it [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osVYiVXOkt8&t=2121.34s)]
*  And so it was just [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osVYiVXOkt8&t=2128.1400000000003s)]
*  You know, it's and everybody has their own experience but getting up and talking about something that's just been running around in your head [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osVYiVXOkt8&t=2130.3799999999997s)]
*  You know a lot of the work for trying stand-up has already been done [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osVYiVXOkt8&t=2139.9s)]
*  You've been alive [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osVYiVXOkt8&t=2144.3799999999997s)]
*  That's the research [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osVYiVXOkt8&t=2146.94s)]
*  The research for doing stand-up in the practice is being alive [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osVYiVXOkt8&t=2149.42s)]
*  Now the the repetition is something that takes, you know time but [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osVYiVXOkt8&t=2153.66s)]
*  The ability for it for you to do it to have the gunpowder that's already packed inside of you [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osVYiVXOkt8&t=2157.66s)]
*  And the microphone that's just the that's the flint and that's what's going to light it [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osVYiVXOkt8&t=2165.58s)]
*  But let's hear the rest of your call thank you for calling in christian yeah, man, right [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osVYiVXOkt8&t=2173.42s)]
*  I wanted to thank you and share the fact that i'm gonna [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osVYiVXOkt8&t=2177.58s)]

*  What i'm saying is this man. I never got over the fact that she had [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osVYiVXOkt8&t=2333.46s)]
*  Uh already hooked up with some of the guy before we got together. I never got over it [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osVYiVXOkt8&t=2338.26s)]
*  I always let it just fester on me and just this weird jealousy. It gave me a thing to be angry about [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osVYiVXOkt8&t=2343.22s)]
*  And in the end that shit was all about me man [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osVYiVXOkt8&t=2350.1s)]

*  You know [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osVYiVXOkt8&t=2845.38s)]
*  It's one of those places where if you don't know where you are in memphis [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osVYiVXOkt8&t=2846.5s)]
*  You you might not need to stop at the gas station [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osVYiVXOkt8&t=2850.74s)]
*  Oh, yeah, if you don't know where you are in memphis, you might be dead [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osVYiVXOkt8&t=2853.94s)]

*  And it's about people in memphis shooting each other [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osVYiVXOkt8&t=2861.06s)]
*  And then the cops kind of don't know who it is, but they know who it is [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osVYiVXOkt8&t=2864.2599999999998s)]
*  Uh, let's hear more some places there. They call the gas stations murder marks [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osVYiVXOkt8&t=2868.1s)]
*  Damn [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osVYiVXOkt8&t=2872.82s)]

*  The barbecue chips boy, you better get your chips quick son [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osVYiVXOkt8&t=2881.3s)]
*  So, uh, but anyway, I just want to know what you think if you ever been to memphis what you think about it about the area [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osVYiVXOkt8&t=2886.9s)]
*  uh [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osVYiVXOkt8&t=2893.86s)]
*  And uh stuff like that, but but anyway [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osVYiVXOkt8&t=2895.06s)]
*  Uh gang gang brother gang gang man [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osVYiVXOkt8&t=2898.42s)]
*  I mean, I think you have a lot of cities in america where they have you know [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osVYiVXOkt8&t=2901.78s)]
*  Some of the crime problem has gotten a little bit out of hand in specific areas [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osVYiVXOkt8&t=2905.2200000000003s)]
*  You know memphis is one of those places where you're getting a lot of crime, you know places you see a lot of poverty [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osVYiVXOkt8&t=2909.1400000000003s)]
*  You know you have a lot of it [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osVYiVXOkt8&t=2915.2200000000003s)]
*  Places where you see also a lot of poverty in black community. You have a lot of um [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osVYiVXOkt8&t=2917.2200000000003s)]
*  You have a lot of crime, you know because over time it's been one of the more impoverished [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osVYiVXOkt8&t=2921.94s)]
*  you know, and also they have a lot of like a lot of gangsters and [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osVYiVXOkt8&t=2927.1400000000003s)]
*  And that sort of thing and uh [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osVYiVXOkt8&t=2931.38s)]
*  You know you see a lot of those guys with you know, also, you know [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osVYiVXOkt8&t=2934.9s)]
*  Making like guns and murder and that type of stuff look cool [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osVYiVXOkt8&t=2938.7400000000002s)]
*  Um, so I think that's something you probably have in memphis is a lot of that [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osVYiVXOkt8&t=2942.58s)]
*  You know, uh in new wallins, they have it chicago has it [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osVYiVXOkt8&t=2947.54s)]
*  um [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osVYiVXOkt8&t=2952.82s)]
*  New wallins, it seems to be getting real bad [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osVYiVXOkt8&t=2954.26s)]
*  Uh [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osVYiVXOkt8&t=2956.9s)]
*  Or just the newspapers say that areas if you go to nola.com it's [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osVYiVXOkt8&t=2958.1000000000004s)]
*  You know, it just seems to be something that happens in some of these communities where it's hard to [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osVYiVXOkt8&t=2962.7400000000002s)]
*  It's like how do you eradicate this problem? I think some of it is time [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osVYiVXOkt8&t=2967.1400000000003s)]
*  You know as you get [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osVYiVXOkt8&t=2971.46s)]
*  You know as more [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osVYiVXOkt8&t=2973.38s)]
*  opportunity [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osVYiVXOkt8&t=2975.44s)]
*  You have more opportunity and a lot of diff for different [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osVYiVXOkt8&t=2976.82s)]
*  You know for different ethnicities and in in america more opportunity to [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osVYiVXOkt8&t=2980.98s)]
*  Make money then you'll see [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osVYiVXOkt8&t=2986.26s)]
*  You know, uh [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osVYiVXOkt8&t=2988.6600000000003s)]
*  More comfortable lifestyles where it won't be as much, you know as much crime and as much poverty [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osVYiVXOkt8&t=2990.34s)]
*  um [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osVYiVXOkt8&t=2996.5s)]
*  But yeah, I think sometimes the onus could also be taken on by some of these individual communities. It's like [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osVYiVXOkt8&t=2999.0600000000004s)]
*  You know it would be [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osVYiVXOkt8&t=3006.0200000000004s)]
*  You know, it's like how does how do you stop this kind of stuff within these communities? It's like I would love [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osVYiVXOkt8&t=3007.86s)]
*  You know, and maybe this does happen and I just don't see it [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osVYiVXOkt8&t=3014.42s)]
*  It's like how do you stop like black on black violence? Like, you know, it's scary sometimes to I remember growing up in louisiana [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osVYiVXOkt8&t=3016.98s)]
*  It would be scary sometimes to have a black friend [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osVYiVXOkt8&t=3024.58s)]
*  because if [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osVYiVXOkt8&t=3027.7s)]
*  A lot of black guys got murdered [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osVYiVXOkt8&t=3029.7s)]
*  And you just would read about it every day on the newspaper see it on the news [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osVYiVXOkt8&t=3032.5s)]
*  Like damn man, that's scary [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osVYiVXOkt8&t=3036.42s)]
*  You know it uh [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osVYiVXOkt8&t=3039.8599999999997s)]
*  And then I think it's not it gives a scary vibe to [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osVYiVXOkt8&t=3042.26s)]
*  You know, I can't even imagine do being a young black guy in some of those places [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osVYiVXOkt8&t=3046.82s)]
*  um [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osVYiVXOkt8&t=3052.42s)]
*  Would be scary [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osVYiVXOkt8&t=3053.86s)]
*  And and look i'm sure it's all types of ethnicities and it's all types of uh [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osVYiVXOkt8&t=3055.54s)]
*  People and stuff. So I don't even know what i'm talking about [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osVYiVXOkt8&t=3059.94s)]
*  um [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osVYiVXOkt8&t=3062.7400000000002s)]
*  But I think over time some of that will go away [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osVYiVXOkt8&t=3063.86s)]
*  But some of it is it's just like we gotta you know, like if we if we continue to champion this sort of like that [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osVYiVXOkt8&t=3066.74s)]
*  It's cool to be like a gangster and that kind of shit [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osVYiVXOkt8&t=3071.7799999999997s)]
*  Then I don't know if that kind of stuff gets helped [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osVYiVXOkt8&t=3074.8199999999997s)]
*  Um, you know some of it's a culture thing some of it's a like what's cool? [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osVYiVXOkt8&t=3078.02s)]
*  uh [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osVYiVXOkt8&t=3083.86s)]
*  But then also it might be fun as fuck to be a straight-up gangster, bro be running around at night playing, you know [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osVYiVXOkt8&t=3085.2999999999997s)]
*  You know all the [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osVYiVXOkt8&t=3092.34s)]
*  The kids that you know who have two parents and a little bit of cash [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osVYiVXOkt8&t=3093.62s)]
*  They're inside playing modern warfare and the kids who's out there struggling those dudes are out there fucking [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osVYiVXOkt8&t=3096.74s)]
*  Running ducking over by the murder mark trying to drink a fucking get through all 32 ounces [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osVYiVXOkt8&t=3102.82s)]
*  Before they go to that big gulp in the sky [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osVYiVXOkt8&t=3108.66s)]
*  The lord before they go see the lord. It's the freaking murder mark [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osVYiVXOkt8&t=3112.1s)]
*  Um, but all aboard bro, you know, I get that bulletproof train son [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osVYiVXOkt8&t=3115.2999999999997s)]

*  but yeah, memphis fuck dude first 48 gives a bad vibe to that city in the sense that you just [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osVYiVXOkt8&t=3125.22s)]
*  Everybody's shooting at each other over there. It always seems like [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osVYiVXOkt8&t=3130.66s)]
*  um [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osVYiVXOkt8&t=3134.5s)]
*  But yeah, I think sometimes that's a community problem where it's like how do you you know like it, you know, it's [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osVYiVXOkt8&t=3136.2599999999998s)]

*  Some things that just after a while seems like are these things gonna go away? [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osVYiVXOkt8&t=3146.5s)]
*  Or maybe they are going away and the media just keeps playing them up and acting like they aren't you know, I don't know [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osVYiVXOkt8&t=3150.34s)]

*  I just want to apologize to anybody [[01:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osVYiVXOkt8&t=3743.3199999999997s)]
*  I know there's sometimes where people reach out and like I try to get people tickets and a lot of times I try [[01:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osVYiVXOkt8&t=3744.84s)]
*  To help and and a lot of times tickets are sold out to to to to shows [[01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osVYiVXOkt8&t=3749.0s)]
*  Be careful. There's a lot of second and third party websites that will sell tickets at extraordinary prices [[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osVYiVXOkt8&t=3754.2s)]
*  Those are not the regular ticket sites [[01:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osVYiVXOkt8&t=3760.52s)]
*  Those are second and third party. You got to look at the name [[01:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osVYiVXOkt8&t=3763.7999999999997s)]

*  And it tickets $200 for the show. I don't sell tickets at those high prices [[01:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osVYiVXOkt8&t=3771.9599999999996s)]
